are social conditions in ecuador beginning to deteriorate a report released in june 2018 on poverty and inequality by ecuador s national institute of statistics and census found that poverty crept up slightly between june 2017 and june 2018 with 24 5 of the population living in poverty up from 23 1 the year before while these numbers may appear low they could be a sign of things to come as the ecuadorian government under lenín moreno doubles down on economic policies favoring austerity and deregulation while attempting to discredit the left the political and economic prognosis appeared quite different when moreno was elected in april 2017 representing the center left ruling party alianza país country alliance narrowly defeating neoliberal banker guillermo lasso the latin american left against the backdrop of a resurgent right turn was relieved onlookers expected moreno to continue the progressive advances his predecessor rafael correa had made during his tenure in office under the citizens revolution with perhaps a softer edge but once in office moreno swiftly pivoted on his campaign promises governing with a right wing neoliberal agenda that has already chipped away at the gains of the citizens revolution and could threaten to bury it entirely alianza país is now split moreno who served as correa s vice president from 2007 to 2013 has changed the party leadership and its priorities correa and his supporters left the party in january 2018 and have not been allowed to form their own party structures since meanwhile under moreno s leadership alianza país has lost much of its previous support since his inauguration moreno has claimed his government inherited an economic and institutional crisis presenting neoliberal adjustment policies and austerity as the solution in the process moreno and his allies have lambasted correa era infrastructure projects as examples of government corruption and mismanagement as well as cornerstone education and technology projects such as the innovation hub known as yachay city of knowledge he also cautioned that the recently refurbished oil refinery in esmeraldas was severely damaged its scheduled temporary shutdown was postponed repeatedly until it was finally enacted in march 2019 moreno has claimed that correa installed a camera in the presidential palace to monitor his every move the new authorities also tried to put correa on trial on numerous occasions in a clear attempt of political persecution one of the attempts was to put correa on trial for kidnapping without noteworthy evidence interpol failed to issue a red alert notice citing human rights far from a personal feud between two leading politicians less than two years into his term in office moreno has proven that despite being elected as a candidate of the left his government is executing a right wing agenda the citizens revolution the citizens revolution led by rafael correa from 2007 to 2017 followed a period of high instability and dissatisfaction with the neoliberal development model influential and politically well connected business groups were able to negotiate special regulations and capture rents through cartels and monopolies between 1996 and 2006 no elected president had been able to complete his term of office in the late 1990s ecuador slid into a severe crisis following financial deregulation economic output plummeted and the state shelled out billions to rescue the banks then president jamil mahuad whose government had close ties with the financial sector was eventually overthrown in a popular uprising in early 2000 shortly after announcing the country s official dollarization even before the crisis inequality had increased massively in the period between 1999 and 2005 hundreds of thousands of ecuadorians left the country mainly to spain and the united states the remittances they sent home along with rising oil revenues were essential to economic recovery however while economic crisis eased political instability continued in 2005 the next elected president lucio gutiérrez was toppled the slogan que se vayan todos or out with them all illustrated that protests took aim at the entire political economic establishment rafael correa s election marked a fundamental change in ecuadorian politics his citizens revolution passed one of the world s most progressive constitutions in 2008 approved by popular vote in 2008 the new constitution marked a clear departure from neoliberalism by enshrining the principle of good living or buen vivir in spanish or sumak kawsay in quechua and emphasized social and cultural rights a stronger role of the state and socially and environmentally sustainable development given the dissatisfaction with the established party system and its ties to business elites correa s actions to limit the influence of the special interest groups were highly popular his approval rating was close to 74 percent in 2007 and only dropped below 50 percent in 2016 according to latinobarometro the correa government owed much of its popularity to its massive investments in public infrastructure roads hydroelectric power plants schools health centers and other projects in order to reduce reliance on volatile oil revenues the government spearheaded a fight against tax evasion and avoidance leading to significant increases in fiscal revenues including social security from 12 7 percent in 2006 to 20 5 percent in 2015 oil revenues were no longer invested abroad for low returns at home but used to strengthen social and economic infrastructure in ecuador many of these investments help to stabilize today s foreign trade balance ecuador s per capita economic growth averaged 1 5 percent between 2006 and 2016 well above the growth rate of 0 6 percent from 1980 to 2006 the proportion of residents with unmet basic needs fell from 52 percent in 2006 to less than 36 percent in 2014 however the government faced criticism for pushing through an extractivist agenda and not going far enough to put the rights of nature enshrined in the constitution into practice the government s relations to social movements and trade unions were fraught social movements opposed correa s rejection of a rapid transition from extractivism which has long been a cornerstone of ecuador s economy at the same time some of the better organized trade unions and social movement organizations that had gained niches of influence in the government before the citizens revolution found themselves shut out of political decision making under the correa government when correa began to push through an anti corporatist agenda the most affected groups were elite representatives but trade unions and social movements lost presence within the state apparatus as well in response these groups started to oppose the government beyond that the correa government s confrontational style fueled conflicts with social movements government attempts to withdraw legal status from the environmentalist ngo acción ecológica certainly contributed to the narrative of an authoritarian government as well as government attempts to ouster the indigenous conaie federation from its head office in quito allegedly due to continued violations of the legal terms of usage while the correa government denounced violence by anti government groups indigenous and environmentalist movements saw government support for extractivism as the root cause for violence though in some cases these movements charged correa with not going far enough most saw his party as more supportive of the rights of nature than other parties owing in part to social movements initial support for moreno the citizens revolution entered a difficult period in 2014 in part due to the crash in oil prices oil exports plummeted from about 13 billion in 2014 to little more than 5 billion in 2016 total exports fell from 25 8 billion to just 16 8 billion a devastating earthquake in 2016 worsened the situation due to dollarization the government had less recourse for adjusting exchange rates credit requirements rose while interest rates for new loans increased ecuador s economic output stagnated in 2015 and fell by 1 2 percent in 2016 according to eclac figures yet by 2017 the economy was growing again the correa government withstood pressures for more radical steps towards austerity that would have deepened the crisis instead it developed creative mechanisms to withstand external shocks and stabilize the economy for instance by making use of central bank loans to the government given the severity of the unexpected events and the limited capacity of a dollarized economy to respond the economic downturn was surprisingly mild and short compared to previous crises despite that ecuador s conservative opposition portrayed a supposedly large and unproductive state apparatus as the root cause of an unprecedented economic emergency though corruption in large infrastructure projects no doubt played a role accounts in corporate media are exaggerated in particular opponents used the large scale corruption scandals surrounding the state owned oil company petroecuador and the brazilian construction company odebrecht to emphasize a narrative of a rotten state that begged a radical shift in the country s development strategy elected left governing right once elected moreno declared that unlike correa he would fight corruption and reduce debts by adopting the right wing s framing moreno gave legitimacy to neoliberal policies and the return of business elites to the highest levers of state power net public debt which is more telling than gross public debt figures was still relatively low when moreno took office in may 2017 it had reached 27 7 percent up from 12 2 percent in 2009 but still far from the 65 1 percent it had reached in 2000 in early 2018 moreno gained support for institutional changes through a seven part referendum carried out in february 2018 without the approval of the constitutional court and lacking basic conditions of a fair process questions on the referendum were politically misleading for example it proposed to restrict the territory for additional oil production in yasuní national park from 1030 to 300 hectares but the state owned extraction company only planned to drill in 236 hectares of the national park even prior to the referendum meaning the passage of that section of the referendum meant little in practice moreno also proposed to add close to 60 000 hectares to the zone as a way to cull support from environmentally concerned or progressive citizens while planning to loosen restrictions to oil extraction and tourism in the buffer zones close to the park meanwhile the government s attempt to repeal a capital gains law revealed the new administration s ties with the real estate sector without proof the moreno administration presented the law as responsible for a downturn in the construction sector one of the main goals of the referendum however was to block correa s eventual return to power by banning reelection and to dissolve the council for citizen s participation and social control cpccs the autonomous cpccs was part of a transparency effort responsible for appointing authorities to various federal electoral and judicial posts the new government labeled it as too close to correa and made it responsible for the selection of officials who turned out to be corrupt instead of trying to find ways to make it more autonomous the referendum gave the executive branch alone the right to nominate the members of a new transitional council the transitional council cpccs t was granted powers far beyond the constitution justified as necessary to fighting corruption cpccs t president julio césar trujillo oversaw the ouster of dozens of high ranking officials in the justice department and state regulatory agencies and appointed interim successors in august 2018 the cpccs t purged the constitutional court judges alleging that their predecessors in the original cpccs had not acted independently when designating the judges although new judges have been selected in a questionable process ecuador has been without a constitutional court for months today the moreno government caters to the interests of rent oriented sectors whose influence the correa administration had sought to curb with some success although moreno initially kept correa s economics team mostly intact he has since replaced the remaining progressive economists with neoliberal ideologues and representatives of private sector interests most notably moreno appointed richard martínez former president of the ecuadorian business committee as minister of finance in may 2018 marking a radical shift to the right in comparison to moreno s first finance minister carlos de la torre while martínez is moreno s third finance minister he is the first to accept moreno s figures on the country s debt moreno s figure of about 60 billion in public debt is an exaggeration as it includes liabilities such as fines from international arbitrations that are usually not counted as public debt as well potential fines that may turn into liabilities in future moreno has used the calculation to accuse correa of surpassing the official limit for public debt which the citizens revolution set at 40 percent of gdp which he used to justify another lawsuit against correa this along with other actions has undermined investors confidence in ecuador s ability to service its debt and increased the risk premium for government bonds in spite of rising oil prices this has limited the country s ability to effectively restructure its public debt in a useful way in february 2019 ecuador reached a loan agreement with the imf alongside additional loans from the world bank and other financial institutions information on their terms and conditions is still limited but recent massive layoffs in the public sector could provide a first hint without winning an election the economic elites and their representatives have gradually returned to the levers of state power as moreno has appointed right wing figures to top offices after the elected vice president jorge glas was removed from office and imprisoned on corruption charges based on shaky evidence maria alejandra vicuña became moreno s second vice president vicuña a long term supporter of the citizens revolution a former parliamentarian and a member of the leftist bolivarian alfarist alliance aba a current within alianza país began to denounce alleged corruption within the citizens revolution but was herself forced to step down over corruption allegations she allegedly compelled her office staff in parliament to contribute a fraction of their salaries to her personal bank account which she later declared was to benefit the aba movement in late 2018 radio broadcaster otto sonnenholzner was appointed moreno s third vice president while vicuña whose leftist background did not inspire confidence in economic elites had been elected by a narrow margin sonnenholzner received the support of moreno s alianza país and the main right wing parties the parliamentary faction of the citizens revolution loyal to rafael correa voted against sonnenholzner what s more vicuña s corruption has apparently been used to provide cover for larger scandals such as thousands of unauthorized bank debts for allegedly contracting insurance policies without clients consent or offshore funds allegedly used to furnish moreno s apartment in geneva the latter was the tip of the iceberg of a much wider scandal of bribes and offshore bank accounts surrounding moreno to protect the president ecuadorian institutions have so far blocked demands for an investigation of these events meanwhile moreno s policymaking has severely affected the state s capacity to monitor control and regulate private economic activities after the 2018 referendum the government started to propose and implement neoliberal economic policies more directly namely through moreno s new economic policy adopted in june 2018 its measures include liberalizing foreign trade introducing new tax exemptions creating tax loopholes removing barriers to capital flight into tax havens and implementing austerity measures the law prohibits the central bank from lending to the government and requires public banks and social security to invest in private bonds and equities the law also slashes any leeway in the field of monetary policies despite dollarization an attempt to impose fiscal discipline at the same time the legislation includes an amnesty for billions of unpaid social insurance contributions and tax payments the limits of conservative restoration initially moreno s turn against his predecessor appeared to pay off politically with a spike in approval ratings in his first months in office he was able to rely on a broad alliance of left and right wing critics of correa private media profoundly hostile towards correa boosted his cause scandals media spectacle and a discourse of an oppressive state under correa have enabled moreno to dismantle the citizens revolution and undermined confidence in the public sector meanwhile moreno s assertion that his government inherited a severe economic crisis and a highly indebted country is used to justify economic adjustment for example in late 2018 his administration increased the price of fuel which may be a positive step environmentally in the long run but in the short term will trigger growing discontent among the population and will weaken the purchasing power of ecuadorian consumers as moreno pursues his conservative agenda a growing number of social sectors have begun to distance themselves from the government the government s neoliberal policies have not thus far led to the promised economic success and reflexive attempts to blame problems on correa are losing effectiveness the deterioration of social conditions that we have seen already is a warning that ecuador is in danger of sliding back into the same kind of instability and political crisis that characterized the era before the citizens revolution timm benjamin schützhofer is a political scientist and holds a masters degree in global political economy as part of his recently completed doctoral studies at kassel university he examines the fiscal policy challenges of resource dependent states using ecuador as an example
overview the capital markets are calm ahead of the weekend outside of australia and thailand asia pacific equities advanced while european shares are mostly little changed the regional benchmarks like the s p 500 have recouped last week s losses benchmark 10 year yields are little changed on the day leaving the us 10 year yield virtually unchanged on the week near 2 62 the benchmark japanese government bond yield has hovered around minus five basis points while european bond yields were mostly a little higher except for italy where the yield has eased around three basis points to 2 52 the us dollar is softer against all the major currencies and most of the emerging market currencies the dollar has traded with a heavier bias this week following the disappointing headline job creation reported a week ago asia pacific the bank of japan stuck to its knitting as widely anticipated policy was unchanged the central bank cut its assessment of exports industrial output and foreign growth in line with the recent string of economic data there continued to be two dissents kataoka and harada from a more dovish position while many japanese officials recognize that the 2 inflation target is not realistic there has been so much that has been sacrificed in its name there is a reluctance to abandon it there is also a problem with the credibility of the new target in its own way the boj appears to have stumbled into the fallacy of sunk costs the other problem is that japan is committed to raising the sales tax in october to 10 from 8 even though the government is trying to soften the blow through consumption incentives the economy which contracted in h2 does not have strong growth impulses in the early part of 2019 china s national people s congress session has come to an end premier li reaffirmed cny2 trillion tax cuts will go into effect on april 1 the other significant policy initiative is a new law that ostensibly provides for equal treatment of foreign and domestic firms and bans forced technology transfers what china says its declaratory policy is rarely an issue officials often seem to say the right things it is the operational policy what it does where the proverbial rubber hits the road that is problematic the japanese yen is the only major currency to slip against the us dollar this week it is off a little more than 0 5 with the greenback near jpy111 70 the dollar has traded in a single yen range this week it had begun the week slipping briefly through jpy111 00 and set the week s high just shy of jpy112 00 in early asia where a nearly 400 mln expiring option is struck there are also about 950 mln in options that will also roll off today between jpy111 50 and jpy111 65 three month implied volatility is easing to new five year lows today near 5 6 during the flash crash at the start of the year the implied volatility reached almost 10 the australian dollar is set to snap a three week decline with a gain of around 0 5 0 7080 the aussie has been capped by the 20 day moving average which is found now near 0 7100 for nearly the past three weeks the chinese yuan is little changed this week cny6 714 starting last december the yuan has fallen only one week per month and here in march that was last week when the dollar rose nearly 0 25 europe brexit keeps on giving the next act in the drama is clear there will be another vote on the withdrawal bill early next week if it passes may will seek a three month extension to legislate it however if it does not pass the length of the delay would be left in the eu s hands the withdrawal bill has been defeated resoundingly twice why will the third time be any different this is how the brinkmanship is being played out each time the alternatives are fewer no one likes the withdrawal bill as the historic loss of the first vote demonstrated there has been hope of an alternative but the alternatives continue to get blocked and may s strategy is for those alternatives to be even more unpalatable than the withdrawal bill the stark alternative that the house of commons will face next week is either approve the objectionable withdrawal bill or there could be a potentially long extension that could lead to a reversal of the decision to leave the withdrawal bill is likely to get more support than ever on the third try but it most likely will not pass still the third vote will not deal the last blow there could be one last vote on it after the eu s summit next week but before the end of the month the euro has advanced in five of the six sessions since last week s ecb meeting which saw the euro fall to18 month lows near 1 1175 the high was recorded in the middle of the week near 1 1340 the euro has spent little time subsequently below 1 13 and looks poised to move higher there price action in the north american morning is likely to be hampered by 2 8 bln euros in options in the 1 1310 to 1 1325 area that are set to expire there are also 1 7 bln euros in options struck at 1 13 that will be cut today and another option for 630 mln euros at 1 1285 the euro s three month implied volatility is near 5 55 today which is also a five year low sterling fell 1 5 last week and near 1 3250 it is up about 1 8 this week sterling appears to have been boosted by perceptions that the downside risks of an exit with a deal have been reduced investors seem to be wrestling with the uncertainty caused by a long delay and the possibility that there is a kernel of truth to the scare tactic that a delay will morph into revoking article 50 three month implied volatility is near 10 3 off about 0 25 this week america the s p 500 is up more than 12 year to date the 10 year note yield is lower than it began the year this appears to have removed some sense of urgency from the trump administration for a trade deal with china president trump makes it sound like it is now china that feels the string of urgency but this seems to be a negotiating tactic the latest reports suggest that the potential agreement is already 110 120 pages long it still looks a few weeks away both sides want to host the two president summit trump is scheduled to be in japan in late may the trip could include a meeting with xi trump says there can be no deal until xi and he agree but china wants an agreement before the meeting to avoid the fate of north korea at the last meeting the us

in 2001 the bfa is a nongovernmental nonprofit international organization committed to promoting regional economic integration ahead of the conference zhou xiaochuan vice chairman of the bfa shared his views on the world economic situation and the bfa s role in promoting common development with beijing review reporter wang hairong zhou is also the chief representative of china to the forum and former governor of the people s bank of china beijing review the bfa has become an important platform for promoting globalization and the development of asia and emerging economies can you explain its role zhou xiaochuan the bfa is a high level dialogue platform with unique advantages over the years it has been committed to promoting economic integration in asia as well as globalization which are the focus of its annual meetings taking into consideration the challenges facing the world economy and regional cooperation we set the theme of this year s annual meeting as shared future concerted action common development as an open and inclusive platform for discussion on promoting regional and world economic growth the forum will build consensus on globalization free trade multilateralism and global governance and offer fresh ideas on innovation and structural reform this year s bfa will feature dozens of sub forums which will shed light on the trend of asian and global economies from different perspectives in addition the bfa will release relevant research reports and host thematic activities in collaboration with its partners this year s annual meeting is the first after a new board of directors took office last spring what will be new at the forum in addition to continuing in depth discussions on key areas it has focused on over the years such as economy finance and trade this year s forum will also cover topics such as innovation health culture education and media these issues matter to economic growth and global development some of these topics are interdisciplinary for example bfa chairman ban ki moon proposed a sub forum titled a sustainable future for rural asia and cities which will look at rural vitalization and smart city construction from a future perspective the sub forum will cover areas like urban planning and governance the application of new technologies in the digital age the development of creative industries and the preservation of cities cultural characteristics in addition to the annual meeting the bfa is also actively cooperating with some well known institutions to organize a series of special events for example it initiated a global health forum in 2018 which will debut in qingdao east china s shandong province this june with preparations presently underway the bfa has maintained good cooperation with the media and will soon launch some online and offline projects to promote media exchanges and training in asia in the fields of education science and technology and culture the bfa has introduced and will continue to introduce specific programs to promote dialogue and cooperation in related fields the themes and topics of the bfa annual conference are usually formulated in light of the world and asian economic situation how would you evaluate the current situation since the outbreak of the global financial crisis a decade ago countries have worked together to help the global economy out of the crisis global economic growth returned to pre crisis levels in 2017 a synchronized global economic recovery greeted the start of 2018 but it suffered a series of shocks later in the year global trade frictions escalated the u s federal reserve raised interest rates four times currencies in many emerging economies depreciated sharply oil prices plunged and global stock markets tumbled a very important reason giving rise to these phenomena is that in the decade after the outbreak of the global financial crisis many countries neither carried out enough structural reforms nor properly solved the problems of weak endogenous economic power and social polarization as a result economic globalization became the scapegoat while global populism unilateralism and trade protectionism are on the rise posing challenges to existing international economic trade and financial systems the international monetary fund imf toned down the expected global economic growth rate for 2019 and 2020 to 3 5 and 3 6 percent thus the international community needs to make great efforts to remedy and improve the situation nevertheless despite these changes in the past year the asian economy showed strong resilience and realized overall good performance asia was still the fastest growing region in the world economy contributing more than 60 percent to world economic growth the imf estimated that asia grew at 5 6 percent in 2018 and would grow at 5 4 percent in 2019 despite downturn pressure from external risks high savings and investment rates balanced current accounts sustained investment in human capital and technological innovation and the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep under negotiation will become important forces driving sustainable development in asia in the future what has caused increased instability and uncertainty in world economic development structural problems in various countries coupled with the escalation of global trade frictions tightening financial conditions and increasing fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices in 2018 have led to a deterioration of the external development environment for countries and increased instability and uncertainty in world economic development the escalation of trade frictions has become a major disturbance for the sustainable growth of the global economy since 2018 the u s has imposed tariffs on a variety of imports triggering countermeasures by trading partners and resulting in a tense global trade situation in the third quarter of 2018 the growth rate of new export orders slowed down significantly with the global trade outlook indicator dropping to 100 3 approaching a tipping point between boom and bust increased trade tensions can directly deflate business and market confidence as well as weaken investment and trade increased trade barriers can also increase commodity transaction costs reduce the efficiency of global resource allocation disrupt global supply chains and hinder the dissemination of new technologies thereby reducing productivity in the long run trade tensions could cloud the medium term growth prospects of the global economy the tightening of global financial conditions is a significant external factor affecting the steady growth of emerging market economies after the global financial crisis major countries implemented a long term quantitative easing monetary policy and as a result low cost capital flowed into emerging market economies on a large scale in 2018 as the u s federal reserve hiked interest rates more frequently as the u s dollar strengthened and as the european central bank sent signals to stop quantitative easing global financial conditions gradually tightened exposing emerging market economies to increased financing difficulties and financial market shocks in addition trade frictions and geopolitical risks have created fluctuations in commodity prices exchange rates of emerging market economies such as argentina turkey and south africa fluctuated dramatically greatly affecting the stable development of the domestic economy financial markets in some asian economies with better domestic economic fundamentals have also been affected by spillover effects in addition disruptive technological innovation while promoting leapfrog economic development has also created many difficulties for policymakers artificial intelligence block chains big data cloud computing and other disruptive technologies have spawned a variety of businesses rapidly changed people s way of life and work reconfigured the value system and inspired new products and services however disruptive technological innovation can also be used to evade traditional regulation for example the vigorous development of financial science and technology has brought about such thorny and wide ranging problems as the distortion of market supply and demand caused by high frequency transactions the use of virtual money for illegal transactions the leakage of consumer financial data and cyberattacks on important financial infrastructure which may cause significant risks given unstable and uncertain economic growth prospects how should globalization be promoted and international economic rules improved the international community should adhere to multilateralism work together to promote globalization improve global trade rules and return the world economy to the track of strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth currently it is urgent to reform the world trade organization wto and safeguard the multilateral trading system wto reform cannot be accomplished by one country or one party alone multilateral discussions and consensus are needed to promote it wto members need to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation jointly safeguard free trade actively explore ways to improve trade negotiation frameworks and establish a new global trade order as soon as possible at the same time the international community should continue to reform the international monetary system and build a global financial safety net as the core institution of this safety net the imf needs to ensure sufficient liquidity while also improving the flexibility and pertinence of loan conditions asia europe latin america and brics countries brazil russia india china and south africa are also constantly improving arrangements for providing financial assistance at the regional level since 2008 more than 70 swap agreements have been signed between more than 50 central banks around the world stabilizing market confidence in addition more equitable globalization should be promoted by strengthening infrastructure interconnection according to world bank estimates about 60 percent of the world s economic output comes from coastal areas lying within 100 km from the coastline some countries especially landlocked countries are marginalized in the process of economic globalization which in turn hinders economic globalization meanwhile some experts estimate that the mode of economic globalization characterized by tariff concessions can promote world economic growth by up to 5 percent while the new type of economic globalization driven by interconnectivity can promote world economic growth by 10 15 percent it is for this reason that president xi jinping proposed the belt and road initiative to promote a new type of globalization the initiative has been recognized and supported by more than 100 governments and international organizations and has the broad participation of the private sector across the world what role does asia play in promoting globalization and improving international economic rules faced with the rise of anti globalization sentiment and trade protectionism asian leaders have jointly voiced their firm support for economic globalization and trade and investment facilitation through various platforms and have actively promoted regional integration in may 2018 the leaders of china japan and the republic of korea met and reiterated that they should jointly safeguard free trade and promote regional economic integration the qingdao declaration of the shanghai cooperation organization summit in june pointed out that economic globalization and regional integration are the general current trend so all parties should safeguard the authority and effectiveness of wto rules consolidate an open inclusive transparent non discriminatory and rule based multilateral trading system and oppose any form of trade protectionism in mid november the east asian leaders meetings proposed trade facilitation in east asia should be further strengthened e commerce and the digital economy should be promoted and rcep negotiations covering nearly half of the world s population and nearly one third of its trade volume should be completed as soon as possible as supporters of the multilateral free trade system many share common views on improving trade liberalization and investment facilitation resisting protectionism and unilateralism and addressing climate change at a time when global economic growth is facing bottlenecks and trade rules are being challenged asian countries hope to work with countries in other parts of the world to set up a bridge for restructuring the international trade and economic order formulate and maintain new rules and contribute to the sustainable growth of the world economy currently there are many high level exchange platforms such as the world economic forum and the asia pacific economic cooperation economic leaders meeting moreover china has initiated events including the belt and road forum for international cooperation and the world internet conference what are the unique features of the bfa compared to other platforms how can its competitiveness and attractiveness be maintained some of these platforms are intergovernmental international conferences and some are nongovernmental forums every one of them has its own characteristics and plays a very good role the annual meeting of the bfa covers various aspects of asia emerging markets and the world economy its participants include state leaders government ministers executives of the world s top 500 enterprises and other business leaders as well as opinion leaders it is a top notch feast of ideas in terms of the popularity depth and breadth of its topics for its participants the bfa is willing to strengthen exchanges with other platforms for example it has exchanged observers with the world economic forum and is willing to carry out more win win cooperation with other forums copyedited by rebeca toledo
this article is more than 5 years old getty bank lending is a key to economic growth but what happens to the economy when there s a shift in the kind of loans that banks make and a shift in debt when banks de emphasize lending to companies that produce new goods and services what happens to labor productivity and wage growth when banks become more interested in lending so people can buy stuff that already exists like real estate and stocks what happens since the 1990s the majority of bank credit in advanced economies has gone into buying real estate and financial assets like stocks instead of going to businesses that create new goods and services non financial services that is that s according to a recent working paper credit where it s due a historical theoretical and empirical review of credit guidance policies in the 20th century by dirk bezemer university of groningen netherlands josh ryan collins ucl institute for innovation and public purpose frank van lerven new economics foundation and lu zhang utrecht university netherlands banking systems in industrialised economies have shifted away from their textbook role of providing working capital and investment funds to businesses they have primarily lent against pre existing assets in particular domestic real estate assets looking at 1973 to 2005 the researchers found that financial sector deregulation in advanced economies is significantly associated with a lower share of bank loans going to finance the production of goods and services non financial services chart from credit where it s due globally debt shifted toward financing the purchase of pre existing assets like real estate and stocks and away from financing businesses that produce goods and services credit flowing into goods and service businesses typically leads to investments that lead to increased productivity and wage growth credit flowing into real estate and financial assets typically does not lead to increased productivity in the real economy to the same degree the shift toward relatively less credit going toward productive businesses helps explain slower wage growth and increased income inequality the shift toward relatively more loans going toward pre existing real estate and financial assets helps explain their booms and busts the depth of the great recession and the increase in income inequality in the 1980s and 1990s governments deregulated their banks and reduced their credit guidance policies that steered credit toward certain industries and uses the authors of the paper believe it was this change since the 1980s in how credit is allocated a change made worse by financial innovation like derivatives and the globalization of finance that was at the root of the 2008 great financial crisis backstory from the end of world war ii until the 1980s it was very common for central banks and treasury departments to 1 have credit guidance policies which steered where private sector loans went and 2 have government economic development banks that explicitly lent government money to targeted industries and uses government policies typically encouraged loans to export industries farming and manufacturing while discouraging loans to import industries service housing and personal consumption rebuilding after the war the countries wanted to increase production first in order to increase consumption later the governments felt monetary policies like interest rates were too blunt an instrument to promote economic development they wanted to steer loans toward certain productive industries monetary policy couldn t do that credit policy could table from credit where it s due highlights are mine credit guidance policies from central banks and state owned development banks worked particularly well in asia they were a big part the economic miracles in post war japan korea and taiwan and more recently in china but their effectiveness outside east asia was limited this seems incredibly high but the paper refers to a study that found that globally by the 1970s governments owned 50 of the assets of the largest banks in industrial countries and 70 of the assets of the largest banks in developing countries that began to change in the 1980s distortion of credit allocation in the 1980s the story on central bank credit guidance and state development banks shifted from good to bad at the same time the top priority of central banks had shifted from promoting economic growth to controlling inflation the consensus among economists started to change credit guidance policies began to be seen as distorting the efficient allocation of credit because loans were going to less profitable industries some industries were getting cheap credit while other more profitable industries weren t getting the productive investments they needed it was thought a deregulated banking sector would allocate the money more efficiently and lead to faster economic growth the paper barely mentions it but by the 1980s incompetence and corruption had often become a problem credit guidance often guided loans toward political allies instead of reforming the bureaucracies the consensus was to remove the policies the united states was one of the first countries to start to reduce it s credit guidance policies the u s government was hugely involved in private sector credit in the 1980s the policy paper refers to a study that found between 1980 and 1990 in the u s a third of all net credit issued to non federal sectors was either directly provided subsidized or guaranteed by federal credit programmes a washington consensus formed in the 1980s as the u s imf and world bank all agreed that central banks and treasuries should de emphasize policies that directed credit to particular types of businesses financial industry deregulation became a strong global trend what happened next so what happened as banks were deregulated around the world did lending become more efficient as credit guidance was reduced a main thesis of the paper is that the 1980s and 1990s financial deregulation gave banks more freedom to determine where to lend money and they chose to lend a lot more money to people to buy things that already existed like houses but only a little bit more money to businesses to invest in making things or providing services chart from credit where it s due the thesis of the working paper is that when given a choice lenders often prefer to make mortgage loans because of the collateral the interest rate is certainly lower on mortgages than on business loans but with mortgages lenders get great collateral the house itself overall mortgages are much quicker easier and safer for lenders to make than business loans they also make the argument that when lenders decide for whatever reason to lend more money to buy houses house prices will increase because houses have such inelastic supply the idea here is that when house prices increase foreclosures decrease let me expand on that if house prices have increased and you lose your job and can t pay the mortgage you re a lot more likely to be able to just sell the house and make money instead of getting foreclosed on when one huge lender or enough small lenders want to make more mortgage loans and to do that they all lower their lending standards a tad bit at the same time it increases the amount of money chasing houses so house prices increase inelastic supply and the number of loans that go bad will be lower than previously expected at least for those buyers who bought before the house prices increased given the lower than expected percentage of defaults the lenders lower their lending standards another notch and the cycle repeats itself until eventually years later house prices stop increasing and defaults unexpectedly increase i d say the lenders may have convinced themselves they were making mortgage loans but mostly they were speculating on house prices rising the result of this feedback loop is much higher levels of household debt which in the long run can lower household spending on the goods and services that are being produced today and that are creating jobs today that in turn lowers wage growth globally debt shifted from investments in producing future goods and services toward investments in buying things that were already produced the debt shift increased income inequality two different ways first lower relative investment in businesses that produce goods and services helps explain the wage stagnation second the higher relative investment in existing assets raised asset prices which benefited those who owned more assets higher income households for example stock buybacks finally i think the current controversy over corporate stock buybacks is a perfect example of how the debt shift theory works until 1982 it was illegal for u s companies to buy back their own stock this restriction could be considered to be a credit guidance policy in recent years without that credit guidance policy many companies are borrowing money at historically low interest rates not to invest in capital equipment and increased productivity but to buy back their own stock it s far easier to increase the price of your company s stock by borrowing money to simply buy some of your company s own stock than it is to go through all the time and work needed to borrow money and invest it in increasing your company s productivity the stock price may increase in either case but the national economy grows in one scenario but not the other other possible debt shift explanations the paper certainly does not say that the de emphasis on credit guidance from central banks was the only reason for the debt shift here are a couple of reasons that come to my mind effect of partial deregulation despite the financial deregulation of the 1980s and 1990s the u s government for example continued to have large credit programs subsidies guarantees or direct programs particularly for house purchases and agriculture keeping the credit guidance policies for housing while deregulating other parts of finance could have been a big factor in steering money toward real estate lending falling interest rates from the 1980 s into the 2010s falling interest rates likely also played a role i would have expected that lower interest rates would spur all investment equally but it may be that lower rates naturally favor some investments like real estate and financial asset investments over others like riskier but more productive investments nevertheless the experience of japan suggests credit guidance from central banks is the most important factor richard werner s book princes of the yen details how after decades of economic miracles a massive real estate bubble appeared in japan in the 1980s right after japan changed it credit guidance policy called window guidance to encourage more lending including encouraging more lending to real estate summary the debt shift theory isn t about a shift in who made the loans or who received the loans but about a shift in what loans were used for the debt shift theory says the removal of central bank credit guidance policies in the 1980s and 1990s led to a large shift in lending toward pre existing assets which lead to a large shift in debt toward real estate and financial asset purchases the shift in debt had impacts on real estate and financial asset prices price instability expenditures on goods and services labor productivity wage growth income inequality and was the root cause of the great financial crisis

corporation s drilling services decreased by 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 this was partially offset by the new snubbing revenue provided by the powerstroke acquisition consolidated revenue decreased 7 to 47 8 million in the quarter from 51 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in consolidated revenue combined with the decreased contribution from the drilling services segment which has a high operating margin resulted in adjusted ebitda decreasing to 6 6 million in the quarter from 12 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 flat contribution from the international business segment with an increase in share based compensation expense as well as reduced foreign exchange gain resulted in a decrease in net earnings to 2 3 million 0 04 per share basic in the quarter versus 3 5 million 0 06 per share basic in the fourth quarter of 2017 year to date 2018 increased activity from high arctic s well servicing segment was insufficient to offset the decrease in drilling activity in png and lower canadian nitrogen and snubbing activity resulting in a 3 decrease in revenue to 203 3 million in 2018 versus 210 2 million in 2017 adjusted ebitda decreased 6 7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 the decline is due to a reduction in revenue combined with a greater proportion of revenue contribution from lower margin production services compared to 2017 the corporation generated 11 4 million 0 22 per share basic in net earnings in 2018 versus 20 3 million 0 38 per share basic in 2017 a total of 10 3 million was returned to

rigs rigs 115 and 116 and operates two rigs rigs 103 and 104 on behalf of a major oil and gas exploration company in png in the fourth quarter of 2017 high arctic added a fast moving land based rig rig 405 to its png drilling fleet to complete a short term drilling project due to the duration of this project the rig was leased from a non png third party contractor following damage to the well site from the earthquake in february 2018 the customer decided to terminate operations and rig 405 was returned to australia during the third quarter of 2018 fourth quarter drilling services revenue decreased 16 in the quarter to 20 8 million from 24 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to lower drilling activity in the quarter rig 103 continued operations at ist 3 until december 12 and then mobilized to idt 21 for its next well rig 104 spud its well at muruk 2 in early november and continued drilling through year end rig 115 and rig 116 were cold stacked during the quarter with rig 116 completing its take or pay contract in early november year to date 2018 consistent with the fourth quarter results lower drilling activity combined with reduced contribution from take or pay contracted revenue from both rig 115 and rig 116 has contributed to a 12 decline in drilling services revenue to 93 0 million in 2018 versus 105 1 million generated in 2017 the lower drilling activity in 2018 is a result of the major earthquake in the first quarter and resultant delays in drilling programs compared to the same period in 2017 when rig 115 was under take or pay until june rig 116 was on standby for the full period and rig 104 was actively drilling operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 40 in 2018 versus 41 in 2017 production

workover services in png through rig 102 the net book value of rig 102 is not material and no workover services were provided in png during 2017 or 2018 and as such no revenue was generated or costs have been incurred associated with this rig during the periods presented fourth quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 2 increase in revenue for the production services segment to 21 4 million in the quarter versus 20 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating hours for the concord rigs decreased 5 to 27 161 hours in the quarter from 28 509 hours in the fourth quarter of 2017 consistent with prior quarters the concord rigs achieved above industry utilization of 51 versus the 37 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to increase to 616 per hour in the quarter from 611 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2017 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 5 9 million in the quarter versus the 3 4 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 792 versus 2 344 hours in the fourth quarter of 2017 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers operating margin decreased 24 to 0 compared to the same quarter in 2017 the decrease in margin is primarily due to start up costs amounting to 2 million incurred in the quarter related to expansion into the us as part of the powerstroke acquisition and other associated operating costs year to date 2018 the production services segment revenue increased to 84 9 million in 2018 from 81 0 million in 2017 year to date the concord rigs have generated 117 395 operating hours for a 56 utilization of the corporation s 58 average caodc registered service rigs versus 57 utilization

per hour in 2017 activity for the corporation s snubbing rigs has declined 3 in 2018 versus 2017 this decline in activity was due to the corporation s core snubbing customers directing their efforts towards completing fracturing programs during the period operating margin decreased to 11 6 million in 2018 from 16 2 million in 2017 operating margins as a percentage of revenue decreased to 14 in 2018 from 20 in 2017 the primary factor contributing to this decrease is lower field operating margins in the snubbing segment during the fourth quarter the corporation sold its blackfalds facility

of high arctic s oilfield rental equipment in canada and png as well as its canadian nitrogen and clearcompliance software business operations fourth quarter growth in the segment s png rental operations was offset by decreases in canadian rental operations nitrogen services and engineering activity during the quarter the increase in png rental activity was due to an increase in equipment being utilized in support of drilling activity particularly for the remote exploration and appraisal work operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 69 in the quarter versus 50 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was due to the increased contribution from the png rental division partially offset by a decline in the operating margin from the nitrogen services division compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 year to date 2018 increased rentals associated with both higher activity for the corporation s concord well servicing and higher equipment rental activity in png offset lower nitrogen services and engineering in 2018 the higher equipment rental activity was due to increased drilling activity experienced in 2018 versus 2017 as well as increased rentals in png associated with recovery work after the february earthquake operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 66 in 2018 from 58 in 2017 higher margin rental divisions in png and canada made up

the year depreciation was flat share based compensation the increase in share based compensation to 1 4 million in 2018 from 0 5 million from 0 7 million in 2017 is a result of a higher number of

higher deferred tax recovery in 2018 other comprehensive income as discussed above under foreign exchange transactions the corporation recorded a 12 0 million foreign currency translation gain in

measures on page 11 as at december 31 2018 the corporation had nil outstanding on its debt facilities and 31 5 million in cash the bank of png policy continues to encourage the use of the local market currency kina due to high arctic s requirement to transact with international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past operating activities the increase in foreign exchange losses and deferred tax expense offset by the increase in net working capital changes has resulted in funds provided from operations to increase 23 to 42 1 million from 34 3 million year on year 2017 to 2018 investing activities year to date the corporation has invested an additional 13 6 million 2017 3 2 million in capital expenditures primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs and the purchase of saddle well services and the powerstroke group of companies financing activities during the year the corporation distributed 10 3 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 2 473 862 shares for a total of 9 6 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 19 9 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facility as at december 31 2018 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at december 31 2018 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the fourth quarter was significantly muted due to low domestic oil prices caused from the surplus of oil production in western canada relative to the takeaway capacity caused by pipeline constraints requiring the intervention by the alberta government to introduce apportionment of oil production in the province the uncertainties this has created within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added the wide differential pricing for canadian crude oil caused many operators to voluntarily shut in production followed by regulated apportionment introduced by the alberta government has resulted in a decrease of well servicing activity canadian oil and gas companies are being very cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs high arctic recognizes the unique challenges faced by the industry and our clients and will continue to focus on providing the highest quality of service delivered with industry leading safety standards at fair and reasonable prices activity for the corporation s concord well servicing operations continues to show strength with year to date operating hours for the concord service rigs approximately 6 above the hours generated in the same period in 2017 this increase in hours demonstrates the strength of high arctic s customer base and exposure to certain operating areas where high arctic service rigs are particularly suited to the working environment similar to prior quarters attraction and retention of sufficient field staff to meet demand continues to remain an industry challenge and has resulted in the corporation implementing various compensation initiatives in an effort to attract and retain staff the compensation programs introduced throughout 2018 have resulted in markedly reduced field staff turnover rates and have improved high arctic s ability to respond to activity demands while retaining high arctic s strong safety and operational performance as seen in the third and fourth quarter results these compensation programs have added additional costs to the corporation s canadian operations however management believes this investment in enhanced field compensation plans is a net positive to the operating results while activity levels for the corporation s well servicing operations remain strong low natural gas prices and oil price differentials continue to hamper activity for the corporation s snubbing and n2 operations we expect market conditions in canada to remain challenging for both organic growth and consolidation opportunities the acquisition of powerstroke has opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states and management looks forward to exploring growth opportunities high arctic continues to pursue opportunities to move under utilized assets in canada to redeploy into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made by prime minister peter o neil that a memorandum of understanding was signed setting key terms and conditions for a gas agreement with the papua lng project consortium and indicating a fully termed lng gas agreement may be signed by the end of march 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png later in 2019 following the three year contract renewal in q3 in png rigs 103 and 104 remained active through the quarter rig 103 completed its operations at the ist3 well site and moved to the idt21 well site in mid december and subsequent to year end rig 103 completed preliminary works on the idt21 well and walked over to iht1 well on the same drilling pad and conducted works rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 completed its move and rig up at the muruk 2 appraisal well site and was drilling at year end rig 104 is currently conducting works in the muruk 2 well bore to assist our customer and their partners with obtaining well and reservoir technical data rig 104 will continue working on muruk 2 with possible additional delineation works to be undertaken before commencing work to fly the rig and associated equipment off the well site the take or pay contract for rig 116 expired on november 2 and the rig is currently stacked in port moresby rig 115 was demobilised during the third quarter and is also cold stacked in port moresby both rig 115 and 116 are being offered for services both within

corporation s drilling services decreased by 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 this was partially offset by the new snubbing revenue provided by the powerstroke acquisition consolidated revenue decreased 7 to 47 8 million in the quarter from 51 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in consolidated revenue combined with the decreased contribution from the drilling services segment which has a high operating margin resulted in adjusted ebitda decreasing to 6 6 million in the quarter from 12 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 flat contribution from the international business segment with an increase in share based compensation expense as well as reduced foreign exchange gain resulted in a decrease in net earnings to 2 3 million 0 04 per share basic in the quarter versus 3 5 million 0 06 per share basic in the fourth quarter of 2017 year to date 2018 increased activity from high arctic s well servicing segment was insufficient to offset the decrease in drilling activity in png and lower canadian nitrogen and snubbing activity resulting in a 3 decrease in revenue to 203 3 million in 2018 versus 210 2 million in 2017 adjusted ebitda decreased 6 7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 the decline is due to a reduction in revenue combined with a greater proportion of revenue contribution from lower margin production services compared to 2017 the corporation generated 11 4 million 0 22 per share basic in net earnings in 2018 versus 20 3 million 0 38 per share basic in 2017 a total of 10 3 million was returned to shareholders in 2018 through dividends which represents 28 of funds provided from operations in 2018 the corporation purchased and cancelled 2 473 862 shares for a total of 9 6 million under the

rig 405 to its png drilling fleet to complete a short term drilling project due to the duration of this project the rig was leased from a non png third party contractor following damage to the well site from the earthquake in february 2018 the customer decided to terminate operations and rig 405 was returned to australia during the third quarter of 2018 fourth quarter drilling services revenue decreased 16 in the quarter to 20 8 million from 24 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to lower drilling activity in the quarter rig 103 continued operations at ist 3 until december 12 and then mobilized to idt 21 for its next well rig 104 spud its well at muruk 2 in early november and continued drilling through year end rig 115 and rig 116 were cold stacked during the quarter with rig 116 completing its take or pay contract in early november year to date 2018 consistent with the fourth quarter results lower drilling activity combined with reduced contribution from take or pay contracted revenue from both rig 115 and rig 116 has contributed to a 12 decline in drilling services revenue to 93 0 million in 2018 versus 105 1 million generated in 2017 the lower drilling activity in 2018 is a result of the major earthquake in the first quarter and resultant delays in drilling programs compared to the same period in 2017 when rig 115 was under take or pay until june rig 116 was on standby for the full period and rig 104 was actively drilling operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 40 in 2018 versus 41 in 2017 production

arctic s fleet of well servicing rigs operating as concord well servicing and its fleet of stand alone and rig assist snubbing units the production services segment also provides heli portable workover services in png through rig 102 the net book value of rig 102 is not material and no workover services were provided in png during 2017 or 2018 and as such no revenue was generated or costs have been incurred associated with this rig during the periods presented fourth quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 2 increase in revenue for the production services segment to 21 4 million in the quarter versus 20 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating hours for the concord rigs decreased 5 to 27 161 hours in the quarter from 28 509 hours in the fourth quarter of 2017 consistent with prior quarters the concord rigs achieved above industry utilization of 51 versus the 37 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to increase to 616 per hour in the quarter from 611 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2017 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 5 9 million in the quarter versus the 3 4 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 792 versus 2 344 hours in the fourth quarter of 2017 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers operating margin decreased 24 to 0 compared to the same quarter in 2017 the decrease in margin is primarily due to start up costs amounting to 2 million incurred in the quarter related to expansion into the us as part of the powerstroke acquisition and other associated operating costs year to date 2018 the production services segment revenue increased to 84 9 million in 2018 from 81 0 million in 2017 year to date the concord rigs have generated 117 395 operating hours for a 56 utilization of the corporation s 58 average caodc registered service rigs versus 57 utilization achieved in 2017 for the industry s registered service rig fleet source caodc in 2018 the concord rigs have generated an average revenue rate of 616 per hour compared to an average revenue rate of 596 per hour in 2017 activity for the corporation s snubbing rigs has declined 3 in 2018 versus 2017 this decline in activity was due to the corporation s core snubbing customers directing their efforts towards completing fracturing programs during the period operating margin decreased to 11 6 million in 2018 from 16 2 million in 2017 operating margins as a percentage of revenue decreased to 14 in 2018 from 20 in 2017 the primary factor contributing to this decrease is lower field operating margins in the snubbing segment during the fourth quarter the corporation sold its blackfalds facility

of high arctic s oilfield rental equipment in canada and png as well as its canadian nitrogen and clearcompliance software business operations fourth quarter growth in the segment s png rental operations was offset by decreases in canadian rental operations nitrogen services and engineering activity during the quarter the increase in png rental activity was due to an increase in equipment being utilized in support of drilling activity particularly for the remote exploration and appraisal work operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 69 in the quarter versus 50 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was due to the increased contribution from the png rental division partially offset by a decline in the operating margin from the nitrogen services division compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 year to date 2018 increased rentals associated with both higher activity for the corporation s concord well servicing and higher equipment rental activity in png offset lower nitrogen services and engineering in 2018 the higher equipment rental activity was due to increased drilling activity experienced in 2018 versus 2017 as well as increased rentals in png associated with recovery work after the february earthquake operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 66 in 2018 from 58 in 2017 higher margin rental divisions in png and canada made up

depreciation depreciation expense decreased slightly to 6 4 million in the quarter from 6 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the corporation incurred a full quarter of depreciation associated with the 13 3 million in operating assets added through completion of the powerstroke and saddle well services acquisitions that added 12 1 million and 1 2 million respectively of operating assets for the year depreciation was flat share based compensation the increase in share based compensation to 1 4 million in 2018 from 0 5 million from 0 7 million in 2017 is a result of a higher number of awards granted foreign exchange transactions the corporation has exposure to the u s dollar and other currencies such as the png kina through its international operations as a result the corporation is exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses through the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions as well as the conversion of the corporation s u s dollar based subsidiaries into canadian dollars for financial reporting purposes gains and losses recorded by the canadian parent on its u s denominated cash accounts receivables payables and intercompany balances are recognised as a foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of earnings high arctic is further exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through its net investment in foreign subsidiaries the value of these net investments will increase or decrease based on fluctuations in the u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar these gains and losses are unrealized until such time that high arctic divests its investment in a foreign subsidiary and are recorded in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation gains or losses for foreign operations the u s dollar remained strong relative to the canadian dollar as it increased during the third quarter compared to the first half of 2018 with an average exchange rate of 1 3214 during the fourth quarter of 2018 2017 1 2715 the stronger u s

higher deferred tax recovery in 2018 other comprehensive income as discussed above under foreign exchange transactions the corporation recorded a 12 0 million foreign currency translation gain in

currency kina due to high arctic s requirement to transact with international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past operating activities the increase in foreign exchange losses and deferred tax expense offset by the increase in net working capital changes has resulted in funds provided from operations to

expenditures primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs and the purchase of saddle well services and the powerstroke group of companies financing activities during the year the corporation distributed 10 3 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 2 473 862 shares for a total of 9 6 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 19 9 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facility as at december 31 2018 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at december 31 2018 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the fourth quarter was significantly muted due to low domestic oil prices caused from the surplus of oil production in western canada relative to the takeaway capacity caused by pipeline constraints requiring the intervention by the alberta government to introduce apportionment of oil production in the province the uncertainties this has created within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added the wide differential pricing for canadian crude oil caused many operators to voluntarily shut in production followed by regulated apportionment introduced by the alberta government has resulted in a decrease of well servicing activity canadian oil and gas companies are being very cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs high arctic recognizes the unique challenges faced by the industry and our clients and will continue to focus on providing the highest quality of service delivered with industry leading safety standards at fair and reasonable prices activity for the corporation s concord well servicing operations continues to show strength with year to date operating hours for the concord service rigs approximately 6 above the hours generated in the same period in 2017 this increase in hours demonstrates the strength of high arctic s customer base and exposure to certain operating areas where high arctic service rigs are particularly suited to the working environment similar to prior quarters attraction and retention of sufficient field staff to meet demand continues to remain an industry challenge and has resulted in the corporation implementing various compensation initiatives in an effort to attract and retain staff the compensation programs introduced throughout 2018 have resulted in markedly reduced field staff turnover rates and have improved high arctic s ability to respond to activity demands while retaining high arctic s strong safety and operational performance as seen in the third and fourth quarter results these compensation programs have added additional costs to the corporation s canadian operations however management believes this investment in enhanced field compensation plans is a net positive to the operating results while activity levels for the corporation s well servicing operations remain strong low natural gas prices and oil price differentials continue to hamper activity for the corporation s snubbing and n2 operations we expect market conditions in canada to remain challenging for both organic growth and consolidation opportunities the acquisition of powerstroke has opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states and management looks forward to exploring growth opportunities high arctic continues to pursue opportunities to move under utilized assets in canada to redeploy into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made by prime minister peter o neil that a memorandum of understanding was signed setting key terms and conditions for a gas agreement with the papua lng project consortium and indicating a fully termed lng gas agreement may be signed by the end of march 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png later in 2019 following the three year contract renewal in q3 in png rigs 103 and 104 remained active through the quarter rig 103 completed its operations at the ist3 well site and moved to the idt21 well site in mid december and subsequent to year end rig 103 completed preliminary works on the idt21 well and walked over to iht1 well on the same drilling pad and conducted works rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 completed its move and rig up at the muruk 2 appraisal well site and was drilling at year end rig 104 is currently conducting works in the muruk 2 well bore to assist our customer and their partners with obtaining well and reservoir technical data rig 104 will continue working on muruk 2 with possible additional delineation works to be undertaken before commencing work to fly the rig and associated equipment off the well site the take or pay contract for rig 116 expired on november 2 and the rig is currently stacked in port moresby rig 115 was demobilised during the third quarter and is also cold stacked in port moresby both rig 115 and 116 are being offered for services both within

in calculating the net earnings loss per share and adjusted net earnings loss per share amounts is determined as explained in note 17 of the financial statements fourth quarter activity for the corporation s drilling services decreased by 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 this was partially offset by the new snubbing revenue provided by the powerstroke acquisition consolidated revenue decreased 7 to 47 8 million in the quarter from 51 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in consolidated revenue combined with the decreased contribution from the drilling services segment which has a high operating margin resulted in adjusted ebitda decreasing to 6 6 million in the quarter from 12 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 flat contribution from the international business segment with an increase in share based compensation expense as well as reduced foreign exchange gain resulted in a decrease in net earnings to 2 3 million 0 04 per share basic in the quarter versus 3 5 million 0 06 per share basic in the fourth quarter of 2017 year to date 2018 increased activity from high arctic s well servicing segment was insufficient to offset the decrease in drilling activity in png and lower canadian nitrogen and snubbing activity resulting in a 3 decrease in revenue to 203 3 million in 2018 versus 210 2 million in 2017 adjusted ebitda decreased 6 7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 the decline is due to a reduction in revenue combined with a greater proportion of revenue contribution from lower margin production services compared to 2017 the corporation generated 11 4 million 0 22 per share basic in net earnings in 2018 versus 20 3 million 0 38 per share basic in 2017 a total of 10 3 million was returned to

rigs rigs 115 and 116 and operates two rigs rigs 103 and 104 on behalf of a major oil and gas exploration company in png in the fourth quarter of 2017 high arctic added a fast moving land based rig rig 405 to its png drilling fleet to complete a short term drilling project due to the duration of this project the rig was leased from a non png third party contractor following damage to the well site from the earthquake in february 2018 the customer decided to terminate operations and rig 405 was returned to australia during the third quarter of 2018 fourth quarter drilling services revenue decreased 16 in the quarter to 20 8 million from 24 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to lower drilling activity in the quarter rig 103 continued operations at ist 3 until december 12 and then mobilized to idt 21 for its next well rig 104 spud its well at muruk 2 in early november and continued drilling through year end rig 115 and rig 116 were cold stacked during the quarter with rig 116 completing its take or pay contract in early november year to date 2018 consistent with the fourth quarter results lower drilling activity combined with reduced contribution from take or pay contracted revenue from both rig 115 and rig 116 has contributed to a 12 decline in drilling services revenue to 93 0 million in 2018 versus 105 1 million generated in 2017 the lower drilling activity in 2018 is a result of the major earthquake in the first quarter and resultant delays in drilling programs compared to the same period in 2017 when rig 115 was under take or pay until june rig 116 was on standby for the full period and rig 104 was actively drilling operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to 40 in 2018 versus 41 in 2017 production

arctic s fleet of well servicing rigs operating as concord well servicing and its fleet of stand alone and rig assist snubbing units the production services segment also provides heli portable workover services in png through rig 102 the net book value of rig 102 is not material and no workover services were provided in png during 2017 or 2018 and as such no revenue was generated or costs have been incurred associated with this rig during the periods presented fourth quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 2 increase in revenue for the production services segment to 21 4 million in the quarter versus 20 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating hours for the concord rigs decreased 5 to 27 161 hours in the quarter from 28 509 hours in the fourth quarter of 2017 consistent with prior quarters the concord rigs achieved above industry utilization of 51 versus the 37 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to increase to 616 per hour in the quarter from 611 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2017 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 5 9 million in the quarter versus the 3 4 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 792 versus 2 344 hours in the fourth quarter of 2017 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers operating margin decreased 24 to 0 compared to the same quarter in 2017 the decrease in margin is primarily due to start up costs amounting to 2 million incurred in the quarter related to expansion into the us as part of the powerstroke acquisition and other associated operating costs year to date 2018 the production services segment revenue increased to 84 9 million in 2018 from 81 0 million in 2017 year to date the concord rigs have generated 117 395 operating hours for a 56 utilization of the corporation s 58 average caodc registered service rigs versus 57 utilization achieved in 2017 for the industry s registered service rig fleet source caodc in 2018 the concord rigs have generated an average revenue rate of 616 per hour compared to an average revenue rate of 596 per hour in 2017 activity for the corporation s snubbing rigs has declined 3 in 2018 versus 2017 this decline in activity was due to the corporation s core snubbing customers directing their efforts towards completing fracturing programs during the period operating margin decreased to 11 6 million in 2018 from 16 2 million in 2017 operating margins as a percentage of revenue decreased to 14 in 2018 from 20 in 2017 the primary factor contributing to this decrease is lower field operating margins in the snubbing segment during the fourth quarter the corporation sold its blackfalds facility

of high arctic s oilfield rental equipment in canada and png as well as its canadian nitrogen and clearcompliance software business operations fourth quarter growth in the segment s png rental operations was offset by decreases in canadian rental operations nitrogen services and engineering activity during the quarter the increase in png rental activity was due to an increase in equipment being utilized in support of drilling activity particularly for the remote exploration and appraisal work operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 69 in the quarter versus 50 in the fourth quarter of 2017 this increase was due to the increased contribution from the png rental division partially offset by a decline in the operating margin from the nitrogen services division compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 year to date 2018 increased rentals associated with both higher activity for the corporation s concord well servicing and higher equipment rental activity in png offset lower nitrogen services and engineering in 2018 the higher equipment rental activity was due to increased drilling activity experienced in 2018 versus 2017 as well as increased rentals in png associated with recovery work after the february earthquake operating margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 66 in 2018 from 58 in 2017 higher margin rental divisions in png and canada made up a greater proportion of revenue in 2018 which helped offset the decline in operating margin from the nitrogen services division general and administration three months ended december 31 year ended

investments will increase or decrease based on fluctuations in the u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar these gains and losses are unrealized until such time that high arctic divests its investment in a foreign subsidiary and are recorded in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation gains or losses for foreign operations the u s dollar remained strong relative to the canadian dollar as it increased during the third quarter compared to the first half of 2018 with an average exchange rate of 1 3214 during the fourth quarter of 2018 2017 1 2715 the stronger u s

december 31 2017 this strengthening of the u s dollar has resulted in a translation gain of 12 0 million recorded in other comprehensive income for the year ended december 31 2018 7 1 million gain for

higher deferred tax recovery in 2018 other comprehensive income as discussed above under foreign exchange transactions the corporation recorded a 12 0 million foreign currency translation gain in

currency kina due to high arctic s requirement to transact with international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past operating activities the increase in foreign exchange losses and deferred tax expense offset by the increase in net working capital changes has resulted in funds provided from operations to increase 23 to 42 1 million from 34 3 million year on year 2017 to 2018 investing activities year to date the corporation has invested an additional 13 6 million 2017 3 2 million in capital expenditures primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs and the purchase of saddle well services and the powerstroke group of companies financing activities during the year the corporation distributed 10 3 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 2 473 862 shares for a total of 9 6 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 19 9 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facility as at december 31 2018 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at december 31 2018 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the fourth quarter was significantly muted due to low domestic oil prices caused from the surplus of oil production in western canada relative to the takeaway capacity caused by pipeline constraints requiring the intervention by the alberta government to introduce apportionment of oil production in the province the uncertainties this has created within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added the wide differential pricing for canadian crude oil caused many operators to voluntarily shut in production followed by regulated apportionment introduced by the alberta government has resulted in a decrease of well servicing activity canadian oil and gas companies are being very cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs high arctic recognizes the unique challenges faced by the industry and our clients and will continue to focus on providing the highest quality of service delivered with industry leading safety standards at fair and reasonable prices activity for the corporation s concord well servicing operations continues to show strength with year to date operating hours for the concord service rigs approximately 6 above the hours generated in the same period in 2017 this increase in hours demonstrates the strength of high arctic s customer base and exposure to certain operating areas where high arctic service rigs are particularly suited to the working environment similar to prior quarters attraction and retention of sufficient field staff to meet demand continues to remain an industry challenge and has resulted in the corporation implementing various compensation initiatives in an effort to attract and retain staff the compensation programs introduced throughout 2018 have resulted in markedly reduced field staff turnover rates and have improved high arctic s ability to respond to activity demands while retaining high arctic s strong safety and operational performance as seen in the third and fourth quarter results these compensation programs have added additional costs to the corporation s canadian operations however management believes this investment in enhanced field compensation plans is a net positive to the operating results while activity levels for the corporation s well servicing operations remain strong low natural gas prices and oil price differentials continue to hamper activity for the corporation s snubbing and n2 operations we expect market conditions in canada to remain challenging for both organic growth and consolidation opportunities the acquisition of powerstroke has opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states and management looks forward to exploring growth opportunities high arctic continues to pursue opportunities to move under utilized assets in canada to redeploy into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made by prime minister peter o neil that a memorandum of understanding was signed setting key terms and conditions for a gas agreement with the papua lng project consortium and indicating a fully termed lng gas agreement may be signed by the end of march 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png later in 2019 following the three year contract renewal in q3 in png rigs 103 and 104 remained active through the quarter rig 103 completed its operations at the ist3 well site and moved to the idt21 well site in mid december and subsequent to year end rig 103 completed preliminary works on the idt21 well and walked over to iht1 well on the same drilling pad and conducted works rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 completed its move and rig up at the muruk 2 appraisal well site and was drilling at year end rig 104 is currently conducting works in the muruk 2 well bore to assist our customer and their partners with obtaining well and reservoir technical data rig 104 will continue working on muruk 2 with possible additional delineation works to be undertaken before commencing work to fly the rig and associated equipment off the well site the take or pay contract for rig 116 expired on november 2 and the rig is currently stacked in port moresby rig 115 was demobilised during the third quarter and is also cold stacked in port moresby both rig 115 and 116 are being offered for services both within

a cyclist passes by construction cranes in xi an china a starting point of the new silk road zhang peng lightrocket via getty images china s belt and road initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure investment effort in history but is it also a plan to remake the global balance of power by andrew chatzky research staff council on foreign relations by james mcbride deputy director council on foreign relations in 2013 chinese president xi jinping announced the launch of both the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road infrastructure development and investment initiatives that would stretch from east asia to europe the project eventually termed the belt and road initiative bri but sometimes known as the new silk road is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects ever conceived it harkens back to the original silk road which connected europe to asia centuries ago enriching traders from the atlantic to the pacific some analysts see the project as an unsettling extension of china s rising power and as the costs of many of the proposed projects have skyrocketed opposition has grown in some participant countries meanwhile the united states shares the concern of some in asia that the bri could be a trojan horse for china led regional development military expansion and beijing controlled institutions under president donald j trump washington has raised alarm over beijing s actions even as it has abandoned some u s efforts to isolate china and deepen its own ties with economic partners in the region what was the original silk road the silk road came into being during the westward expansion of china s han dynasty 206 bce 220 ce which forged trade networks throughout what are today the central asian countries of afghanistan kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan as well as modern day india and pakistan to the south those routes extended more than four thousand miles to europe central asia was thus the epicenter of one of the first waves of globalization connecting eastern and western markets spurring immense wealth and intermixing cultural and religious traditions valuable chinese silk spices jade and other goods moved west while china received gold and other precious metals ivory and glass products use of the route peaked during the first millennium under the leadership of first the roman and then byzantine empires and the tang dynasty 618 907 ce in china but the crusades as well as advances by the mongols in central asia dampened trade and today central asian countries are economically isolated from each other with intra regional trade making up just 6 2 percent of all cross border commerce they are also heavily dependent on russia particularly for remittances they make up one third of the gross domestic product gdp of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan by 2018 remittances had dipped from their 2013 highs due to russia s economic woes what are china s plans for its new silk road president xi announced the initiative during official visits to kazakhstan and indonesia in 2013 the plan was two pronged the overland silk road economic belt and the maritime silk road the two were collectively referred to first as the one belt one road initiative but eventually became the belt and road initiative xi s vision included creating a vast network of railways energy pipelines highways and streamlined border crossings both westward through the mountainous former soviet republics and southward to pakistan india and the rest of southeast asia such a network would expand the international use of chinese currency the renminbi while new infrastructure could break the bottleneck in asian connectivity according to xi the asian development bank estimates that the region faces a yearly infrastructure financing shortfall of nearly 800 billion in addition to physical infrastructure china plans to build fifty special economic zones modeled after the shenzhen special economic zone which china launched in 1980 during its economic reforms under leader deng xiaoping xi subsequently announced plans for the 21st century maritime silk road at the 2013 summit of the association of southeast asian nations asean in indonesia to accommodate expanding maritime trade traffic china would invest in port development along the indian ocean from southeast asia all the way to east africa china s overall ambition for the bri is staggering to date more than sixty countries accounting for two thirds of the world s population have signed on to projects or indicated an interest in doing so analysts estimate the largest so far to be the 68 billion china pakistan economic corridor a collection of projects connecting china to pakistan s gwadar port on the arabian sea in total china has already spent an estimated 200 billion on such efforts morgan stanley has predicted china s overall expenses over the life of the bri could reach 1 2 1 3 trillion by 2027 though estimates on total investments vary what does china hope to achieve china has both geopolitical and economic motivations behind the initiative xi has promoted a vision of a more assertive china while the new normal of slowing growth has put pressure on the country s leadership to open new markets for its consumer goods and excess industrial capacity experts see the bri as one of the main planks of chinese statecraft under xi alongside the made in china 2025 economic development strategy for xi the bri serves as pushback against the much touted u s pivot to asia as well as a way for china to develop new investment opportunities cultivate export markets and boost chinese incomes and domestic consumption in this sense xi s aggressive approach is a shift away from his predecessors who followed deng s maxim hide your strength bide your time cfr s elizabeth c economy writes under xi china now actively seeks to shape international norms and institutions and forcefully asserts its presence on the global stage nayan chanda former editor of the far eastern economic review calls the bri an overt expression of china s power ambitions in the 21st century arguing that beijing s goal is to remake the global geopolitical balance of power others frame it in less adversarial terms saying the chinese leadership simply hopes the bri will improve china s image among its neighbors and help to rejuvenate them economically for some the bri is a chinese response to a renewed u s focus on asia launched by the obama administration in 2011 many in beijing read this as an effort to contain china by expanding u s economic ties in southeast asia in a 2015 speech retired chinese general qiao liang described the bri as a hedge strategy against the eastward move of the us at the same time china was motivated to boost global economic links to its western regions which historically have been neglected promoting economic development in the western province of xinjiang where separatist violence has been on the upswing is a major priority as is securing long term energy supplies from central asia and the middle east especially via routes the u s military cannot disrupt more broadly chinese leaders are determined to restructure the economy to avoid the so called middle income trap in this scenario which has plagued close to 90 percent of middle income countries since 1960 wages go up and quality of life improves as low skilled manufacturing rises but countries struggle to then shift to producing higher value goods and services zhang yunling of the chinese academy of social sciences a state backed think tank argues that the bri will offer new import and export options creating new production chains that will spur the development of the chinese economy what are the potential roadblocks ahead while several developing countries in need of new roads railways ports and other infrastructure have welcomed bri investments the initiative has also stoked opposition for some countries that take on large amounts of debt to fund the necessary infrastructure bri money is seen as a potential poisoned chalice bri projects are built with low interest loans as opposed to aid grants explain cfr s alyssa ayres and elizabeth c economy and johns hopkins s daniel markey some bri investments have required the use of chinese firms and their bidding processes have lacked transparency as a result contractors have inflated costs leading to canceled projects and political pushback examples of such criticisms abound in sri lanka president maithripala sirisena sought to renegotiate colombo s repayment schedule but china asked for a long lease on a major port in return for debt forgiveness some reports indicate sri lanka owed 13 billion on its debt in 2018 with expected total government revenues of just 14 billion in malaysia mahathir bin mohamad elected prime minister in 2018 campaigned against overpriced bri initiatives which he claimed were partially re directed to funds controlled by his predecessor once in office he canceled 22 billion worth of bri projects the new maldivian government has also begun to unwind some of the bri projects introduced under former president abdulla yameen abdul gayoom while the china pakistan economic corridor is at risk as islamabad faces a balance of payments crisis in 2018 as debts to china began to weigh on its economy pakistan sought billions of dollars in loans from saudi arabia the international monetary fund and china more such stories are likely according to a report by the center for global development which notes that eight bri countries are vulnerable to debt crises five of the eight border china and two more djibouti and the maldives are choke points on the maritime silk road arguments against the bri have in some cases helped propel politicians across the region into office christopher balding a former professor at the hsbc business school in shenzhen says that the bri s no strings approach has counterintuitively made some of its investments less attractive the approach has fueled corruption while allowing governments to burden their countries with unpayable debts he says political backlash is perhaps less of a concern in authoritarian countries taking part in the bri where autocrats face less public scrutiny and where the chinese model of governance might hold more appeal but some governments in places such as kenya and zambia are carefully studying bri investments before they sign up and candidates in malaysia have explicitly run and won campaigns on anti bri platforms how has the united states responded to china led regional integration the united states has shared other countries concerns about china s perceived intentions at the 2018 asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit u s vice president mike pence told regional leaders that the united states doesn t offer a constricting belt or a one way road developing the economies of south and central asia is a longstanding u s goal that intensified after the start of the u s war in afghanistan and president barack obama s pivot to asia the obama administration frequently referenced the need for the afghan economy to move past foreign assistance and in 2014 then deputy secretary of state william burns committed the united states to returning central and south asia to its historic role as a vital hub of global commerce ideas and culture in this spirit the obama administration supported a 10 billion gas pipelinethrough turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan and india it also spent billions of dollars on roads and energy projects in afghanistan and used its diplomatic muscle to help craft new regional cooperation frameworks to foster central asian economic links the trump administration has pursued a more confrontational strategy in the region some analysts have called on the united states to respond by deepening its own ties with asian partners as the obama administration tried to do with the trans pacific partnership a deal rejected by trump in favor of seeking to strengthen relationships on a bilateral basis the trump administration with bipartisan support in congress has instead tried to counter the bri with the build act this consolidated the overseas private investment corporation opic a u s government agency for development finance with components of the u s agency for international development usaid into a separate agency with a 60 billion investment portfolio although this pales in comparison to the more than 1 trillion that financial analysts expect china to spend on the bri advocates say it seeks to crowd in a larger pool of private investment by underwriting risk some have argued that the united states might find a silver lining in the bri jonathan e hillman of the center for strategic and international studies says the united states could use bri projects as a way to have china pay for infrastructure initiatives in central asia that are also in the u s interest what is the role for third countries other countries have sought to balance their concerns about china s ambitions against the benefits that the bri promises india india has tried to convince local countries that the bri is a plan to dominate asia warning of what some analysts have called a string of pearls geoeconomic strategy whereby china creates unsustainable debt burdens for its indian ocean neighbors and potentially takes control of regional choke points policymakers in new delhi have long been unsettled by china s decades long embrace of traditional rival pakistan and since the george w bush administration u s leaders have seen india as a regional balancer against a china dominated asia the trump administration s 2017 indo pacific strategy framed india as a counterweight to china s repressive vision of the world order based on economic inducements and penalties influence operations and implied military threats india has provided its own development assistance to neighbors most notably afghanistan where it has spent 3 billion on infrastructure projects including the parliament building roads hospitals and dams yet despite u s misgivings india was a founding member of china s asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and indian and chinese leaders have invested in developing closer diplomatic ties india does a lot with china in the multilateral arena for its own reasons says ayres japan tokyo has maintained a similar strategy balancing increasing interest in regional infrastructure development with longstanding suspicions about china s intentions in 2016 japan committed to spending 110 billion on infrastructure projects throughout asia japan has with india also agreed to develop the asia africa growth corridor aagc a plan to develop and connect ports from myanmar to east africa europe some european countries are torn between traditional ties to the united states and the economic opportunities that the bri presents several countries in central and eastern europe have accepted bri financing for their own infrastructure shortfalls french president emmanuel macron has urged prudence suggesting during a trip to china that the bri could make partner countries vassal states russia moscow has become one of the bri s most enthusiastic partners though it responded to xi s announcement at first with reticence worried that beijing s plans would outshine moscow s vision for a eurasian economic union and impinge on its traditional sphere of influence as russia s relationship with the west has deteriorated however president vladimir putin has pledged to link up his eurasian vision with the bri some experts are skeptical of such an alliance which they argue would be economically asymmetrical russia s economy and its total trade volume are both roughly one eighth the size of china s a gulf that the bri could widen in the coming years originally

this week s big interview is truly big i enjoyed the privilege of chatting one on one with dr stephen leeb stephen leeb ph d is the chief investment strategist of the complete investor and real world investing dr leeb s books have been notable for predicting the secular bull market that started in the 1980s getting in on the ground floor putnam 1986 the tech stock crash and rise of real assets including oil and gold defying the market profiting in the turbulent post technology market boom mcgraw hill 1999 and the surge in oil prices the oil factor protect yourself and profit from the coming energy crisis warner books 2004 i first started working with dr leeb way back in 1990 that s him with manhattan in the background let s see what he has to say about the present and future of the investment world q you ve written several prescient books about the emergence of china as an economic rival to america in which areas does china pose the greatest threat to america and how should investors position themselves a the greatest threat to the u s from china s emergence will be commodity scarcities they will have the potential to drive down economic growth and apply pressure to stock markets scarcities are just beginning to show up now but i expect they will intensify over time one investment implication will be rising gold prices as i will explain i would recommend that for now investors have around a 10 weighting in precious metals and especially gold and a somewhat smaller weighting in major diversified commodity stocks as commodity scarcities become more visible i d switch the entire commodities weighting into gold for the rest of an investor s portfolio my theme is garp or growth at a reasonable price while there s a widespread assumption that this long lived economic expansion is due to end i think that for as long as commodity scarcities remain relatively modest growth has further to go garp means sticking with a mix of stocks with low forward price to earnings ratios p es and prospects for decent growth what s your take on the u s china trade war do tariffs actually work and if in your view they don t what are more effective ways for the u s to counter china s allegedly unfair trade practices tariffs don t work with countries that are relatively equal meaning ones where each has economic advantages and disadvantages which is the case today with the u s and china by contrast in 1987 the u s used tariffs successfully against japan largely dictating a new trading relationship between the two countries but japan s gross domestic product gdp was 60 to 70 smaller than ours today based on some measures such as international dollars the measure used by both the international monetary fund imf and world bank china s economy is bigger than ours on the other hand because china exports much more to us than we export to china we have more chinese goods on which to place tariffs but this has proved a pyrrhic victory because as reported in early march by several think tanks u s consumers are bearing the entire cost of the tariffs to the tune of around 3 billion a month and that doesn t count the extra costs of relocating supply chains increasing tariffs further will only add to the burden on american consumers while china s economy has slowed it s not clear how big a role the tariffs played the chinese have been deleveraging which has been a factor in slowing growth but even if you attribute the entire slowdown in china s economy to u s tariffs china s gdp is still growing three times faster than ours many economic historians blame the smoot hawley tariff act of 1930 for exacerbating the worldwide depression that paved the way for wwii today any full fledged trade war would be lose lose and possibly catastrophic the u s is far more vulnerable than many realize because of our dependence on other countries and especially china for many critical commodities including rare earths cobalt and graphite these are essential in every high tech product from computers to electric vehicles to advanced military equipment china could wreak major damage to our economy by placing exorbitant tariffs on these materials a far better way to confront the challenge china clearly poses to our position in the world would be to treat today as a sputnik moment when the soviet union shocked us in 1957 by launching the first unmanned satellite undermining our belief in our technological superiority we didn t respond with tariffs rather we launched an all out effort to catch up and surpass the russians by spending billions of dollars on science technology engineering and math stem education and research in little more than a decade we established a hegemony in technology that lasted 50 years we need to make a comparable all out effort today to invest in education and infrastructure that would ensure our economy can compete as the century proceeds what is your view of gold prices in 2019 and beyond is the yellow metal poised for resurgence and if so why i believe gold will be entering a bull market likely to dwarf anything seen before one reason is my expectation that gold will be at the heart of a new monetary system that china has long been intent on midwifing a window into china s intentions comes from comments made in 2009 by the then head of china s central bank who trenchantly summarized the risks to global economic stability when a sovereign currency such as the dollar is the world s reserve currency an analysis many western economists would agree with in its place he proposed a reserve currency modeled on special drawing rights sdrs administered by the imf he said such a basket of currencies should be backed by an asset that he did not name but that clearly referred to gold i believe that in coming years such a system will become reality and it will propel gold far higher that s because the quantity of gold in the world is limited all the gold ever mined is less than 200 000 metric tonnes and with a lot of that used for jewelry the amount available for monetary purposes has a current value of about 3 5 trillion assuming that monetary gold is used only to back up international transactions gold prices would have to climb more than 10 fold to accommodate trade that means a long term target for gold would likely be north of 10 000 ounce and maybe higher and shares in gold mining companies could rise even more dramatically especially those with major undeveloped mines with massive deposits some of them in geopolitically safe america in the gold bull market that lasted from mid 1976 to early 1981 some gold mining stocks rose 50 fold and more i expect the coming bull market in gold to last longer and rise much further is inflation only modest or are price pressures worse than investors realize both compared to historical averages inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi is indeed moderate but this conceals the reality that for the majority of americans price pressures are historically high this conclusion is based on a recent study i did that compared two periods over the past 32 years 1987 to 2002 and 2002 to present in the first period inflation as measured by the cpi averaged about 3 3 in the second it was 2 1 yet it was in the latter period when inflation supposedly was lower that living standards markedly worsened for americans in the bottom 50 of the income distribution line among other significant signs of being forced to make do with less they are consuming less protein and buying more used cars i see that as a sign that inflation in the second period has been more insidious than appears on the surface insight into this comes from a surprising contrast in the behavior of commodity prices in the earlier period a broad measure of commodity prices fell by over 20 in the more recent period the same measure of commodities more than doubled keeping up with the s p 500 making it one of the best periods ever for commodities as we enter the third decade of this century it s accurate to say most commodities are in uptrends that date from 1975 there is no other 50 year period in which such a broad swath of commodities has been climbing together higher commodity prices obviously should relate to inflation and in particular they translate into higher prices for essential goods such as foods while such essentials constitute a fairly small part of the cpi they have been accounting for an ever growing portion of spending by lower income americans looking ahead it s significant that for the first time at least in modern times fast growing emerging countries which are huge consumers of commodities to fuel economic growth now constitute the biggest portion of the global economy this means commodities of all sorts will be growing scarcer and more expensive almost surely making life harder than ever for lower income americans and widening the gap between haves and have nots and returning to the previous question about gold an investment implication of higher commodity prices is that even if i m wrong about a new monetary reserve system gold prices will be sharply uptrended what is the single most underrated threat to investors this year i think most investors have become complacent in regards to energy assuming that oil prices will stay low while the world is indeed well supplied with oil today it would not take a lot to change that dynamic if opec agrees to a deep production curb if u s producers hit unexpected snags if there s an out of the blue major terrorist attack or outbreak of conflict in a sensitive region any of these could impact supply and send oil prices up sudden spikes in oil prices tend to wreak havoc on economies and portend rough times for the stock market few people expect a big jump in oil this year making it a potential negative surprise that could blindside the market for that reason i believe it s very important to keep a close eye on the oil market

operations were able to better serve the completion activity in the wcsb in 2018 sand volumes increased by 35 sand revenue increased by 50 and total sales revenue increased by 43 when compared with 2017 sand pricing improved by 11 due to contractual increases and the flow through of increased logistics costs during the year wellsite solutions revenue increased by 12 4 million or 22 in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to a 38 increase in trucking revenues associated with the increased sand volumes and increased sahara rental revenue sahara rental revenue increased as the fleet of

31 2018 gross margin and adjusted gross margin increased by 17 4 million and 25 7 million respectively when compared to the year ended december 31 2017 primarily due to a 35 increase in sand volumes gross margin was 26 95 per mt and adjusted gross margin was 34 87 per mt for the year ended december 31 2018 sand volumes in the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased by 184 192 mt or 33 compared to the sand volumes sold in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to decreased activity in the wcsb resulting from an unpredictable operating environment very wide western canadian oil and condensate differentials and e p companies conservatively managing their remaining 2018 capital budgets in the fourth quarter of 2018 north american wide pipeline egress issues and the growth of domestic sand supply in the permian also led to lower mine gate sales in the us in the fourth quarter of 2018 source s sand revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 by 18 5 million or 29 compared to the fourth quarter of

decreased by 54 3 million or 54 when compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 49 decrease in sand volumes 357 744 mt and a 11 decrease 14 73 per mt in the average realized sand price primarily due to an extreme slow down in activity levels in the wcsb average realized sand prices also fell due to declines in spot pricing consistent with decreased activity levels and a change in sales mix as customers under contract had largely completed their 2018 capital programs during the fourth quarter of 2018 revenue from wellsite solutions decreased by 3 0 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a 51 decrease in sahara related revenues from decreased activity in the wcsb which resulted in a 37 utilization of sahara units and a 13 decrease in trucking activity associated with the decreased sand sales volumes wellsite solutions revenue also decreased by 14 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to a 44 decrease in sahara related revenue and a 72 decrease in trucking activity associated with the decreased wcsb activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 gross margin decreased by 9 9 million and adjusted gross margin decreased by 10 7 million when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 during the same period gross margin per mt decreased by 14 51 per mt and adjusted gross margin per mt decreased by 12 97 per mt primarily due to the impact of step fixed cost elements of production and fixed rail car lease costs being spread over lower sales volumes adjusted gross margin was 18 64 per mt in the fourth quarter of 2018 including a 5 33 per mt impact from mine gate sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda was 3 2 million which was 16 3 million lower than the 13 1 million of adjusted ebitda generated in the same period in 2017 the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 14 8 million which was 13 7 million lower than the 1 1 million of net loss from the same period in

2017 for the fourth quarter of 2018 source had cash flows provided by operating activities of 26 6 million compared to cash flows used by operating activities of 25 5 million for the same period in

increased significantly from the fourth quarter of 2018 based on booked jobs source is expecting its first quarter 2019 activity levels to be in line with its activity levels in the first quarter of 2018 source appreciates customer capital programs and therefore demand for frac sand could be impacted by several factors including timing of spring break up in the wcsb commodity price fluctuations and condensate demand in the wcsb as e p companies continue to shift into manufacturing mode the trend towards direct sourcing continues and source is pleased to be working directly with five e p customers under contracts these sales are in addition to sales to other e p companies that wish to direct source sand on a less formal basis as well as traditional sales to pressure pumping customers as we enter 2019 source s capital structure is well positioned to provide us flexibility to succeed during all stages of the cycle and we remain committed to ensuring that our capital expenditures in 2019 are funded from cash flows provided by operating activities beyond 2019 we are excited by the industry prospects with improved egress and the longer term impacts of increased demand for liquefied natural gas lng on wcsb activity levels in addition source deployed its first two sahara units to the marcellus these units represent an important step for source as we diversify our revenue streams

overview the capital markets were calm ahead of the weekend outside of australia and thailand asia pacific equities advanced while european shares were mostly little changed the regional benchmarks like the have recouped last week s losses benchmark 10 year yields were little changed leaving the yield virtually unchanged on the week near 2 62 the benchmark japanese government bond yield has hovered around minus five basis points while european bond yields were mostly a little higher except for italy where the yield has eased around three basis points to 2 52 the is softer against all the major currencies and most of the emerging market currencies the dollar has traded with a heavier bias this week following the disappointing headline reported a week ago asia pacific the bank of japan stuck to its knitting as widely anticipated the central bank cut its assessment of exports industrial output and foreign growth in line with the recent string of economic data there continued to be two dissents kataoka and harada from a more dovish position while many japanese officials recognize that the 2 inflation target is not realistic there has been so much that has been sacrificed in its name there is a reluctance to abandon it there is also a problem with the credibility of the new target in its own way the boj appears to have stumbled into the fallacy of sunk costs the other problem is that japan is committed to raising the sales tax in october to 10 from 8 even though the government is trying to soften the blow through consumption incentives the economy which contracted in h2 does not have strong growth impulses in the early part of 2019 china s national people s congress session has come to an end premier li reaffirmed cny2 trillion tax cuts will go into effect on april 1 the other significant policy initiative is a new law that ostensibly provides for equal treatment of foreign and domestic firms and bans forced technology transfers what china says its declaratory policy is rarely an issue officials often seem to say the right things it is the operational policy what it does where the proverbial rubber hits the road that is problematic the is the only major currency to slip against the us dollar this week it is off a little more than 0 5 with the greenback near jpy111 70 the dollar has traded in a single yen range this week it had begun the week slipping briefly through jpy111 00 and set the week s high just shy of jpy112 00 in early asia where a nearly 400 mln expiring option is struck there are also about 950 mln in options that will also roll off today between jpy111 50 and jpy111 65 three month implied volatility is easing to new five year lows today near 5 6 during the flash crash at the start of the year the implied volatility reached

weeks the is little changed this week cny6 714 starting last december the yuan has fallen only one week per month and here in march that was last week when the dollar rose nearly 0 25 europe brexit keeps on giving the next act in the drama is clear there will be another vote on the withdrawal bill early next week if it passes may will seek a three month extension to legislate it however if it does not pass the length of the delay would be left in the eu s hands the withdrawal bill has been defeated resoundingly twice why will the third time be any different this is how the brinkmanship is being played out each time the alternatives are fewer no one likes the withdrawal bill as the historic loss of the first vote demonstrated there has been hope of an alternative but the alternatives continue to get blocked and may s strategy is for those alternatives to be even more unpalatable than the withdrawal bill the stark alternative that the house of commons will face next week is either approve the objectionable withdrawal bill or there could be a potentially long extension that could lead to a reversal of the decision to leave the withdrawal bill is likely to get more support than ever on the third try but it most likely will not pass still the third vote will not deal the last blow there could be one last vote on it after the eu s summit next week but before the end of the month the has advanced in five of the six sessions since last week s ecb meeting which saw the euro fall to18 month lows near 1 1175 the high was recorded in the middle of the week near 1 1340 the euro has spent little time subsequently below 1 13 and looks poised to move higher there price action in the north american morning is likely to be hampered by 2 8 bln euros in options in the 1 1310 to 1 1325 area that are set to expire there are also 1 7 bln euros in options struck at 1 13 that will be cut today and another option for 630 mln euros at 1 1285 the euro s three month implied volatility is near 5 55 today which is also a five year low sterling fell 1 5 last week and near 1 3250 it is up about 1 8 this week sterling appears to have been boosted by perceptions that the downside risks of an exit with a deal have been reduced investors seem to be wrestling with the uncertainty caused by a long delay and the possibility that there is a kernel of truth to the scare tactic that a delay will morph into revoking article 50 three month implied volatility is near 10 3 off about 0 25 this week america the s p 500 is up more than 12 year to date the 10 year note yield is lower than it began the year this appears to have removed some sense of urgency from the trump administration for a trade deal with china president trump makes it sound like it is now china that feels the string of urgency but this seems to be a negotiating tactic the latest reports suggest that the potential agreement is already 110 120 pages long it still looks a few weeks away both sides want to host the two president summit trump is scheduled to be in japan in late may the trip could include a meeting with xi trump says there can be no deal until xi and he agree but china wants an

chinese premier li keqiang speaks at a news conference following the closing session of the national people s congress npc at the great hall of the people in beijing china march 15 2019 reuters jason lee by ryan woo and kevin yao beijing reuters the chinese government has additional monetary policy measures that it can take to support economic growth this year and will even cut its own flesh to help finance large scale tax cuts premier li keqiang said on friday china has promised billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs as economic momentum is expected to cool further due to softer domestic demand and the trade war with the united states li s comments suggest beijing is ready to roll out more stimulus measures to ensure the economy grows within a targeted range of 6 0 to 6 5 percent gross domestic product grew 6 6 percent in 2018 the least in 28 years shares on chinese stock exchanges climbed after the government reaffirmed its commitment to boosting growth the yuan recovered from a three week low against the dollar after li s comments of course we are faced with many uncertain factors this year we have to prepare more and we have reserved policy room to address uncertainties li told a news conference after the annual parliament meeting ended moreover we can deploy quantity based or price based policy tools such as reserve requirements and interest rates this is not monetary easing but to more effectively support the real economy the support measures rolled out so far are taking time to kick in and most analysts believe activity may not convincingly stabilize until the middle of the year the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr five times over the past year with a two stage rrr cut in january releasing a total of 1 5 trillion yuan 223 23 billion into the financial system further cuts in rrr had been widely expected this year after fresh data pointed to persistently soft demand in the asian economic giant raising fears of a sharper slowdown sources told reuters in february that the central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy but is likely to cut market based rates story continues the premier said the government would take multiple measures to lower funding costs for small and micro firms by 1 percentage point this year an across the board cut in borrowing costs could also risk another flare up in debt and speculative activity like that in the wake of the 2008 9 global financial crisis cutting taxes slitting wrists to help finance the tax cuts the government would need to tighten its belt li said china will bolster its national coffers by collecting more of the profits earned by some financial institutions and centrally owned firms while general expenditure will be cut li said that will collectively cover 1 trillion yuan of the government s planned tax cuts he said large scale tax cuts and fee reductions would affect the government cutting its own flesh li said this kind of reform is equivalent to turning one s blade inward and slitting one s wrist promised cuts in value added tax vat for manufacturing and other sectors will take effect from april 1 while social security fees will be reduced from may 1 li said the premier announced on march 5 that the vat for the manufacturing sector would be cut to 13 percent from 16 percent vat for the transport and construction sectors will be reduced to 9 percent from 10 percent li s comments reconfirm a consistent pro growth stance with clarity on fiscal easing and an earlier than expected effective date for tax cuts morgan stanley said in a note adding that it expects improved growth from the second quarter beijing s tax cut efforts have focused on the manufacturing sector and small businesses that are vital for economic growth and employment li said the government hopes to create 13 million jobs this year the same as last year not allowing the economy to slip out of a reasonable range that is to say we will not allow waves of layoffs said li adding the government will provide support to firms creating the most jobs data on thursday showed that china s survey based jobless rate rose to 5 3 percent in february from 4 9 percent in december partly due to job shedding by export oriented companies trade war china is still negotiating with the united states to resolve their trade frictions li said adding both sides have far more shared interests than conflicts and it would be unrealistic to decouple the world s two largest economies we hope that the consultations will be fruitful and will achieve mutual benefit and win win i believe that this is also the expectation of the world li said a summit to seal a trade deal between u s president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will not happen at the end of march as previously discussed treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday washington and beijing have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle as u s presses china for an end to practices and policies it argues have given chinese firms unfair advantages including subsidizing of industry limits on access for foreign companies and alleged theft of intellectual property on friday china s parliament approved a new foreign investment law that promises to create a transparent environment for foreign firms though there is scepticism about its enforceability the law designed to ease concerns among foreign companies about the difficulties they face in china will ban forced technology transfer and illegal government interference in foreign business practices li stressed that china did not and would never ask chinese companies to spy on other countries his comments came after increased international scrutiny of chinese telecommunications giant huawei technologies co ltd which has been caught in the cross fire as trade tensions ratcheted up reporting by ryan woo and

mitch epstein sikkema jenkins co amos coal power plant raymond city west virginia 2004 photograph by mitch epstein from his american power series kingsmill bond certainly sounds like a proper name for a city of london financial analyst he looks the part too gray hair expertly trimmed well cut suit he s lived in moscow and hong kong and worked for deutsche bank the russian financial firm troika dialog and citibank he s currently new energy strategist for a small british think tank called carbon tracker and last fall he published a short paper called 2020 vision why you should see the fossil fuel peak coming it asks an interesting question at what point does a new technology cause an existing industry to start losing significant value this may turn out to be the most important economic and political question of the first half of this century and the answer might tell us much about our chances of getting through the climate crisis without completely destroying the planet based on earlier technological transitions horses to cars sails to steam land lines to cell phones it seems possible that the fossil fuel industry may begin to weaken much sooner than you d think the british venezuelan scholar carlota perez has observed that over a period of twenty years trains made redundant a four thousand mile network of canals and dredged rivers across the uk the canal builders fought hard and even finished a couple of major canals in the 1830s but defeat was inevitable as it later was for american railroads and horses when they were replaced by trucks and cars major technological transitions often take a while the czech canadian academic vaclav smil has pointed out that although james watt developed the coal powered steam engine in 1776 coal supplied less than 5 percent of the planet s energy until 1840 and it didn t reach 50 percent until 1900 but the economic effect of those transitions can happen much earlier bond writes as soon as it becomes clear to investors that a new technology is accounting for all the growth in a particular sector over the last decade there has been a staggering fall in the price of solar and wind power and of the lithium ion batteries used to store energy this has led to rapid expansion of these technologies even though they are still used much less than fossil fuels in 2017 for instance sun and wind produced just 6 percent of the world s electric supply but they made up 45 percent of the growth in supply and the cost of sun and wind power continues to fall by about 20 percent with each doubling of capacity bond s analysis suggests that in the next few years they will represent all the growth we will then reach peak use of fossil fuels not because we re running out of them but because renewables will have become so cheap that anyone needing a new energy supply will likely turn to solar or wind power bond writes that in the 2020s probably the early 2020s the demand for fossil fuels will stop growing the turning point in such transitions is typically the moment when the impact is felt in financial markets when stock prices tumble and never recover who is going to invest in an industry that is clearly destined to shrink though we ll still be using lots of oil its price should fall if it has to compete with the price of sunshine hence the huge investments in pipelines and tankers and undersea exploration will be increasingly unrecoverable precisely how long it will take is impossible to predict but the outcome seems clear this transition is already obvious in the coal markets to understand for example why peabody the world s largest private sector coal mining company went from being on fortune s list of most admired companies in 2008 to bankrupt in 2016 consider its difficulties in expanding its market india until very recently was expected to provide much of the growth for coal as late as 2015 its coal use was expected to triple by 2030 the country was resisting global efforts like the paris accords to rein in its carbon emissions but the price of renewable energy began to fall precipitously and because india suffered from dire air pollution but has inexhaustible supplies of sunlight its use of solar power started to increase dramatically in 2017 the price in india of wind and solar power dropped 50 percent to 35 40 a megawatt hour said tim buckley who analyzes australasia south asia for the institute for energy economics and financial analysis fifty percent in one year and a zero inflation indexation for the next twenty five years just amazing this price drop occurred not because india subsidizes renewable energy it doesn t but because engineers did such a good job of making solar panels more efficient the cost of power from a newly built coal plant using indian coal is by comparison about 60 a megawatt hour if you have to import the coal the price of power is 70 megawatt hour and solar s 40 megawatt hour price is guaranteed not to rise over the thirty year life of the contract the suppliers sign their bids are based on building and then running a facility for the life of the contract no wonder that over the first nine months of 2018 india installed forty times more capacity for renewable than for coal fired power advertisement much the same is happening around the world president trump has spared no effort to help the coal industry but more coal fired power plants shut down during the first two years of his presidency than during president obama s entire first term american coal consumption fell 4 percent in 2018 in 2017 kentucky s coal mining museum installed solar panels on its roof in order to save 10 000 a year on electric costs and it s not just coal that s on the way out natural gas was supposed to be the planet s next big fuel source since it produces less carbon than coal although its production releases great clouds of methane another potent greenhouse gas while fracking has produced high volumes of natural gas especially in the us where it was pioneered wells tend to dry out quickly and despite enormous investment the international energy agency estimates that between 2010 and 2014 the shale industry operated with negative cash flows of more than 200 billion even cheap natural gas is now starting to look expensive compared to the combination of sun wind and batteries in an essay for vox the energy reporter david roberts listed all the natural gas plants many of them designed to provide quick bursts of peaking power on heavy demand days whose planned construction has been canceled in recent months as utilities and banks began to figure out that over the projected forty year life of a new plant there was a good chance it would become an uncompetitive stranded asset producing pointlessly expensive electricity the chief executive of one us solar company said in january i can beat a gas peaker anywhere in the country today with a solar plus storage power plant who in their right mind today would build a new gas peaker we are a factor of two cheaper you get some sense of the future from the stunning fall of general electric they were the world leader the thought leader the finance leader the it leader said buckley and their share price is down 70 percent in the last two and a half years in a market that s up 50 percent it s a thermal power reliant basket case that s in large measure because manufacturing turbines for coal and gas fired power plants was a significant part of the company s business in 2015 it hugely expanded that capacity by buying its largest european competitor alstom but then the bottom dropped out of the industry as proposed new generating plants couldn t find financing ge makes wind turbines too but that s a lower margin business with many more competitors the fall in ge s stock has meant hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value reduction according to buckley last june after more than a century general electric was dropped from the dow industrial index replaced by a drugstore chain oil was believed to be better protected than coal and gas from competition because cars have long needed liquid fuel to run but electric cars are becoming affordable for more and more consumers in 2017 only three million out of a worldwide total of 800 million cars were electric but they accounted for 22 percent of the growth in global car sales the world s leading car companies have become convinced that electric vehicles will account for all the growth in demand by the early 2020s that s why by january 2018 they had committed 90 billion to developing electric vehicles and why by 2017 tesla was worth more than gm or ford and for every tesla that rolls off the assembly line chinese manufacturers are producing five electric cars auto analysts are already warning consumers to think twice before buying a gas powered car since its resale value may fall dramatically over just the next three years the oil companies tell investors not to worry in mid february exxon announced that it had found huge new deepwater oil deposits off the coast of guyana and that overall it planned to pump 25 percent more oil and gas in 2025 than it had in 2017 which it claimed would triple its profits in september opec released a report predicting higher oil demand due to increases in jet travel and the production of plastics which are made from petrochemicals analysts like bond are skeptical of such claims although oil has been the planet s most important industry for over a century over the last five years it s been the slowest growing sector of the stock market petrochemicals and jet fuel are indeed harder to replace with renewable energy but they make up a relatively small part of the market for oil even if demand for them grows it can t offset the losses in core uses like pumping gas for cars advertisement the recent history of european utilities may provide a more realistic preview of what will happen in the rest of the world in the early years of this century the german government increased the pace of decarbonization subsidizing solar and wind energy as more and cheaper renewable supplies became available the existing utilities were slow to react they had built new gas plants to account for what they assumed would be rising demand but solar and wind cut into that demand and the price of electricity began to fall so far european utilities have written down about 150 billion in stranded assets fossil fuel installations that are no longer needed in the netherlands by the time the last three coal plants were turned on their owners had already written them down by 70 percent said buckley and they re scheduled to close by 2030 one obvious question is why the fossil fuel companies don t simply transform themselves into renewable energy companies and use the huge cash flows they still have to gain control of future markets they re putting under ten percent of capital expenditures into renewables says bond which translates into about one percent of their balance sheets as exxon s ceo recently told the economist we have much higher expectations for the returns on the capital we invest than sun and wind can provide from their point of view there s some money to be made from putting up solar panels but once they re on the roof the sunshine is free for corporations that made vast profits by selling their customers fuel every day for a century that s not an attractive business model another important question is whether this transition will crash the world economy investors have money at risk and not just in fossil fuel shares a shift of this size will affect car companies machinery companies and many others but as the climate activist and billionaire investor tom steyer has pointed out most technological transitions damage existing industries without wrecking the economy because they create value even as they destroy it look at the communications industry over the last two decades as the internet came of age steyer said some of the most valuable businesses on the planet that had been around for more than a century got decimated i mean newsweek sold for a dollar but a lot of new businesses got created that were worth more and banks have had at least some warning to prepare for this enormous shift in 2015 mark carney the governor of the bank of england began issuing strident warnings about stranded fossil fuel assets urging the banks he regulated to begin taking close account of their exposure he gave a memorable speech on the trading floor of lloyds of london pointing out that if countries made serious efforts to meet climate targets vast amounts of money spent on oil wells pipelines coal mines and tankers would be written off he had to issue the warnings he said because the normal time horizon for financiers was too short once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability it may already be too late he said noting that the exposure of uk investors including insurance companies to these shifts is potentially huge he urged them to start preparing for a lower carbon world companies he said should disclose not only what they are emitting today but how they plan their transition to the net zero world of the future carney s warning which reverberated out from the financial center of london seems to have spurred a reevaluation of fossil fuel exposure by many big financial institutions the major banks are now addressing this risk whereas three years ago they were asleep to it buckley said now in australia all our banks have climate policy where they didn t three years ago we didn t even have data a report in late february from the institute for energy economics and financial analysis showed that since 2013 a hundred major banks had restricted coal lending or gotten out of the business altogether 1 robert rauschenberg earth day 1970 from the exhibition nature s nation american art and environment on view at the peabody essex museum salem massachusetts through may 5 the catalog is published by the princeton university art museum which organized the exhibition a far more important question of course is whether the changes now underway will happen fast enough to alter our grim climatic future here the answers are less positive scientists conservative by nature have routinely underestimated the pace of planetary disruption the enormous melt now observed at the poles was not supposed to happen until late in the century for instance and the galloping pace of ocean acidification wasn t even recognized as a threat two decades ago that means that we have very little time to act not enough certainly for business cycles to do the job alone the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change released last autumn laid out a strict timeline we need to effectively halve our use of fossil fuels within a dozen years to prevent the worst damage which is why activists and politicians have called for dramatic government interventions like the green new deal recently proposed by representative alexandria ocasio cortez and her democratic colleagues 2 government action is required because for one thing there s vast inertia in the energy system plants are built to last decades and even if plants that use fossil fuels aren t built today banks will insist that existing ones operate long enough to pay back their investments and in some parts of the world fossil fuel expansion continues china for instance is trying to close down its own coal fired power plants because its cities are choked in smog but chinese companies are using their expertise to build coal powered plants abroad buckley noted that the opportunities for bribes on colossal projects mean among other things that a number of developing countries may indeed continue down the fossil fuel path in countries like the us or canada the political power of the fossil fuel industry is still considerable barack obama boasted to a texas audience last year that during his administration the us had passed russia and saudi arabia as the biggest producer of hydrocarbons even the progressive canadian prime minister justin trudeau recently spent billions in tax dollars to finance a pipeline designed to increase exports from the country s environmentally ruinous tar sands that s why the most important aspect of the decline of fossil fuel companies might be a corresponding decline in their political influence the coal oil and gas industries have been the architects of the disinformation campaigns that kept us from responding earlier to scientists warnings about climate change and they are using every trick they know to keep us from making a quick transition history indicates that the oil majors and those who invest in them will bribe and fund trump type candidates and use their money in any other way to slow down change carlota perez said but change is here while engineers are doing their part by making renewable energy cheaper activists are mounting efforts to weaken the companies directly and there are some signs that the pressure is working an effort that i helped launch beginning in 2012 to persuade universities and churches to divest their fossil fuel shares has spread rapidly and become the largest divestment campaign in history over the last five years insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds have joined in raising the total value of endowments and portfolios involved to over 8 trillion and prompting shell to declare the campaign a material risk to its future business early last year the governments of new york city and london pledged to divest their pension funds and the entire nation of ireland joined in midsummer campaigns have also targeted banks like wells fargo and jp morgan chase to force them to stop supporting particular pipelines the bottom line is clear to the degree that the fossil fuel industry is weakened by some combination of technological change and furious activism the chances for serious change increase if energy barons like the koch brothers and exxon remain flush with cash they can probably delay or undermine initiatives like the green new deal but if their businesses are under strong pressure from a rapidly changing energy economy polities around the world would be freer to take the steps that scientists insist are necessary with the speed required to prevent global catastrophe should these changes happen quickly they could do more than save us from planetary peril a new world the january report on the geopolitics of energy transformation from the international renewable energy agency irena is one of the most hopeful documents i ve read in a long time it points out that for the 80 percent of the world s population that lives in countries that are net importers of fossil fuels the transition to renewable energy means the end of a crushing import burden the long term consequences of a switch to renewables are very positive said bond who helped write the report fossil fuels are produced by a small number of companies and countries and the benefits flow to a small number of people with solar and wind you get a lot more local jobs a lot more local investment you get a whole new geopolitics take india the poorest large nation on earth it imports 80 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its gas along with much of its coal currently that costs the country 240 billion a year if as its leaders hope its economy grows 7 percent annually that figure would double in a decade which is economically unsustainable renewables also offer developing economies an opportunity to leapfrog not only fossil fuels but to some extent the need for a centralized electricity grid the irena report concludes countries in africa and south asia have a golden opportunity to avoid expensive fixed investments in fossil fuels and centralized grids by adopting mini grids and decentralized solar and wind energy deployed off grid just as they jumped straight to mobile phones and obviated the need to lay expensive copper wired telephone networks the changeover of course would be rocky beyond the effects on the global economy or on particular companies and their investors countries like russia or saudi arabia and increasingly parts of the us are essentially oil companies themselves as these petro states face a fall in the value of their only real asset there is a risk of destabilization on a vast scale in fact it s possible that we re in the early stages of this process with mischief and cruelty increasingly on display as countries with no other source of economic power struggle to maintain profits while they can the worst damage will as usual be inflicted on the poorest oil producers kuwait might be able to manage the transition but could angola yet overall the benefits would be immeasurable imagine a world in which the tortured politics of the middle east weren t magnified in

natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent 6 mcf bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead all boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 utilizing a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value initial rates of production references in this press release to initial production rates associated with certain wells are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for the company the company cautions that such production rates should be considered to be preliminary oil and gas metrics this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as fd a costs recycle ratio operating netback reserve life index and sustaining capital these terms do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons fd a costs are used as a measure of capital efficiency fd a presented herein has been calculated based on exploration development and acquisition capital spent in the applicable period including changes in future development capital if applicable for that period divided by the change in reserves for that period including revisions for that same period bellatrix provides fd a costs that incorporate all acquisitions and exclude the reserve capital and fdc impact of dispositions during the year the calculation of fd a herein is based on working interest reserves recycle ratio is a measure for evaluating the effectiveness of a company s reinvestment program and the efficiency of capital investment it accomplishes this by comparing the operating netback per boe to that year s reserve fd a cost per boe see non gaap measures above for a description of how operating netbacks are calculated the reserve life index for 2018 is calculated by dividing reserves as at december 31 2018 by 2019 forecasted average production and has been presented to provide a measure of the amount of time production could be sustained at the production rates based on the reserves at the applicable point in time sustaining capital refers to capital expenditures to maintain production from existing facilities at current production levels additional details of how certain of these measures have been calculated are included in the press release of the company dated march 14 2019 which is available on the company s website at www bxe com and are filed on sedar at www sedar com and on edgar at www sec gov edgar drilling locations this press release discloses drilling locations in three categories i proved locations ii probable locations and iii unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations which are sometimes collectively referred to as booked locations are derived from the company s most recent independent reserves evaluation of the company s assets as prepared by insite petroleum consultants ltd insite as of december 31 2018 and account for drilling locations that have associated proved or probable reserves as applicable unbooked locations are internal estimates based on the company s prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves or resources of the 382 net spirit river drilling locations identified herein 132 are proved or probable locations and 250 are unbooked locations of the 251 net cardium drilling locations identified herein 127 are proved or probable locations and 124 are unbooked locations unbooked locations have specifically been identified by management as an estimation of our multi year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic seismic and engineering production and reserves data on prospective acreage and geologic formations the drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend upon the availability of capital regulatory approvals seasonal restrictions oil and natural gas prices costs actual drilling results and other factors while certain of the unbooked drilling locations have been derisked by drilling existing wells in relative close proximity to such unbooked drilling locations the majority of other unbooked drilling locations are farther away from existing wells where management has less information about the characteristics of the reservoir and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty that such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves the reserves data set forth herein is based upon a report prepared by insite the company s independent reserves evaluator which is an independent reserves assessment and evaluation prepared by insite with an effective date of december 31 2018 the report prepared by insite was prepared in accordance with the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook and national instrument 51 101 standards of disclosure of oil and gas

ofx daily market news posted by ofx united states dollar the us dollar index fell 0 50 percent in yesterday s trading session on a positive day for equity markets and risky assets however it is bouncing in a counter trend rally this morning around 0 25 percent the reason probably us china trade updates regarding the us china trade deal president donald trump and xi jinping won t meet to sign a trade agreement until the hoped for summit takes place at the end of april according to gary cohn a former head of donald trump s national economic council trump is desperate for a deal the president needs a win on us china trade negotiation talks cohn s comments contradict trump s comments who said earlier i m not in a rush whatsoever on top of that the us trade representative robert lighthizer gave testimony before the senate finance committee yesterday he said that america must keep the option of raising tariffs to be sure beijing lives up to any trade deal moreover republican senator rob portman said no deal would be closed without substantial changes to how china treats intellectual property rights canadian dollar usd cad expected range 1 3325 1 3375 the loonie rallied against the us dollar furiously around 0 50 percent following crude oil wti price action which reached new highs from november 13 2018 around the mid usd 58s representing an increase of over 2 percent this happened after yesterday s news of outages in venezuela and iran and the coordinated opec led supply curbs this morning though the crude oil price is trading flat in mixed price action for crude oil as market participants weighed declining us oil inventories against a report showing opec slowed down its rate of agreed to production cuts on the release side the new housing price index for january came in at 0 1 percent when the forecast was 0 percent however all the lights will be on senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins tonight who will speak before the vancouver school of economics and cfa society vancouver at 7 05pm est story continues the usd cad is bouncing this morning weaker loonie erasing almost all of yesterday s gains and trading at 1 3345 after it started its rally from 1 3350 in yesterday s trading session right now nearly all of yesterday s gains are gone therefore based on the charts the usd cad seems to have had a capitulation day yesterday and it might be restarting its uptrend for today we expect a strong support level around 1 3322 and even a 1 3300 handle is likely if crude helps the loonie this morning however a resistance around 1 3350 and then 1 3375 are good levels to see the usd cad in case the risk on mood in the fx capital markets fade away for whatever reason euro eur usd expected range 1 1275 1 1325 the euro has managed to draw a breath against the usd and has recovered most of its losses seen last week due to the ecb where the eur usd dropped to below 1 12 if you were looking to take advantage of 21 month lows you may have missed the opportunity today sees the release of final inflation numbers for france and germany which aren t expected to waver too far from the flash estimates on friday we have the figures for the whole of the euro area but the weak numbers still linger for the ecb with core inflation down below 1 percent the eur usd pair trades at 1 1302 a 0 21 percent fall this morning british pound gbp usd expected range 1 3015 1 3425 so as expected late last night the house of commons voted against a no deal brexit under any circumstances although the margin of victory was much closer than this writer had thought more importantly as well it was confirmed that just over half of mps 53 percent had some common sense and realized how dire a no deal brexit would be off the back of the narrow victory which confusingly was seen as a defeat for the government the pound breathed a sigh of relief and due to the late vote pushed through a number of key figures against the us dollar and hit one year highs against the euro as parliamentary procedure expect jacob rees mogg highlighted to the bbc this changed very little and the uk is still set to leave the eu on the 29th of march as this is written in statute and this takes precedence over last night s motion while probably correct theresa may also supported the idea by saying the legal default in eu and uk law is that the uk will leave without a deal unless something else is agreed so we move onto today s vote which should be the most significant for the pound if mps reject the idea of an extension as it risks the uk possibly never leaving the eu then they may want to have another look at theresa may s tuesday night option and we may have another meaningful vote as soon as next week for a long time the playing field was between may s deal versus a no deal but now that this has been ruled out it looks like it could be may s deal vs no brexit the paradigm has shifted the gbp usd is trading at 1 3263 this morning after it reached 1 3381 in yesterday trading session a new high from june 14 2018 australian dollar aud usd expected range 0 7025 0 7075 overnight industrial production figures out of china came in showing output growth sinking to a 17 year low as the slowdown in china rolled into the new year this follows the disappointing gdp figures seen recently when growth also sunk to 30 year lows while the aussie is on the back foot against the pound due to brexit updates it is also down against the usd the aud usd pair trades at 0 7050 a 0 64 percent fall this morning new zealand dollar nzd usd expected range 0 67900 0 6820 the kiwi followed its aussie neighbour overnight performing meekly as chinese data continued to disappoint investors next week s q4 gdp figures couldn t come soon enough for the new zealand dollar especially in fallow weeks like this the nzd usd pair is trading lower at 0 6811 a 0 68 percent fall this morning posted by ofx

1 what experience makes you the best candidate to serve as trustee my wife and i have lived in oak park for 28 years as renters and as owners i am a professor at the university of chicago s business school and a partner in a female owned consulting business my expertise is in organizational change and management decision making skills that are certainly needed on the village board co founder of two community groups advocating for the people of oak park coalition for appropriate development and voice i have testified to the plan commission and to the village board in support of development that respects the unique character of the village its neighborhoods and the environment and in favor of greater transparency and fiscal responsibility in village government i also served on the park district citizens committee the people of oak park deserve a village government that listens to its citizens inviting our input well before decisions have been made we deserve a village government that bases its decisions on real evidence of what s best for all the people who live here a village government that actively promotes the vision of an affordable inclusive integrated equitable and welcoming village with sound environmental practices to achieve this vision we need trustworthy leaders who are prepared progressive and pragmatic i am prepared with a track record of working diligently for more appropriate development throughout our village and for a village government that is more transparent fiscally responsible and citizen oriented progressive committed to an inclusive democratic equitable community where all kinds of oak parkers can afford to live together as neighbors pragmatic with a career as a professor of management at the university of chicago s business school i know how to make things happen in organizations 2 what do you consider the top three issues of concern in oak park and how would you address them as a trustee there are four top issues as proposed by the community action group voice oak park as a trustee i will work to build a transparent and democratic government in which the people of our village decide the future of oak park fulfill the promise of our reputation as a truly equitable community advance policies that support the economic diversity of our community home owners renters and local businesses advocate development that will bring oak park into the future without sacrificing its character its values or the environment how to address the first three of these priorities is answered in the questions below therefore the remainder of this answer will elaborate on the final top issue appropriate development there is a detailed statement of my development policy on the website klaymanforoakpark org this is a brief summary of key points oak park like all towns needs to encourage appropriate development in order to thrive appropriate development provides new housing opportunities for people at all different income levels see also question 3 and new opportunities for local businesses and jobs while respecting and enhancing the unique character of the village and its neighborhoods and protecting the environment appropriate development should take place throughout the village and not just be concentrated in and around downtown oak park citizens particularly neighbors and local businesses must be included in the entire design and selection process not just at the end and any development beyond established zoning must provide solid evidence that it will have a positive impact on the quality of life of its neighbors and of the village at large developers claim that massive high rise developments help keep taxes down but oak park s own experience and research by economists and urban planners show that such massive developments do not accomplish that goal we need to think about revitalizing different parts of the village we need to think about housing for middle class and working class residents we need to think about attracting a variety of businesses and good jobs to our village and very importantly we need to keep this a truly integrated town development decisions also have major impact on the environment and environmental issues have not been getting the attention they deserve in the current campaigns or in village government it is neither environmentally sound nor in keeping with the character of oak park to authorize development that diminishes the already limited green spaces we have in our village but avoiding harm is not sufficient each project should enhance the local environment by contributing to green space and by adhering to tough standards for energy efficiency and sustainability i fully support the resolution recently proposed to the board of trustees on january 28 by the oak park climate action group which included an appropriate timeline for the village to move toward 100 clean sustainable energy sources by 2035 3 what is your position on affordable housing in the village is more or less needed why how would you address this as a trustee we need more affordable housing in oak park in order to maintain our village s diversity one key action in creating the affordable housing we need in oak park is to enact an inclusionary zoning ordinance izo an izo requires that developers include a certain percentage of affordable units in new residential developments or else pay in lieu of fees a set amount paid into a fund for building affordable housing elsewhere in the village the trustees and village staff deserve kudos for initiating the effort toward inclusionary zoning and especially for bringing this preliminary proposal before the public while it is still being developed the work of creating an effective inclusionary ordinance will continue for the new village board here are some key issues that i will focus on as trustee we must focus not just on the number of affordable units but also on where those units are located it sometimes makes sense to allow developers to pay in lieu of fees rather than include affordable units in their buildings but an ordinance that encourages developers to build luxury apartments in one part of town while paying to build affordable units in a different part of town risks undoing decades of work to create a village where all kinds of people live together as neighbors as trustee i will work for incentives for developers to create buildings and neighborhoods that are integrated racially economically and by family structure a related issue is that the currently proposed ordinance applies only to two narrow corridors around the el lines the unintended effect could be to encourage developers to build away from transit where they can avoid paying for affordable housing as trustee i will guard against the risk that such a limited ordinance might unintentionally work against the goals of transit oriented development and affordable housing let s also consider the definition of affordable housing one standard in the proposed ordinance is that housing should be affordable for a family earning 67 000 per year yes we need affordable options for middle income families like that but are there sufficient incentives for developers to also provide for those who make 47 000 or 27 000 as trustee i will assure that there are the current proposal allows some developers who contribute to affordable housing to exceed established zoning limits i would not allow inclusionary zoning to serve as an indirect way to undermine whatever controls remain on height and density for new developments inclusionary zoning is the tool with the most potential to improve the affordable housing situation in oak park but not the only one as trustee i will keep my eye on the larger picture investigating additional possible approaches to affordable housing such as modifying real estate fees to favor affordable and mixed income buildings and having developers pay into a fund for direct rental subsidies i will also champion support for the oak park housing center the center needs to modernize its approach to promoting racial and economic diversity and integration in the village and as a specialist in organizational renewal this is something i want to help make happen as trustee and as a concerned citizen 4 how would you work to ensure greater equity and diversity in the village equity quoting linda francis director of the oak park and river forest success for all youth program equity needs more than good intentions it needs intentional actions equity requires finding the obstacles that are holding some people back doing the hard work of removing those obstacles and then making the extra effort to help those people catch up equity requires recognizing that policies and actions affect different people differently and that no one person can fully anticipate all those different perspectives people who feel disenfranchised may not show up to say hey listen to me as trustee i will push to implement active outreach in which village decision makers seek out underrepresented people treating them as equals actively listening to them and taking their perspective into account racial equity is a primary concern but i will also emphasize equity in terms of gender sexual orientation disabilities renters vs owners different language communities and so on i will work to promote training including racial equity training for all village staff and elected officials i will also push to reform processes and institutions that create inequity when and where meetings are held and how they advertised how the village communicates with citizens and how citizens are empowered to affect the outcomes how decisions are made and by whom diversity i live in a small condo building near downtown oak park twelve people live in our building three are african american 4 are white 5 are hispanic latinx they are a single parent with a small child two seniors two empty nesters two single people and a two parent family with kids in oak park schools next door on one side is a single family home on the other side is a rental building this is what living in oak park should be like for everyone i will work hard to make oak park a place where all different kinds of people can afford to live together as neighbors by increasing equity see above controlling taxes and fees see question 5 promoting affordable housing for middle class working class and low income residents see question 3 and upholding oak park s dedication to integration by race economic status and family status 5 what should the village do to help ease the tax burden in oak park high property taxes are a key issue for oak parkers pushing out some residents who would otherwise like to continue living here high taxes and fees are a major impediment to keeping oak park economically and racially diverse neither austerity nor gentrification is an acceptable response even though the village controls a relatively small portion of the tax burden it needs to show leadership in managing its finances responsibly to that end we need budget reform realigned priorities and more appropriate revenue sources budget reform will require that the village set a limit for total expenditures in a given year with increases at less than the rate of inflation and then prioritize programs within that limit the budget process must be more transparent so that trustees and the public can see clearly what is being spent on which program priorities should be based on what helps the broadest range of residents what helps those with the greatest need and what helps people most directly in looking at the effects of affordability we must also look beyond property taxes taking care not to shift the burden to fees and fines in a way that places a greater burden on those who can least afford to pay looking beyond oak park i will also lobby the state to live up to its responsibility to be the primary funder of public education as required by the illinois constitution trustees must focus on local government but our local property tax burden is due in no small part to the state s failure to fully fund our public schools i have spoken with state senator don harmon about this and we have his support for this effort 6 what would you do to ensure greater cooperation between oak park s various taxing entities to ensure real cooperation and collaboration among all the taxing entities i will push for joint planning cross agency administration of programs and sharing of common functions it s hard work for different taxing entities to figure out together how to spend the citizens dollars more efficiently and effectively it s work i m prepared to do as trustee i will involve our existing intergovernmental committee igov in building processes for joint planning and coordination i will promote reliance on multi entity task forces to manage projects and issues that cross boundaries such as safety services to teens and seniors homelessness budgeting capital improvements affordable housing and more i will work hard to help all taxing entities find efficiencies in shared functions such as purchasing and payroll none of these ideas involve consolidation a concept that makes a good soundbite and an attractive referendum when the words property tax reduction are attached to it some recent proposals for consolidation feel more like a hostile takeover by the village than a real effort at coordination and collaboration with cost savings being purely speculative and the legality of consolidation in doubt the only group certain to profit from attempting consolidation is lawyers meanwhile there is a real risk that consolidation would interfere with the crucial community services provided by the township the libraries and the park district i will work to keep that from happening as we work toward greater cooperation and collaboration 7 what are your thoughts on transparency in the village is more or less needed or is the village currently striking a good balance on transparency yes we need more transparency in the village even more important we need more democracy in the village transparency implies that people can see what their government is doing democracy means that we increase the involvement of elected officials and citizens in what government does to achieve greater democracy and transparency we must improve communication and outreach empower the citizens commissions and enhance the role of the village clerk improve communication and outreach our village government should actively reach out to citizens not merely make information available to those who already know what to look for there are many steps that can be taken here are a few examples publish meeting agendas and links to relevant information at least 10 days ahead of meetings and have them sent out via email and social media to contacts in local community organizations and to individuals who sign on to receive them establish regular town hall meetings in which officials truly interact with citizens to learn their concerns and gather their ideas actively reach out to underrepresented groups including african american hispanic lgbtq people with disabilities renters seniors low income families and any other subset of the population who might be affected by government decisions create trustee office hours available for hearing from constituents perhaps designating a particular trustee as the point of first contact for a particular issue or for a particular geographic segment of the village let the sun shine on the workings of the oak park economic development corporation this important quasi governmental agency includes the village president one other trustee and the village manager it has tremendous power over development decisions in our village and yet its current practices and its designation as a private corporation shield it from the inclusiveness and transparency demanded of other parts of village government empower the citizens commissions the village board should encourage and empower the citizens commissions to pursue the issues they think are most relevant and to bring forward new initiatives on those issues the total annual expense of 25 000 to support the commissions is a very small cost for the remarkable expertise and dedication of the citizens on those commissions greater reliance on the citizens commissions can reduce reliance on expensive outside consultants i testified on these issues at the january 14 meeting of the village board where i also expressed concerns about the village manager restricting the scope of the commissions to increase the independence and effectiveness of the commissions all nominations for all the commissions should go through an independent citizens involvement commission that screens applicants using established criteria for relevant expertise this had been an established process in our village but we have recently seen a shift toward commission nominations being made directly by the mayor that shift should be reversed enhance the role of the village clerk village clerk is an elected position that democratic control is important because the village clerk has the responsibility to keep the public informed about what village government is doing the recent attempt to shift the foia process from the clerk to the village attorney was very troubling attorneys are by trade concerned with where the legal boundaries are not with how best to provide useful information it was good news when many of the clerk s responsibilities were reinstated but the broader issue of preserving the authority of the clerk remains a concern the village clerk should also exercise the vital role of serving as ombudsperson and initial point of contact for dealing with village government having an elected official perform that role provides citizens with greater assurance that the person they contact puts the citizen s interests first related

per pound of copper produced commenting on the 2018 results david strang president ceo of ero stated our operational results from the fourth quarter of 2018 continue to reflect the growing nature of our business and the underlying quality of our asset base particularly with respect to excess mill capacity our operating run rate during the fourth quarter of over 777 000 tonnes of ore processed was an important high water mark for the company as it demonstrates we are capable of operating at annualized throughput levels in excess of 3 1 million tonnes per annum well above our forecast rate of approximately 2 0 million tonnes per annum over the next several years as we continue to look into the future we aim to more effectively utilize this excess capacity through our on going exploration programs resource conversion and re sequencing the life of mine plan around these results during the period we saw increased contribution from our newly constructed vermelhos underground mine which was completed on budget approximately four months ahead of schedule and commissioned during the third quarter the acceleration of vermelhos combined with incremental production from surubim through year end allowed us to significantly exceed our original 2018 production guidance we cannot say enough about the quality of execution by our operating teams in brazil throughout the year in addition to exceeding production targets bringing vermelhos into commercial production ahead of schedule and advancing several high value initiatives during a period of significant ramp up in operating activity the team as a whole was able to do so while achieving the best safety record in the 39 year operating history of the company s subsidiary mcsa of all the notable achievements of 2018 this is by far the most significant as we look towards 2019 we see several opportunities crystallizing before us on exploration the benefit of several months of disciplined data interpretation on the back of our completed regional airborne survey has re ignited our own excitement for the potential of the curaçá valley as an emerging world class mineral district this excitement is best evidenced around the vermelhos mine where we now have nine drill rigs operating a significant ramp up compared to year end when only five rigs were operating this increase in exploration effort now includes the first two underground drill rigs deployed to the mine which will be testing extensions of the high grade vermelhos deposit to depth on mining we continue to advance investments in ventilation development and new technologies aimed at improving operating performance and decreasing costs at our mill we have commenced detailed engineering on an upgraded regrind circuit which we anticipate will significantly improve overall metallurgical recoveries and plant performance once operational during the second quarter of 2020 the company s financial statements for the period were impacted by non cash adjustments related to the company s debt refinancing and movements of the brazilian real brl against the us dollar during the period particularly as it relates to the translation of us dollar debt held by the company s subsidiary mineração caraíba s a mcsa into brl its functional currency accordingly the company believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted net gain loss are better reflections of the company s underlying performance ebitda adjusted net income loss c1 cash cost of copper produced per lb and c1 cash cost of gold produced per oz are non ifrs measures see the notes section of this press release for a discussion on non ifrs measures operations exploration highlights mining milling operations record year and quarter total of approximately 2 3 million tonnes of ore grading 1 56 copper mined and processed during the year producing 30 426 tonnes of copper in concentrate after average metallurgical recoveries of 86 3 fourth quarter mill throughput of 777 480 tonnes grading 1 77 copper producing 12 104 tonnes of copper in concentrate after metallurgical recoveries that averaged 87 8 during the period early commissioning of the vermelhos mine approximately 4 months ahead of schedule resulted in a total of 206 873 tonnes of ore grading 2 72 copper mined contributing to the annual production result with 143 661 tonnes grading 2 77 copper mined during the fourth quarter the company s 97 6 owned nx gold mine processed 117 857 tonnes of ore grading 11 55 grams per tonne gold resulting in the production of 39 808 ounces of gold and 24 700 ounces of silver as by product after metallurgical recoveries that averaged 91 0 during the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 record year and quarter exploration activities 21 drill rigs now operating stage set for transformational year vermelhos district near surface drilling of the recently announced east zone discovery was highlighted during the period by drill hole fvs 311 that intersected 27 4 meters grading 8 39 copper including 17 7 meters grading 10 76 copper from 81 2 meters downhole this result was part of 7 holes drilled within 100 meters of surface that when combined with the initial discovery holes and subsequent drilling confirm the vermelhos east zone is not a discrete zone but rather a semi continuous mineralized structure extending from the vermelhos mine ug1 mining area in a north northeast direction over a strike length of approximately 1 1 kilometers see the company s press release dated december 11 2018 for additional detail to date the vermelhos east zone has been delineated from surface to a depth of approximately 400 meters and remains open along strike and to depth currently nine exploration drill rigs are operating at vermelhos including six surface rigs two underground drill rigs and one high powered reverse circulation rc rig these rigs are testing mineralized continuity below the currently defined mineral resources at the vermelhos mine along the east zone between the vermelhos mine and the vermelhos west deposit as well as additional near mine anomalies located along the same north northeast structural trend pilar district exploration activities continue to focus on extensions to the deepening as well as extensions and infill of the recently announced west limb discovery see the company s press release dated may 17 2018 for additional information on the west limb discovery all pilar exploration targets are within or adjacent to existing pilar underground mine infrastructure currently seven underground and three surface drill rigs are operating at pilar testing continuity of these discoveries surubim district drilling activities continue to focus on evaluating new target areas adjacent to the surubim open pit mine currently two exploration drill rigs are operating within the district regional programs the company s airborne geophysical survey which was completed during the third quarter of 2018 continues to yield significant results throughout the curaçá valley more recently advanced probabilistic modelling of the vermelhos district has resulted in an increase in exploration activity within the district and re prioritization of drilling nine rigs are currently operating in and around the vermelhos mine an increase of 4 drill rigs as compared to year end 2018 21 drill rigs now operating stage set for

bias towards the first half of the year due to higher grade stope sequencing at both the pilar and vermelhos underground mines as well as incremental production from the r22w open pit mine r22w is expected to augment underground production during the first half of the year contributing approximately 250 000 tonnes of ore grading 0 50 copper underground production from the pilar mine is expected to contribute a total of approximately 1 3 million tonnes grading 1 80 copper while underground production from the vermelhos mine is expected to contribute a total of approximately 500 000 tonnes

average three quarters saikat chatterjee is it good to be passive 1141 gmt should one be active or passive a new report suggests passive investing on a roll in recent years will overtake its older better established cousin in the united states by 2021 the report by moody s says its data showed record outflows from u s active funds last year active investment strategies share of the total declined to 63 3 percent from 75 percent in 2013 the share of passive investment on the other hand has risen steadily and is set to exceed 50 percent by 2021 moody s projects versus an estimated 36 7 percent last year the boom is global fundamentally it s driven by the belief that index tracking vehicles such as etfs are more efficient at channelling corporate earnings into investors pockets as they cut out hefty fees and commissions to fund managers and traders but there are other drivers too for one there is growing concentration in the active industry as more money migrates to a small pool of superior managers second there s a trend towards even lower fee passive products fidelity for instance has launched a suite of zero fee etfs moody s notes passive is gaining ground in europe too passive funds assets will rise to 25 percent by 2025 from 14 5 percent at end 2018 moody s predicts here the eu s mifid 2 rules are helping as these provide better visibility into the fees that active funds are charging these changes will likely push retail investors toward cheaper passive funds including etfs just as they become more widely available through investment online platforms moody s concludes whether the passive strategy pays off in these turbulent times with wild intraday swings in indices and stock prices in recent months remains to be seen sujata rao tgif and no brexit

that delays on the shaft 2 fit out are expected to result in an overall schedule delay to sustainable first production beyond the end of q3 21 additionally rio tinto is studying relocating the ore passes on the footprint and this may modify the initiation sequence within panel 0 the study will be incorporated into the definitive estimate 1 please refer to the non gaap measures section of this press release for further information financial results income in 2018 was 394 3 million compared with 110 9 million in 2017 the increase mainly reflects the 240 2 million increase in revenue driven primarily by the 150 0 increase in gold production in addition there were reduced unit costs of production driven by higher head grades and recoveries as oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold content further there was reduced depreciation and depletion due to certain long lived assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives and lower finance costs due to higher amounts capitalized to property plant and equipment cash generated from operating activities in 2018 was 180 0 million compared to 118 0 million in 2017 primarily reflecting the impact of higher sales revenue capital expenditure on property plant and equipment was 1 3 billion on a cash basis in 2018 compared with 917 5 million in 2017 attributed principally to underground development 1 2 billion with the remainder related to open pit activities turquoise hill s cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 were 1 6 billion oyu tolgoi the oyu tolgoi mine is approximately 550 kilometres south of ulaanbaatar mongolia s capital city and 80 kilometres north of the mongolia china border mineralization on the property consists of porphyry style copper gold silver and molybdenum contained in a linear structural trend the oyu tolgoi trend of deposits throughout this trend they include from south to north the heruga deposit the oyut deposit and the hugo dummett deposits hugo south hugo north and hugo north extension the oyu tolgoi mine was initially developed as an open pit operation the copper concentrator plant with related facilities and necessary infrastructure was originally designed to process approximately 100 000 tonnes of ore per day from the oyut open pit however since 2014 the concentrator has improved operating practices and gained experience which has helped achieve a consistent throughput of over 105 000 tonnes per day concentrator throughput for 2019 is targeted at 110 000 tonnes per day and expected to be approximately 40 million tonnes for the year in august 2013 development of the underground mine was suspended pending resolution of matters with the government of mongolia government following signing of the oyu tolgoi underground mine development and financing plan underground plan in may 2015 and the signing of a 4 4 billion project finance facility in december 2015 oyu tolgoi received formal notice to proceed approval by the boards of turquoise hill rio tinto and oyu tolgoi llc in may 2016 which was the final requirement for the re start of underground development underground construction recommenced in may 2016 prior to suspending underground construction in august 2013 underground lateral development at hugo north lift 1 had advanced approximately 16 kilometres off shaft 1 at the end of 2018 oyu tolgoi had a total workforce employees and contractors including underground project construction of approximately 17 000 of which 92 6 were mongolian underground development progress significant progress on the oyu tolgoi underground project continued through 2018 with the construction of critical above and below ground infrastructure shaft 2 connected underground infrastructure progressed well during q4 18 with the completion of the lining installation and handover of ore bin 11 as well as advancement of the new 6 000 tonne per day jaw crusher under construction during q4 18 turquoise hill carried out its own review of the previously announced rio tinto schedule and cost re forecast for the project 2018 rio tinto review that concluded a delay to sustainable first production was expected from q1 21 to the end of q3 21 the company s review with the assistance of turquoise hill s independent qualified person and mining consultants orewin pty ltd found that project cost was expected to remain within the 5 3 billion budget but that it is likely there will be further delays to individual activities and that this will result in additional delays to sustainable first production the company s independent review found that the following key risks are developing shaft 2 equipping delays were due to lower than expected productivity in steel and electrical installation as well as increased quality assurance measures it was likely the completion date would move beyond q1 19 and impact overall underground development rate increases there have been delays to development progress and productivities in key areas even though lateral development has experienced consistent overall progress development of some critical areas such as the footprint primary crusher 1 pc1 system shaft 2 and shaft 5 have been impacted by delays and with the exception of shaft 5 are critical path items for the project schedule small delays in lateral development on the footprint have had a direct impact on the project schedule critical path even though total lateral development or equivalent development metres have been on budget development in the pc1 system which includes the pc1 chamber and transfers 3 4 and 5 has since the time of the rio tinto review data cut off fallen significantly behind target rates the company review indicated that in some areas there was a delay to the critical path from scope growth in mass excavation and additional ground support due to unexpectedly adverse geotechnical conditions although the ground support quantities and installation times are less but not materially less than planned in the 2016 oyu tolgoi feasibility study and ground support quantities are reported as lower than planned some types of ground support have had reduced installation times since completion of the company s independent review rio tinto as manager of the project has advised turquoise hill that further delays on the shaft 2 fit out are expected to contribute to an overall schedule delay to sustainable first production beyond the end of q3 21 additionally rio tinto is studying relocating the ore passes on the footprint and this may modify the initiation sequence within panel 0 the study will be incorporated into the definitive estimate review as will work necessary to estimate any impact of cost and development schedule oyu tolgoi spent 347 3 million on underground expansion during q4 18 and 1 2 billion for 2018 meeting the company s guidance total underground project spend from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 was approximately 2 3 billion underground project spend on a cash basis includes expansion capital vat and capitalized management services payment and excludes capitalized interest in addition oyu tolgoi had further capital commitments2 of 1 2 billion as of december 31 2018 at the end of q4 18 the underground project had committed almost 87 of direct project contracts and procurement packages of which 73 were to mongolian companies since the restart of project development oyu tolgoi has committed nearly 2 3 billion to mongolian vendors and contractors the main focus of 2018 was underground development the fit out of shaft 2 completion and commissioning of shaft 5 support infrastructure and the convey to surface decline shaft 2 completed sinking in january 2018 which was followed by the completion of stripping in q3 18 and commencement of the fit out process in the same quarter the completed commissioning of shaft 5 was achieved during q2 18 during 2018 underground development advanced 10 3 equivalent kilometres a 68 9 increase over 2017 due to the commissioning of the new 3 500 tonne per day crusher in the second half of 2017 and increased development capability with increased ventilation following the completion of shaft 5 despite the strong year over year progress during q4 18 underground development achieved a lower than expected 2 3 equivalent kilometres of development against a target of 3 0 equivalent kilometres the shortfall in q4 18 led to 10 3 equivalent kilometres for 2018 against the expected target of approximately 11 0 kilometers of equivalent development the underground development challenges experienced in q4 18 included time constraints during hoist rope maintenance and the introduction of a new underground traffic management plan lateral development progressed 7 9 kilometres during 2018 and was impacted by the same challenges but also a shift in priorities of resources from lateral development to mass excavation due to the latest rio tinto advice turquoise hill s previous guidance of lateral development advancement of 15 0 to 16 0 kilometres during 2019 is under review the following table provides a breakdown of the

6 compared to 939 8 million in 2017 partly due to the significant increase in gold revenue from 130 8 million in 2017 to 300 4 million in 2018 driven by the 150 0 increase in gold production as oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold content the remaining increase in revenue was driven by an increase in copper revenue due to a 5 0 increase in volumes of copper in concentrate sales and a 5 9 increase in average copper price from 2017 to 2018 cost of sales in 2018 was 777 2 million compared to 763 8 million in 2017 reflecting a 3 1 increase in the volumes of concentrates sold supported by reduced unit cost of production due to higher head grades and recoveries capital expenditure on a cash basis for 2018 was 1 304 3 million compared to 917 5 million in 2017 comprising amounts attributed to the underground project and open pit activities of 1 213 8 million and 90 5 million respectively open pit capital expenditure includes deferred stripping of 17 3 million and tailings storage facility spending of 20 3 million total operating cash costs3 at oyu tolgoi were 817 1 million in 2018 compared to 711 6 million in 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher freight and royalty costs associated with increased sales revenue and a reduction in the amount of costs capitalized as deferred stripping resulting from a decrease in the proportion of waste removed as mining resources prioritized movement of ore during the year other contributors include higher input prices for key items such as fuel and power cost of sales were 2 25 per pound of copper sold in 2018 compared with 2 32 per pound of copper sold in 2017 reflecting higher volumes of metals in concentrate sold and reduced unit cost of production due to higher head grades and recoveries oyu tolgoi s c1 cash costs3 in 2018 were 1 59 per pound of copper produced a decrease from 1 92 per pound of copper produced in 2017 and are presented net of revenues from gold and silver sales the decrease was mainly due to higher gold sales and reduced unit costs of production driven by higher head grades and recoveries as oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold content all in sustaining costs3 in 2018 were 2 20 per pound of copper produced compared with 2 39 per pound of copper produced in 2017 the decrease was mainly due to the impact of higher gold sales and higher head grades and recoveries mining costs3 in 2018 were 2 13 per tonne of material mined compared with 1 51 per tonne of material mined in 2017 the increase was mainly due to higher maintenance costs increased fuel costs and increased cycle time as the open pit deepens milling costs3 in 2018 were 7 11 per tonne of ore treated compared with 6 36 per tonne of ore treated in 2017 the increase was mainly due to higher raw material costs such as steel and increased energy costs required to process the harder phase 4 ore g a costs in 2018 were 3 03 per tonne of ore treated compared with 2 93 per tonne of ore treated in 2017 the increase was due to higher power study costs during 2018 3 please refer to the non gaap measures section of this press release for further information fourth quarter 2018 revenue of 346 2 million in q4 18 increased 37 5 compared to 251 7 million in q4 17 primarily due to the significant increase in gold revenue from 32 5 million in q4 17 to 132 7 million in q4 18 driven by the 234 3 increase in gold production due to significant increases in both grades and recovery this was partly offset by a decrease in copper revenue driven by lower average copper prices in q4 18 compared to q4 17 cost of sales for q4 18 was marginally higher at 187 7 million compared to 182 7 million in q4 17 the increase was due to the 9 1 increase in the volumes of concentrates sold partly offset by a reduced unit cost of production due to higher head grades and recoveries capital expenditure on a cash basis for q4 18 was 371 8 million compared to 330 4 million in q4 17 comprising amounts attributed to the underground project and open pit activities of 347 3 million and 24 5 million respectively total operating cash costs3 at oyu tolgoi were 242 4 million in q4 18 compared to 217 7 million in q4 17 this was principally due to higher freight and royalty costs associated with higher sales revenue operating cash costs include the 5 royalty payable to the government of mongolia and exclude deferred stripping costs cost of sales was 2 12 per pound of copper sold in q4 18 compared with 2 32 per pound of copper sold in

release for further information full year 2018 oyu tolgoi delivered a strong operational performance in 2018 exceeding both copper and gold production guidance full year copper production of 159 100 tonnes and gold production of 285 000 ounces increased 1 1 and 150 0 respectively over 2017 during 2018 oyu tolgoi benefitted from the processing of phase 4 ore that contained higher gold grades fourth quarter 2018 gold production in q4 18 increased 234 3 over q4 17 due to significant increases in both grades and recovery copper production in q4 18 declined 8 4 over q4 17 due to lower throughput which was partially offset by higher grades and recovery as planned mill throughput in q4 18 decreased 13 6 over q4 17 due to the concentrator processing harder phase 4 ore compared to the processing of predominately softer phase 6 ore in q4 17 operational outlook oyu tolgoi is expected to produce 125 000 to 155 000 tonnes of copper and 180 000 to 220 000 ounces of gold in concentrates for 2019 open pit operations are expected to mine ore primarily from phase 4 throughout the year with contributions from phase 6 mill throughput for 2019 is expected to be approximately 40 million tonnes and it includes the processing of some material from mine stockpiles operating cash costs for 2019 are expected to be 800 million to 850 million capital expenditures for 2019 on a cash basis are expected to be 150 million to 180 million for open pit operations and 1 3 billion to 1 4 billion for underground development open pit capital is mainly comprised of deferred stripping equipment purchases maintenance componentization and tailings storage facility construction underground development capital includes both expansion capital and vat c1 cash costs are expected to be 1 75 to 1 95 per pound of copper produced unit cost guidance assumes the midpoint of expected 2019 copper and gold production ranges and a gold price of 1 281 per ounce funding of oyu tolgoi by turquoise hill in accordance with the amended and restated shareholders agreement arsha dated june 8 2011 turquoise hill has funded oyu tolgoi s cash requirements beyond internally generated cash flows by a combination of equity investment and shareholder debt for amounts funded by debt oyu tolgoi must repay such amounts including accrued interest before it can pay common share dividends as of december 31 2018 the aggregate outstanding balance of shareholder loans extended by subsidiaries of the company to oyu tolgoi was 5 0 billion including accrued interest of 0 7 billion these loans bear interest at an effective annual rate of libor plus 6 5 in accordance with the arsha a subsidiary of the company has funded the common share investments in oyu tolgoi on behalf of erdenes these funded amounts earn interest at an effective annual rate of libor plus 6 5 and are repayable by erdenes to a subsidiary of the company via a pledge over erdenes share of oyu tolgoi common share dividends erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making cash payments at any time as of december 31 2018 the cumulative amount of such funding was 1 0 billion representing 34 of invested common share equity unrecognized interest on the funding amounted to 0 5 billion as part of its independent review of the 2018 rio tinto review turquoise hill assessed the impact of the delay on amongst other things the company s cash flows and liquidity further to the outcomes of its review of the 2018 rio tinto review turquoise hill continues to have access to substantial funding options including cash forecast to be generated from operating activities cash and cash equivalents of 1 6 billion as at december 31 2018 and the remaining net proceeds from project finance of 1 9 billion which are drawn and currently held by agreement on deposit with rio tinto further under the existing project financing arrangements oyu tolgoi has the ability subject to factors such as market appetite general execution risk and the approval of the oyu tolgoi board to raise additional supplemental debt of up to 1 6 billion at the same attractive terms it is intended the raising of this supplemental debt will be progressed over the course of 2019 and 2020 to assist in funding underground development going forward including commissioning and ramp up the company is working with rio tinto to understand the issues and in parallel with the definitive estimate review turquoise hill will assess the impact of any further delay to sustainable first production beyond the end of q3 21 on the company s cash flows liquidity and funding requirements as well as investigate potential mitigation options additionally oyu tolgoi is currently undertaking a feasibility study and is in discussions with the government to progress the construction of a coal fired power plant and related infrastructure at tavan tolgoi while it is necessary to await the completion of this study to reliably estimate the associated cost and further to await the outcome of related negotiations to determine the quantum of oyu tolgoi s funding requirement there is a provision under the existing project finance documentation to increase oyu tolgoi s current total debt capacity of 6 0 billion to assist in funding an expansion facility such as a tavan tolgoi based power plant and related infrastructure oyu tolgoi signs power source framework agreement on february 15 2018 oyu tolgoi received notification that the government had cancelled the power sector cooperation agreement psca which was signed in august 2014 the government s action under section 1 3 of the psca indicated the tavan tolgoi power project was no longer a viable option as a result of the government s action effective february 15 2018 long term power for oyu tolgoi must be domestically sourced within four years in accordance with the 2009 oyu tolgoi investment agreement investment agreement on december 31 2018 oyu tolgoi and the government signed the psfa which provides a binding framework and pathway forward for the construction of a tavan tolgoi based power project as well as established the basis for a long term domestic power solution for the mine the psfa formalized the role of each party and sets out an amended timetable for oyu tolgoi to source power domestically construction is expected to start in 2020 following further studies and commissioning of the power plant is scheduled for mid 2023 oyu tolgoi will now move forward to confirm the technical design of the project and finalize the commercial arrangements including financing underpinning the psfa the 300 megawatt plant will be majority owned by oyu tolgoi llc and will be situated close to the tavan tolgoi coalfields oyu tolgoi tax assessment on january 16 2018 turquoise hill announced that oyu tolgoi had received and was evaluating a tax assessment for approximately 155 million from the mongolian tax authority mta relating to an audit on taxes imposed and paid by oyu tolgoi llc between 2013 and 2015 in january 2018 oyu tolgoi paid an amount of approximately 5 0 million to settle unpaid taxes fines and penalties for accepted items following engagement with the mta oyu tolgoi was advised that the mta could not resolve oyu tolgoi s objections to the tax assessment accordingly on march 15 2018 oyu tolgoi issued a notice of dispute to the government under the investment agreement and on april 13 2018 oyu tolgoi submitted a claim to the mongolian administrative court the administrative court has currently suspended the processing of the case for an indefinite period based on current procedural uncertainty in relation to the tax assessment disputes chapter 14 of the investment agreement sets out a dispute resolution process the issuance of a notice of dispute is the first step in the dispute resolution process and includes a 60 working day negotiation period the parties were unable to reach a resolution during the 60 working day period however the parties have continued discussions in an attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith if unsuccessful the next step would be dispute resolution through international arbitration turquoise hill is of the opinion that oyu tolgoi has paid all taxes and charges required under the investment agreement the arsha the underground plan and mongolian law mongolian parliamentary working group in march 2018 the speaker of the mongolian parliament appointed a parliamentary working group working group that consisted of 13 members of parliament to

forward looking statements or information with respect to specific forward looking information concerning the continued operation and development of oyu tolgoi the company has based its assumptions and analyses on certain factors which are inherently uncertain uncertainties and assumptions include among others the timing and cost of the construction and expansion of mining and processing facilities the timing and availability of a long term domestic power source or the availability of financing for the company to construct such a source for oyu tolgoi the ability to secure and draw down on the supplemental debt under the oyu tolgoi project financing facility and the availability of additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to oyu tolgoi llc rio tinto and the company to further develop oyu tolgoi the impact of changes in changes in interpretation to or changes in enforcement of laws regulations and government practices in mongolia the availability and cost of skilled labour and transportation the obtaining of and the terms and timing of obtaining necessary environmental and other government approvals consents and permits delays and the costs which would result from delays in the development of the underground mine which could significantly exceed the costs projected in the 2016 oyu tolgoi feasibility study and the 2016 oyu tolgoi technical report projected copper gold and silver prices and their market demand and production estimates and the anticipated yearly production of copper gold and silver at oyu tolgoi the cost timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of a property such as oyu tolgoi it is common in mining operations and in the development or expansion of existing facilities to experience unexpected problems and delays during development construction and mine start up additionally although oyu tolgoi has achieved commercial production there is no assurance that future development activities will result in profitable mining operations the december 31 2018 md a the md a also contains references to estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources the estimation of reserves and resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors the mineral resource estimates contained in the md a are inclusive of mineral reserves further mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation including future production from oyu tolgoi the anticipated tonnages and grades that will be achieved or the indicated level of recovery that will be realized which may prove to be unreliable there can be no assurance that these estimates will be accurate or that such mineral reserves and mineral resources can be mined or processed profitably see the discussion under the headings language regarding reserves and resources and note to united states investors concerning estimates of measured indicated and inferred resources in section 20 cautionary statements of the md a such estimates are in large part based on the following interpretations of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques large scale mineral continuity and character of the deposits can be improved with additional drilling and sampling actual mineralization or formations may be different from those predicted it may also take many years from the initial phase of drilling before production is possible and during that time the economic feasibility of exploiting a deposit may change reserve and resource estimates are materially dependent on prevailing metal prices and the cost of recovering and processing minerals at the individual mine sites market fluctuations in the price of metals or increases in the costs to recover metals or the actual recovery percentage of the metal s from the company s mining projects may render mining of ore reserves uneconomic and affect the company s operations in a materially adverse manner moreover various short term operating factors may cause a mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period assumptions relating to commodity prices and exchange rates during the expected life of production mineralization of the area to be mined the projected cost of mining and the results of additional planned development work actual future production rates and amounts revenues taxes operating expenses environmental and regulatory compliance expenditures development expenditures and recovery rates may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates any significant change in these assumptions including changes that result from variances between projected and actual results could result in material downward revision to current estimates assumptions relating to projected future metal prices the company uses prices reflecting market pricing projections in the financial modeling for oyu tolgoi which are subjective in nature it should be expected that actual prices will be different than the prices used for such modeling either higher or lower and the differences could be significant and assumptions relating to the costs and availability of treatment and refining services for the metals mined from oyu tolgoi which require arrangements with third parties and involve the potential for fluctuating costs to transport the metals and fluctuating costs and availability of refining services these costs can be significantly impacted by a variety of industry specific as well as regional and global economic factors including among others those which affect commodity prices many of these factors are beyond the company s control readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking

additional detail on the financial results for the quarter and for the full year 2018 and discuss what we re seeing for 2019 before we open up the call for questions with that i ll turn the call over to brad bradley soultz chief executive officer thanks matt and welcome everyone to willscot s fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call first turn to slide 3 i d like to provide a brief overview of the company given that we have new investors and analysts joining us today as a specialty rental service market leader our mission is to provide innovative modular space and portable storage solutions we focus on providing these solutions ready to work so that our customers can forget about the space focus on what they do best working their project being productive and meeting their goals we now provide these solutions to more than 50 000 customers with a fleet of over 150 000 units which represent over 75 million square feet of temporary space through an unparalleled branch network of over 120 locations across the us canada and mexico when we deliver an immediately functional space productivity is all our customers see this value proposition is unique in the industry our customers including those new to us through recent acquisitions are embracing it and it s driving our growth if you ll turn to slide four our strategy has been to accelerate our already strong organic growth with accretive m a just over a year ago we committed to doubling the company without overpaying or over leveraging i m pleased to report that we ve delivered on that commitment as evident in our fourth quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted ebitda which were up 114 and 104 respectively year over year in summary we delivered on our commitments last year and we expect to continue to do the same into the future we delivered 216 million of adjusted ebitda in the full year 2018 which is slightly above the midpoint of our increased 2018 guidance which we issued in october of 2018 and reaffirmed in january looking forward we believe we have a simple recipe to deliver the 345 million to 365 million of adjusted ebitda organically in 2019 all the while delevering the business importantly we believe this outlook is largely within management s control due to the substantial cost synergies and organic earnings growth potential embedded in this portfolio i d like to now point out five attributes underpinning this unique and fast growing specialty rental services platform first we have significant revenue visibility given the trajectory at which we exited 2018 the 30 month average lease durations and the embedded growth from pricing and vaps initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2018 our average monthly modular rental rates in our us segment were 12 6 up on a year over year basis this result is the same as the preliminary result included in our january investor update call this represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit rate growth and we expect this momentum to continue as we look ahead on the ready to work side this value proposition continues to increase in penetration if we simply continue to deliver new units at the current level of vaps penetration we will realize a greater than 140 million revenue opportunity over the next three years as units which are currently on rent return are reequipped and redeployed this represents a 15 million increase over the preliminary results communicated in our january investor update call our vaps penetration levels are continuing to increase toward our longer term stated goals which we believe could provide additional upside over this time horizon we ll share additional context on this important new development a bit later in the call second the modspace system integration is complete we ve now fully transitioned to realization of the 70 million of cost synergies attributed to the prior acquisitions i remind 80 of these cost synergies are expected to be included in our fourth quarter 2019 run rate and we expect 90 of the associated costs to realize these synergies to be expensed in the first half of 2019 with the related cash payments completed by q4 third we have an accelerating adjusted ebitda growth and margin expansion we expect to achieve an adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million with ebitda margins expanding to 35 as we exit 2019 fourth we have substantial cash flow generation due to the discretionary nature of our capital expenditures at the midpoint of our 2019 guidance we expect free cash flow to be 140 million before growth capex and one time costs associated with realizing these cost synergies as previously noticed noted we expect 90 of these cash payments to be completed by q4 of 2019 assuming we achieve our objective of 400 million adjusted ebitda run rate our discretionary free cash flow generation will be approaching 200 million annualized rate as we exit 2019 and fifth our net income and free cash flow generation in the second half of 2019 accelerates our deleveraging into 2020 these accelerating earnings and the inherent cash flow characteristics of our platform provide confidence that by the second quarter of 2020 we expect to be at or below the 4x net debt to adjusted ebitda which is in line with our target net leverage range of 3 times to 4 times in summary we remain committed to our goal of creating long term shareholder value and are extremely excited about our future we re confident in this outlook and believe achieving a run rate of 400 million adjusted ebitda exiting 2019 is well within management s control all while delevering the business now if i turn to slide five there is no other company that has the scope scale turnkey capability and service commitment to deliver like we do for the combined business on a proforma basis our 2018 revenues were just over 1 billion and our adjusted ebitda would have been 285 million this is inclusive of our three acquisitions acton tyson and modspace as if we own them for the entire period approximately 90 of our revenues are generated in the us serving a very diverse group of end markets and over 90 of our adjusted gross profit is derived from our recurring leasing business beyond our substantial scale advantage there are three key attributes that really differentiate william scotsman first ready to work we ve repositioned the business strategically with this unique value proposition through the expansion of our offering of value added products and services or vaps our customers value it and is driving our growth with highly accretive returns second we have a differentiated and scalable operating platform over the past several years we ve invested in our people processes and technology and created a highly scalable and differentiated operating platform capable of asserting market leadership this operating platform includes sophisticated price management capital allocation characteristics we have leveraged this platform to swiftly and efficiently integrate acquired companies third we have very attractive unit economics which provide a high degree of visibility into future performance you ll recall over 90 of our adjusted gross profit is derived from our recurring leasing business which is underpinned by long lived assets typically 20 plus years coupled with average lease durations of 30 months now i ll direct you to slide six in a little over one year we ve doubled the size of the company by leveraging the unique willscot operating platform to further accelerate the already strong organic growth with highly accretive m a as depicted in the boxes above the arrow our ebitda has continued to accelerate since late november of last year when we recapitalized the company and returned to the public markets the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda of 216 million is up 74 on a year over year basis and is just above the midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance issued last october our fourth quarter 2018 revenues of 257 million and adjusted ebitda of 74 million which are up 114 and 104 respectively year over year better reflect the underlying business as this was the first full quarter that we own modspace during the same period across the bottom we joined the russell 2000 all while making and integrating three acquisitions our execution of the modspace commercial operational and systems integration on budget and earlier than schedule enables us to begin to realize the 70 million of annualized cost synergies and over 140 million of annualized vaps related revenue growth potential as a part of this journey we ve combined forces with three outstanding peer companies and hundreds of talented people that are committed to bring our customers an expanded fleet of ready to work solutions tremendous effort has gone into safely and efficiently integrating these companies and i m extremely proud of the team and their accomplishments now as we turn to slide seven i d like to highlight the 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance that we reaffirmed via press release last night while tim will take you through the full 2019 financial guidance in more detail i d like to highlight our adjusted ebitda expectations we have a very simple recipe to deliver the 345 million to 365 million adjusted ebitda organically in 2019 while delevering the business first ingredient one is already in place given we ve completed the modspace systems integration the second ingredient is to deliver the 70 million of associated cost synergies and third ingredient ph is to harmonize and further optimize rate utilization and vaps we are excited about the full year 2019 outlook and in particular the resulting adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million with ebitda margins of 35 generating substantial discretionary free cash flow as we exit 2019 importantly we believe this outlook is largely within our control we delivered on our commitments last year and we expect to do the same going forward turning to slide eight i d like to just expand upon the aforementioned cost synergies related to the acquisitions with the modspace system integration complete we ve transitioned to cost synergy realization these integrations required no changes to the willscot operating platform consistent with prior acquisitions and a further testament to the scalability of the platform there are over 70 million of annualized cost synergies associated with the acquisitions over 80 of these cost synergies are expected to be included in our fourth quarter run rate as mentioned before the balance executed in 2020 and approximately 60 of these cost synergies are related to redundant headcount with a balance split between branch real estate consolidation and other non people related sg a it s a simple equation to deliver 70 million of annualized cost synergies in order to realize these cost synergies we expect an additional 15 million to 20 million of integration and restructuring costs to be expensed we anticipate more than 90 of these costs will be expensed in the first half of 2019 with the respective cash payments disbursed by the end of 2019 we ve made significant progress now evaluating the collective owned real estate portfolio which now totals 87 million of net book value 29 million of which is associated with 19 surplus properties which are now either listed for sale or soon will be the remaining 58 million of net book value is associated with owned properties which we are continuing to utilize based upon this progress we remain confident in our ability to realize 30 million of proceeds from selling surplus real estate throughout 2019 and 2020 with potential upside as we evaluate financing alternatives for the 58 million net book value associated with the owned properties we expect to continue to utilize on a go forward basis i would also note that there are other potential cost and fleet synergies which are not yet quantified or otherwise included in the initial 70 million a few examples of these incremental opportunities yet to be evaluated include brand scale efficiency logistics optimization sourcing and procurement and further fleet optimization now as we turn to slide nine in addition to the 70 million of cost synergies there is 140 million of annualized revenue growth opportunity achievable over the next three years attributed to that focusing on the top left side of bar charts i m delighted to confirm that we achieved an average rate of 250 of vaps value per month across all office units delivered in 2018 this rate is up 26 over the ltm levels achieved the prior year and up 7 from the ltm levels the prior sequential quarter i m particularly pleased with this result as the period includes deliveries to many new customers of the acquired customers you may recall we began offering this solution to acting customers in the second quarter and the modspace customers early in the fourth quarter of 2018 our vaps penetration levels are continuing to increase toward our long term stated goals and as noted before we believe this can provide additional upside over this time horizon now the math behind the 140 million of annualized revenue growth is simple it s simply 123 which is the difference between the 250 of the average for the units delivered last year and 127 which is the average value for all units currently on rent times 12 months times approximately 95 5000 units which are on rent which equals 141 million many of these units on rent were delivered by acquired companies which did not offer a ready to work solution timing of the realization of this opportunity is simply paced by the time it takes for the units which are currently on long term leases to return from their current lease and be reequipped and redeployed increasing vaps penetration will remain a key focus of the business aside from m a the expansion of the ready to work value proposition represents the fastest growing aspect of our business with returns of greater than 40 unlevered irrs this value proposition provides a turnkey solution to our customers affording them the ability to focus on immediately getting on with their work we expect demand for this value proposition to continue to increase over the next several years as we both expand our offering and increase penetration to legacy customers as well as new customers of the acquired businesses turning to slide 10 i d like to provide a snapshot of the key us leasing kpis realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 since they are the primary foundation for the run rate with which we entered 2019 i ll first note that this slide is consistent with the preliminary data we shared during the january update call i m also representing the results on a pro forma basis as this best reflects the underlying trajectory of the business first on the top left chart modular space amr of 563 was up 12 6 year over year in the q4 representing the fifth consecutive quarter of solid double digit rate increases the increase is driven both by expanding vaps penetration and willscot price optimization tools in the left middle chart us modular space utilization was up 290 basis points year over year to 75 3 given our continued focus on rate optimization vaps expansion and capital allocation as we rebalanced the acquired idle fleet and in the lower left chart us modular space units on rent were down a modest 1 in the fourth quarter as the company began executing major integration and fleet rebalancing activities across the branch network as previously mentioned we expect unit on rent to remain down on a year over year basis through the first half of 2019 transitioning to a 1 year over year growth by the end of 2019 our primary focus throughout the integration and the subsequent periods of optimization was and remains first the safety of our colleagues second rate harmonization and optimization third vaps penetration and fourth asset utilization as we look forward to 2019 we continue to see sustained double digit year over year revenue growth on average rental rate as we drive pricing and value added products across the combined portfolio before turning it over to tim i d ask you to turn your attention to slide 11 in order to expand a bit upon our diverse end markets and our robust demand outlook first i d like to direct you to the pie chart in the bottom left of the slide which depicts the further disaggregation of our customer profile our customer database is highly fragmented with no individual customer representing more than 3 of our 2018 revenue and the top 50 customers representing less than 15 of the revenues previously we had presented this customer data aggregated into six end market groups we ve now further disaggregated the construction which are the dark green slices and the commercial and industrial groups which are the black slices in order to highlight the significant diversification underlying the portfolio this data includes the willscot legacy customers by sic code as well as those that have joined us through the recent acquisitions a few highlights at the end market level are first while construction and commercial and industrial end markets collectively represent about 80 of our revenues they re actually comprised of 11 discrete end markets providing for an overall very diverse end market mix second no end market represents more than 17 of our revenues non residential general contractors which is its largest group is actually quite diverse in itself as these customers construction projects are typically serving one of our other discrete end markets and finally energy and natural resource end markets represent only 8 of our revenue and has remained stable over the last several quarters the majority of the revenues from the customers in this end market segment are associated with mid and downstream energy mining and other major utilities which will continue to remain stable as they have for several years less than half of these revenues are associated with upstream oil and gas these upstream markets bottomed several quarters ago following the late 2014 decline in oil prices our 2019 outlook simply assumes these upstream markets remained stable although in the medium to longer term an increase in oil prices would potentially be a catalyst for increased demand overall our demand outlook remains quite positive as we continue to see strength across the diverse end markets i d also like to highlight a few relevant external forecasts and indicators first the american rental association is forecasting a 5 annual revenue growth through 2020 second the aia consensus forecast is generally aligned with 3 to 5 growth over the same period the abi which is architecture billing index which has been a great leading indicator for non risk construction activity looking forward nine months to 18 months was a strong 55 3 in january and has been positive for over 24 months non res construction starts on a square foot basis continues to remain supportive with current levels just near long term average and finally us and canada 2019 gdp forecasts offer growth above 2 while largely not included in our outlook we would expect any substantial us infrastructure spending bills once approved and implemented to further underpin and strengthen many of our diverse end markets based upon this demand outlook we expect our net capex growth related investments to be in the range of 30 million to 60 million in 2019 these investments are highly discretionary and assume continued end market strength and vaps growth as we re currently expecting we will be diligent in maintaining our flexible capital strategy investing to support growth as markets allow and balancing growth with long term returns as a reminder one of the key strengths of our business model is the discretion at which we have over capital spending in the short term coupled with over 30 month average lease duration and long lived assets which together allows us to reduce capital spending and drive free cash flow to the extent markets don t support growth we have a disciplined quarterly process through which we control reassess and allocate our capital with that i ll hand it over to tim who will provide additional context timothy boswell chief financial officer thank you brad please turn to slide 13 q4 was an historic period for our company marking the first full quarter of financial results delivered by the combined willscot and modspace organizations while we did not realize any material cost synergies related to modspace in q4 you can begin to see the organic growth and operating leverage in the combined business which we expect will continue to build each quarter in 2019 in the top charts we show our year over year revenue and ebitda growth as they are reported in our financial statements revenues were up 113 6 and adjusted ebitda was up 103 6 versus prior year obviously in q4 2017 we did not own tyson or modspace and we only owned acton for the last 11 days of the quarter so the bulk of the growth is coming from the full contribution of those acquisitions in q4 2018 and the net result was 73 5 million of adjusted ebitda which as brad said is slightly above the midpoint of the q4 range implied by the annual guidance that we increased in october incorporating modspace while straightforward the top charts reinforce two important points first we ve more than doubled the size of the business in the last 12 months and are entering 2019 on a substantially higher earnings trajectory after seamlessly executing three acquisitions secondly the operating leverage is not immediately obvious because prior to any cost synergy realization both acton and modspace initially were dilutive to margins with contributions to adjusted ebitda of less than 25 margins actually declined 140 basis points on an as reported basis from 30 in q4 2017 to 28 6 in q4 2018 due to this dilution from modspace relative to where our legacy willscot business was operating i ll talk about this a bit more when we go into the us segment results the bottom charts look at revenue and adjusted ebitda on a pro forma basis and they paint a clearer picture of what s going on first overall pro forma revenue growth of 3 appears modest but masks a significant and intentional shift in revenue mix away from equipment sales to reoccurring leasing revenues in our us segment modular leasing revenues are up 18 year over year on a pro forma basis more than offsetting an 18 decline in equipment sales and sales represented only 11 of total revenue in q4 with the remainder coming from our leasing operations this resulted in a 7 million net increase in revenue a 5 3 million increase in adjusted ebitda and 140 basis points of adjusted ebitda margin expansion on a proforma basis again that s with no material cost savings yet coming out of modspace this pro forma view is quite helpful because it demonstrates both the net impact of the revenue mix shift as well as the operating leverage that we expect will become more pronounced as we operate the fully integrated business continuing that point on slide 14 we expect that this mix shift toward higher quality leasing revenue to continue and our organic adjusted ebitda growth to accelerate in 2019 at the midpoint of our guidance ranges we expect total revenues will be up 3 3 with leasing revenues offsetting a 30 million to 50 million decline in sale revenue and adjusted ebitda will increase 24 6 on a pro forma basis at the midpoint you ll recall that modspace executed a hurricane relief project in q3 2018 which generated 30 million of revenue so that accounts for the majority of the expected decline in pro forma sale revenues in 2019 and if i adjust for that the pro forma revenue growth exceeds exceed 6 and adjusted ebitda would be up over 28 organically again at the midpoints i ll again highlight the substantial margin expansion we expect to deliver in 2019 and carry into 2020 while acton and modspace were dilutive to ebitda margins initially relative to our legacy willscot business those deals give us the scale that allows us to expand margins rapidly beyond what any of the companies could have achieved independently we expect adjusted ebitda margins to expand over 500 basis points in 2019 on a proforma basis at the midpoint of our ranges and our target margin of approximately 35 in q4 2019 would be up approximately 640 basis points versus our q4 2018 results relative to the q4 starting point of 28 6 again that s our adjusted ebitda margin in the quarter i d expect some modest expansion quarter to quarter in q1 as cost synergies offset what is typically a softer seasonal quarter from a margin standpoint and then over 100 basis points of expansion each quarter thereafter with the larger quarter to quarter and year over year increases coming in q3 and q4 as we said on our january call as we execute this plan our financial profile shifts significantly with consistent net income generation accelerating free cash flow generation and adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million and margins of 35 heading into 2020 sitting here in march with another eventful quarter behind us our original plan since the announcement of the modspace transaction nine months ago are on track on slide 15 we have our usual reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda while we believe adjusted ebitda is the best indicator of our operating performance we remain bottom line focused and expect to improve that bottom line steadily throughout 2019 while net loss did improve by over 96 million in 2018 versus prior year it was obviously a transitional year to say the least with over 86 million of transaction integration and restructuring costs incurred related to our acquisition and refinancing activity that said as brad mentioned those costs are largely behind us with only 15 million to 20 million of integration and restructuring charges remaining related to modspace and if we look at the right hand column of the reconciliation it s easy to bridge how the business will transition to consistent net profitability after isolating the 30 million of transaction related items in q4 and prior to the realization of any modspace cost synergies or future growth on slide 16 brad already highlighted the fundamental leasing kpis in the us segment in the top left chart our us office fleet on rent increased 129 versus prior year to over 86 000 units primarily due to acquisitions the right hand chart show our results on a pro forma basis as if we had owned acton tyson and modspace in 2017 in the top right utilization is up 290 basis points year over year while average units on rent were basically flat organically through the course of 2018 and down 1 year over year in q4 as we entered january in the bottom right as we ve highlighted for some time average rental rates inclusive of value added products were up 12 6 in q4 representing our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit year over year increases in the us segment as significant as those increases have been we believe that we have multiple levers at our disposal that will allow us to continue this rate growth trend through 2019 while we rationalize our fleet and branch network slide 17 goes into a bit more detail on the us segment revenue and adjusted ebitda performance which is frankly driving the trends that i already discussed at the consolidated level in the top left chart you see q4 revenue growth was up 4 4 versus prior year on a pro forma basis so growing faster organically than the overall consolidated results and in the bottom left chart you see adjusted ebitda on an as reported basis ramping due to our acquisitions organic growth and synergy realization related to acton i ll note you see two consecutive quarters of margin contraction from q2 to q3 to q4 that is entirely expected and due to the inclusion of modspace whose revenues contributed approximately 24 to our adjusted ebitda as i said earlier we expect that trend will reverse in 2019 and head to 35 by q4 2019 as we execute our plans those that were with us last year will recall the exact same phenomenon in q1 of 2018 which you can see in the bottom left chart when margins dipped in the first full quarter after the acton acquisition and then rebounded in q2 before the inclusion of modspace revenue in q3 and q4 so all you re seeing in q4 is the revenue weighted average margin of two recently combined businesses prior to synergy realization now with the integration complete we expect those margins will climb to 35 by q4 2019 moving to slide 18 we ll look at our other north america segment which includes operations in canada alaska and mexico we are again showing pro forma metrics for this segment denoted by the white boxes since modspace roughly doubled our presence in canada as we talked about last quarter the other north america segment bottomed in 2018 on a pro forma basis due to the long runoff of upstream oil and gas projects primarily in alberta and alaska resulting from our three year average lease durations and some specific modspace projects that completed in the first half of 2018 average rental rates in the top right chart have essentially been range bound on a pro forma basis for three years and average units on rent in the bottom right chart have been flat for four consecutive quarters with utilization up 80 basis points year over year so we believe these markets have found their supply demand equilibrium and we are seeing modest improvements in canada alaska and mexico as we head into 2019 slide 19 reiterates our expectations for free cash flow in 2019 and is useful to illustrate how those sources and uses of cash change as we head into 2020 with an adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million in 2019 with our current debt structure and maintenance capex requirements we see 130 million to 150 million of free cash flow prior to growth investments that s in the green bar in the middle of the page and that number pushes toward 200 million based on the expected 2020 run rate based on current market conditions new order activity and tremendous traction on value added products we expect to invest at least 30 million of the discretionary growth capex on value added products and we ll evaluate the remaining growth investments as we get deeper into q2 as we shared in january we expect the integration and restructuring costs to be front loaded in 2019 such that we are cash generative in the second half of the year with an accelerating run rate heading into 2020 this is all consistent with what we discussed in january although we have the benefit of our final q4 results and two additional months of performance here in 2019 moving to slide 20 these are the december 31st debt balances that we provided to you in january we remain very comfortable with the flexibility we have to manage the debt structure particularly in light of the cash flow dynamics i just discussed approximately 70 of the debt structure is fixed rate after taking into account the interest rate swap we put in place in november so we see limited interest rate exposure with some clear opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of debt which is currently approximately 6 6 we have no debt maturities prior to 2022 yet we do have flexibility to repay debt at every level in the debt structure so we have good optionality around how we delever the business in time we drew approximately 23 million on the abl in the quarter to fund 42 million of net capex as well as cash restructuring interest costs and we had 533 million of liquidity in the abl revolver as of december 31st and we ll report 4 6 times leverage to our bank group in q4 based on the definitions in our credit agreement our target leverage range remains 3 times to 4 times as we said in january we expect to achieve the high end of that range organically by q2 2020 assuming current market conditions and a full capital expenditure plan and this is perfectly comfortable given the visibility we have into the earnings growth in the business and the speed with which we can adjust capital spending if we so choose to accelerate the deleveraging the combination of 30 month average lease durations underpinning our lease revenue and a 90 day capital planning cycle create this flexibility in managing our discretionary free cash flow we have some new material for you on slide 21 our business model has always been very efficient from a cash tax standpoint and you will see approximately 2 6 million of cash taxes paid in 2018 in our 10 k aside from that we reported 38 6 million gaap tax benefit which is non cash and approximately 20 7 million of that was due to our final adjustments related to the 2017 tax act there is a detailed reconciliation of our effective tax rate in the 10 k however barring any changes in tax policy or major transaction activity we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24 to 27 range for gaap purposes in june 2018 when we announced the modspace transaction we noted approximately 50 million of net present value from expected tax benefits i m pleased to report that we ve completed our initial section 382 analysis and we have 936 million of gross us federal nols as of december 31 2018 in addition we have gross deferred tax assets of 557 million related to the section 163 j interest deductions and 50 million from prior capital losses with which we can shield future taxable income and gains in the us these assets offer valuable optionality and we expect will shield any meaningful us federal income taxes for approximately five years to seven years the cash taxes that you see in our cash flow statement are largely state and local in nature and we ve been in a net refund position in canada in recent years my last comment on this page before turning it back to brad the pace and complexity of transaction activity over that past 18 months has been quite high and you ll recall we had identified a material internal control weakness in 2017 specifically related to accounting for income taxes in the context of reverse acquisitions those transactions don t happen every day and while we did take on some additional complex transactions in 2018 i m pleased to affirm that we had no such weaknesses or deficiencies in 2018 this is a testament to some relentless efforts behind the scenes by our team a belt and suspenders remediation plan that we executed throughout the year as well as our preparation for large accelerated filer status in 2019 these are critical milestones as we build the best in class specialty rental services platform in north america with that i ll hand it back to brad on slide 23 for his closing comments and q a bradley soultz chief executive officer thanks tim in closing we delivered on our commitments last year and we expect to do the same into the future we have a simple three ingredient recipe to deliver the 345 million to 365 million adjusted ebitda organically in 2019 while deleveraging this business ingredient one is already in place given we ve completed the modspace integration ingredient two is to deliver the 70 million associated cost synergies and ingredient three is to harmonize and further optimize rate utilization in vaps we re extremely proud of all that we accomplished in 2018 which provides the foundation for a great future we are very confident in our 2019 outlook and in achieving the resulting adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million with ebitda margins expanding to 35 all while being generating substantial discretionary free cash flow as we exit 2019 these accelerating earnings and the inherent cash flow characteristics of our platform provide confidence that by the second quarter of 2020 we expect to be at or below the 4x net debt to ebitda level in line with our target levels we appreciate now that you ve taken the time to join us today and for your interest in our company we look forward to speaking with many of you very soon that concludes our prepared remarks and we now would be happy to take your questions operator please open the line questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from manav patnaik of barclays your line is open manav patnaik barclays analyst hi good morning guys i guess we ve been through a lot of the financial stuff and so the main question i had for you guys was just around the macro update so you had one deck where you had those i guess the aia consensus forecast and i guess it shows it s almost halving in 2020 and so i guess i was just wondering how do you plan today if you do follow this forecast how do you plan today for the slowdowns and all the different moving pieces if you could just maybe help us understand that better would be helpful timothy boswell chief financial officer you can start with maybe the current macro outlook bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer and i can talk about our response plan bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah so first of all the macro level this is brad our outlook remains quite robust i mean if we look at our quoting activity which we monitor on a weekly basis which is a great indication of inquiries combined with these external forecast all are supportive of continued growth i think just as a reminder i referenced our quarterly capital allocation process whereby we look at this demand on a frequent basis and adjust capital accordingly and i ll ask tim to expand a bit up on that timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah manav i think when i think about this i use kind of slide 19 the free cash flow bridge as a bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer framework with which to think about this and sitting here today as we think about the outlook for 2019 it s hard to see a macro event kind of disrupting the run rate and the trajectory that the business is on so we re kind of looking a bit further into the future as brad said the abi being a great indicator of nine months to 12 months out of future non res construction starts on a square footage which in turn correspond to our delivery volumes we don t see an immediate red flag from a volume perspective barring the disruption that we ve incurred related to the integrations so looking into 2020 what s the plan as we monitor all of our leading indicators quoting activity on the ground being the primary indicator brad mentioned you ll recall we re on a quarterly capital planning cycle and you can see where the capital investments in the business are going in 2019 and that s probably not a bad guidepost to use for 2016 and going forward so i think in any macro environment manav we continue to invest in the value added products and services program we believe that opportunity is really just based on the penetration of our assets not on macro factors so i d expect we continue to fund that growth irrespective of market environment and that will frankly insulate a part of the business along with our three year lease durations from any change in macro conditions that gives you a lot of time then to respond with other fleet investments so you can quite easily pull back on the additional 30 million of growth investments in the fleet and a substantial portion of what we call the maintenance capex manav patnaik barclays analyst yeah bradley soultz chief executive officer can be reduced as well in a declining volume environment we define maintenance capex as the investment level required in a volume neutral market environment so if markets support growth like we think they will in 2019 we d invest above that level and if markets are contracting we can cut that capex and dramatically increase the free cash flow coming out of the business this is a unique dynamic that s fairly unique to our business model and gets us very comfortable with both the capital structure and the outlook manav patnaik barclays analyst got it and just a quick follow up and then i ll hop off it s internally do you see any leading indicators or is it just more of the macro stuff that we all end up seeing that causes you to start acting differently bradley soultz chief executive officer no i think it s there obviously there has been some disruptions in the capital and equity markets and kind of so global concerns but as far as demand at the end market level it remains robust i mean as tim mentioned it s our job to watch it like a hawk and we do if we see things softening if we were to see that we swiftly pull back capital and shift the platform such that we re increasing the free cash flow but circling back to your point i m not seeing anything now that cause me concern in the end markets we have worked through substantial fleet rebalancing and branch consolidation and as i noted before our priority is keep folks safe and drive rates right and increase utilization and as volume opportunities are presented we re very selective about the ones we take manav patnaik barclays analyst okay thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from kevin mcveigh of credit suisse your line is open kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst great thanks hey just help us understand what gave you the confidence to boost the vaps i think it was around 125 million you re going up to 140 million and is there any way to think about what the acceptance rate embedded in that 140 million is bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah the difference if you ll remember kevin last time we published that was a quarter ago kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst yeah bradley soultz chief executive officer that ltm rate was i want to say 234 million from memory right so it s simply continued increased penetration that we realized through the fourth quarter when we put our preliminary results out right we were still consolidating two modspace and willscot systems so we were maybe a little more cautious there but if you can tell i m quite bullish on this i m extremely proud of the fact that we expanded that ltm delivered rate through three acquisitions so i think that s great testament not only to platform but the team that s driving it kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst great and then tim just if you wanted to kind of buy that four turns leverage kind of q2 2020 what could you get it to if you kind of drive it to in a tougher scenario if you wanted to buy by the end of 2020 likely not even macro just you would have kind of focused more on deleveraging as opposed to anything else where do you think you get that leverage to timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah there are too many potential scenarios to give you a specific target kevin so suffice to say could be lower and i would use the capital spending in the business as the primary lever that we would pull between now and q2 of 2020 to influence that number level lower like i said in response to the previous question i don t see as much risk around the run rate from an ebitda standpoint just based on the lease durations in the portfolio so capex would be the primary variable and by sensitizing capex you could sensitize leverage in q2 of 2020 kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst got it and then just quickly is there any kind of meaningful difference in the average lease cap lease duration for modspace versus willscot in the core business bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah it did pull us down slightly i d say some of this is how we measure our data so i don t think there is a fundamental difference in the two portfolios we reported a 30 month average lease duration most recently in a year ago we would have been talking about 35 month average lease duration across portfolio we see no real change in terms of if you compare like for like contracts or transactions rather in terms of the ultimate lease durations so we ll keep an eye on it as the portfolios harmonize if you recall the biggest difference between the modspace fleet and the willscot fleet is that modspace had a slightly higher mix of complexes these are the buildings that we coupled together to make larger square footage installations and those are actually tend to have longer lease durations than the smaller single wide units for example that we acquired from acton kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst got it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from sean wondrack of deutsche bank your line is open sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst hey guys and congratulations on completing the integration bradley soultz chief executive officer thanks sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst so just touching on a couple of things in the end markets it s great to hear the robust outlook there are couple of things that i ve sort of heard i had a company reduced guidance this morning based on weather that sort of impacted construction also we had the government shutdown can you comment on both of them and has that really impacted your business or is there anything else sort of holding you back and that you can think about in q1 bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah i would say there has been a bit of weather anomaly this year it s not something that concerns me because five years in the business it s not unusual i would say it s been more broad spread throughout both canada and the us and as mentioned i mean what it typically means is maybe a delay in a month or two of project starting our inquiries or quotes remain very robust frankly above our targets for the combined portfolio so yeah it is factual i think there has been a bit of impact on new activations associated with that but i think we re talking about weeks and months here not something that gives me concern we left the first we left the fourth quarter down a modest 1 if you think about that fourth quarter maybe half to two thirds of it was pretty significantly impacted by these modspace branch consolidation and reallocation if you remember that started in november and then that activity kind of continued heavily into the first quarter so i think as commented before we expect to be down unit on rent through the first half and then slowly bringing that back to up a modest 1 at the end of the year sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst great timothy boswell chief financial officer it s also safe to say we re reiterating our guidance today so whatever softness you see on the volume side we see opportunity on pricing in value added products sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst great fair enough and with government being roughly 3 of your overall demand did you see any impact from the shutdown and then you also mentioned some of these discrete end market opportunities obviously the immigration issue has been a very politically charged issue but if you can kind of comment on what you re seeing through boots on the ground there would be helpful bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah we didn t really see anything on the government side at all good or bad i guess if you will and these kind of discrete end market opportunities first i d characterize this is a very broad portfolio across mexico us and canada so at any one time there is usually one or two of those going on somewhere right and typically as those events occur we ll see a surge in demand and certainly a surge in sustained pricing one of the more recent national issues the wildfires in california i think the infrastructure plans are just finalized that that business has just been awarded for the rebuild and we expect to experience some benefits of that but then just again keep in mind that s one little small piece of a very broad portfolio here so kind of ebbs and flows over time if you will sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst great i ll ask one more and i ll get back in queue just regarding your current capital structure you outlined your goals you ve been basically hitting all of the goals that you ve outlined some of your debt is shorter term do you foresee there being sort of a global refi in the next few years as you move on to the next stage of your growth bradley soultz chief executive officer look we ll undertake all that opportunistically sean it s hard to sit here today and say yes we re absolutely going to refi everything so what i like about the debt structure specifically is in the meantime setting aside any global refinancing you ve got a handful of tactical things you could do flexibility to pay down at every tranche in the debt structure and given our free cash profile is shifting dramatically in the second half of this year and heading into 2020 i think we ll definitely start with those tactical opportunities and be opportunistic as it relates to everything else sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst okay great thank you i ll turn it over operator thank you our next question comes from ashish sabadra with deutsche bank your line is open ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst hey brad thanks for providing all the details a quick question about the vaps monthly rate of 250 million sorry 250 on an ltm basis can you do you provide what the penetration rate for vaps was there and maybe any color on what the average vaps monthly rate is right now ongoing bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah so we do not provide specific penetration guidance i think the 250 is if you think about dollars per unit it s the best reflection of penetration we have characterized that that 200 to 250 level represents about a 40 furniture penetration meaning of 100 units we shipped in the period 40 were fully equipped with furniture and 60 weren t and that increase in penetration over time is what s really driving that increase in value we ve stated that our internal target is to drive that penetration to 80 over the next several years and as noted i m pretty encouraged about the progress through these acquisitions and the early adoption of the new customers timothy boswell chief financial officer ashish this is tim ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst okay that s great yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer in response to the second part of your question which is the overall average if you look at slide nine in the top left chart our delivered rate on contracts in the last 12 months is 250 of recurring monthly revenue per unit per month and the overall portfolio average is the 127 that you see next to it so what s interesting here is the 127 is actually down slightly bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer and that is due to the dilution from acton and modspace because they do not have as robust of a value added products program so you actually have the overall portfolio average that has contracted slightly due to the acquisition dilution we ve continued to push the delivered rates therefore the spread between delivered rates and the overall portfolio widened resulting in the higher revenue potential number that brad articulated ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst that s extremely helpful and my yeah so i guess as you continue to improve penetration what i was wondering was that there could be potential upside to even that 250 number on the monthly run rate as the penetration continues to improve but maybe my next question was around margins tim and you laid out the 35 margins in the fourth quarter of 2019 as we think about going forward there are still opportunities like for further cost synergies as well as the pricing and vaps those are higher margin businesses so the right way to think about it is that further upside to that 35 margins in the out years timothy boswell chief financial officer yes bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer we believe there is opportunity on the cost synergy slide that brad talked about in the bottom left hand corner there is a list of very logical projects that we are undertaking that could certainly contribute to future margin expansion if we rewind a year and a half ago when we were first marketing williams scotsman to the spec we did present an ebitda margin bridge that went up to 38 bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer based on it was illustrative but yes we have from the outset of this journey had line of sight to higher margins ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst that s great congrats once again on solid results operator thank you and our next question comes from phil ng of jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys you ve seen really strong momentum on amr do you expect that double digit run rate to be sustainable in 2019 just based on the updated vaps opportunity alone it kind of implies about mid single digit lift annually so just curious how you re thinking about for like for like pricing and any other mix dynamics we should be appreciative of timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah that s exactly what we expect it s consistent with the january update we gave and you re right value added products will continue to be driving at least half of that year over year improvement bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer as you think about what other levers we have to manage pricing just on the modules themselves we obviously we ve got the upfront rental rates which have been supportive you ll recall that an average contract that we signed last for about 11 months but ends up staying on rent 30 months on average so you ve got flexibility to manage rates during that intervening period and we ve been rolling out the price optimization platform across the combined volume of the willscot acton and modspace portfolio so you ve got really four different levers right now that we re managing in order to drive absolute rate improvement phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s really helpful and just on that note how has the new sales force from modspace transitioned away from maybe how they approached pricing or rate optimization and then the upselling piece for vaps have you kind of provided any new training for the new sales force and has that resonated well i m just curious this new customer base that you have via acquired assets have has vaps resident in a similar fashion for them as well bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah phil this is brad i d say that was a pleasant find once we were under the hood with modspace so first of all well there were redundant or overlapping sales rep between william scotsman and modspace we obviously focused on the best talent and generally it was about a 50 50 selection the modspace team had begun to implement the same rate optimization tools that scotsman was deploying and had begun to offer furniture through a third party lease release so i would say it was already well within their behaviors and their mindset we did have an all sales and operations joint session back in october of last year where we really focused everyone on the william scotsman operating platform and then significant training on our tools and processes and we continue to follow that so long and short of it is they ve been great adopters and adapters they ve already started on that journey i m very pleased with the progress and i m sure that s contributing to the increase in vaps that we spoke about earlier phil ng jefferies analyst got it and just one last one for me tim appreciated you provided some of that color on the free cash flow run rate exiting 2020 of 200 million obviously the which is a nice acceleration the other piece i just want to make sure if you could help us frame up is just the discretionary spend associated with that whether it s capex and what s left on the restructuring front we should be mindful of thanks timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah so on the free cash flow bridge the assumptions i m making that get to a 200 million this is directional discretionary free cash flow number some improvement on our overall cost of debt combined with the 400 million ebitda run rate and then the capex assumption for 2020 sitting here today i d say use the 2019 guidance as directional guidance for the foreseeable future in this market environment so does that answer your question phil phil ng jefferies analyst with the discretionary piece was there anything that we need to be mindful of because you gave maintenance capex and i guess the growth capex piece i guess we could kind of flush out whatever you guided for 2019 is there anything else that we should be thoughtful of in terms of like restructuring spend that in the discretionary ph bradley soultz chief executive officer no as you get into 2020 we expect that all the restructuring costs on a cash basis to be incurred in this view you do if you just think about our cash flow statement you have the gross profit associated with our rental unit sales so just make sure you re capturing that piece if you re starting with ebitda as the starting point for your bridge but other than that no we expect the integration restructuring to have been completed from a cash standpoint barring any other transaction activity phil ng jefferies analyst okay all right so that s a pretty solid number that s really nice acceleration appreciate the color thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from scott schneeberger of oppenheimer your line is open scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks good morning and congratulations guys on executing very well in 2018 first question for me could you please discuss the drivers of the 12 6 rental rate growth in the fourth quarter in terms of core rate repricing acquired assets and perhaps growth and then tim how might you think about the composition going forward thanks timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah scott we talked about this a little bit in january in rough numbers approximately 60 of the percentage growth in q4 was coming from the base rates and the remainder was coming from the value added products opportunity and like i think roughly 50 50 mix as you go through 2019 is a reasonable assumption and we are managing those a bit independently so if one take it the way the other may give it a bit bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst understand thanks and then just could you discuss the expected cadence of adjusted ebitda over the quarters of 2019 and perhaps elaborate on some seasonal dynamics it was touched upon earlier but obviously you have a bit of a sporadic history with acquisitions latent in there so just a little bit of thought of the cadence this year would be great help thanks bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah i mean my comments earlier were around the pace of the margin expansion obviously we haven t been giving quarterly guidance but appreciate that there has been a fair amount of change in the portfolio so it s a good question as you go from q4 and what we re at 28 6 adjusted ebitda margin in q4 i d expect some modest expansion going into q1 which in prior years would be a little unusual usually q1 is a bit lower from a margin perspective so what we have going on is that usual seasonal weakness from a margin standpoint as your variable costs start to ramp up heading into q2 but it s offset by cost synergy realization that will be generated from really all of the acton synergies as well as the beginning of the modspace synergies then that margin percentage expansion should expand by as i said about 100 basis points quarter to quarter with the larger improvements happening in q3 and q4 so those margin percentages and we saw this in q4 scott for example can be impacted pretty significantly by sale volume so that s probably the primary variable that can change things quarter to quarter but when you look at the kind of the core underlying leasing gross margin which is where we have the bulk of our management time and attention is focused that doesn t surprise us as much scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst all right thanks yeah i appreciate that tim very helpful thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from sean wondrack of deutsche bank your line is open sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst hey guys just one more quick one from me could you comment on the m a environment if you re seeing any other opportunities there and kind of what you re seeing there please bradley soultz chief executive officer i mean we obviously can t comment about specifics but i think i characterized on the last call with the modspace integration behind us we have the capability and the capacity to make further acquisitions we ve also consistently said we re not going to over pay and we re not going to over lever so coming back to our primary focus right now that the modspace system integrations are complete is harvest the 70 million in cost synergies drive this vaps growth potential and delever the platform back into the 4x range so we ve got the capability and capacity to do it we re not compelled to do it and we re not going to over pay and we re not going to increase leverage sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you i d like to turn the call back over to mr brad soultz for closing comments bradley soultz chief

roosevelt s clash with the courts in the 1930s anticipated the anti democratic tendencies in the post 1945 evolution of the rule of law by appealing to the sanctity of the rule of law juridified institutions can see themselves as justified in overruling the wishes of the people expressed through popular votes and elections the responsibility of governments to act on their electoral mandates is devalued by insisting on their overriding responsibility to the rule of law look at this typical formulation from the then united nations secretary general kofi annan who earlier this millenium defended a principle of governance in which all persons institutions and entities public and private including the state itself are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated equally enforced and independently adjudicated and which are consistent with international human rights norms and standards again on the surface this does not sound overtly undemocratic the institutions of government should be bound by the rule of law governments should not be free to flout laws that apply to others but another essential democratic principle is that governments should be accountable to their electorate the laws to be followed should be those that the people agree with if enough do not vote for them or subsequently disagree with them they can replace the government and change the laws at the next election this relationship is at best blurred or even subverted when non elected un officials assert that the law they want to be followed by governments has to be in accord with certain international standards when those often vague and imprecise international norms and standards are given an effective veto over domestic legislation people s decision making capacities are being overridden in principle even if not always in practice moreover this perspective on the rule of law where government actions need to meet certain internationally set criteria has already legitimated international intervention in the affairs of sovereign states many nations have been invaded because of claims they were in breach of the law including in recent times somalia serbia iraq libya and syria as the historian mark mazower observed the appeal to law has become a vocabulary of permissions a means of asserting power and control that normalises the debatable and justifies the exception 8 the increasing use of the rule of law to validate the erosion of national sovereignty is part of the broader reimagining of the postwar international order insofar as postwar international institutions are increasingly attributed authority over national governments their elevation above popular sovereignty endows them with a hallowed and almost enchanted power public responses from many globalists to trump s well known disregard and hostility to these organisations have made such opinions more explicit a collection of international relations scholars argued for preserving the existing international order against some of trump s anti globalist outbursts in a statement published in the new york times 27 july 2018 they claimed that the un nato the wto the eu and other postwar institutions have provided economic stability and international security and had brought about unprecedented levels of prosperity and the longest period in modern history without war between major powers giving so much clout to international institutions turns a wish into a false reality we can never know if peace in the sense of avoiding war between the major nations since 1945 would have happened without these institutions because there is only one history however these institutions ultimately only express the forces and pressures of the nations that make them up in themselves the institutions cannot do anything when powerful member states ignore them the league of nations for instance failed to prevent the second world war not because of some institutional defect but because capitalist nations were on a collision course moulded by the economic and geopolitical conflicts of the time the league of nations was powerless to prevent these another international relations expert stephen walt from harvard not only declined to sign that new york times statement he also challenged its assumptions he explained that these institutions were set up in a different era from the present most he suggested were no longer appropriate for today s world walt cautioned that nostalgia for a past that never existed would not help to address contemporary issues the so called liberal order was not quite the nirvana that people now imagine it was walt showed this was never a fully global order there was also an awful lot of illiberal behaviour going on even by countries and leaders who constantly proclaimed liberal values the us he reminded his colleagues has propped up plenty of authoritarian illiberal rulers throughout the cold war and has continued to do so since a more recent disdain for international rules came when the us led the invasion of iraq in 2003 without un approval white house administrations have not hesitated to break the rules of the liberal order in order to follow their national interests this is what happened when the us unilaterally dismantled the bretton woods currency exchange system in 1971 because it could no longer follow the rules it had earlier approved domestic interests simply assumed greater importance for the us than continuing its core commitment to the international monetary system walt went on to point out that some of the institutions being defended today are actually a source of the trouble we face he gave the example of nato established in a different era to coordinate western military power during the cold war walt said that since the end of the cold war nato has turned into a disruptive force its pursuit of an open ended and ill conceived eastward expansion has rekindled international tensions not assuaged them endowing these institutions with a supreme power is not only misleading it is also corrosive to democracy promoting unelected international institutional authority undermines accountable national authority citizens diminished role in decision making is reinforced when we are told that international organisations are the real peacemakers and the true engineers of prosperity the supposed omnipotence of these bodies gives them an almost holy status this is why just criticising them can appear sacrilegious to some globalists anti nation state but not anti statist globalism is often perceived as a natural corollary to a more globalised economy it seems likely that the growing interdependence of national economies since the late 19th century was a necessary basis for the emergence of globalism but it was not a sufficient one how did its ideas become so powerful returning to greenspan s statement from 2007 three points are pertinent first it captures the fatalist ethos of globalism it hardly makes any difference who will be the next president the world is governed by market forces the implication is that since nation states do not control anything there is little we can do to influence things by voting it is the market that determines our circumstances second the statement is especially significant because of who made it until his retirement a few months earlier greenspan had been regularly feted as the most powerful man in the world he was speaking before the financial crisis hit when his reputation and that of central bankers generally became somewhat tarnished we have the irony of the former leader of the world s most powerful central bank highlighting powerlessness in the face of globalisation that counter position between the establishment s levers of real power and the claim of impotence is not an incidental paradox of globalism it is intrinsic to it and third greenspan s central european heritage is not unimportant to the history of globalism even if in his case he is a second generation exponent greenspan was born in new york in the 1920s living first in its washington heights district this was known at the time as frankfurt on the hudson because of its large number of jewish immigrants from germany his parents were actually of central european descent his father romanian his mother hungarian greenspan s lineage is relevant because of the important influence of classic neoliberalism on the development of globalist thinking two narratives about globalism can be read into greenspan s statement the standard and most popular narrative is of globalism as the twin of neoliberalism expressing the market fundamentalist view that state intervention is bad for the economy the government interferes too much with the self regulating power of free markets and therefore undermines prosperity this perspective explains why greenspan regarded it as fortunate that globalisation was rendering national government redundant we call this the anti state narrative

in the wake of a historically dreadful shooting in new zealand one of the statistically safest countries in the world you would be forgiven for thinking that financial markets would be reeling from the horror of seeing 49 people gunned down nz is not the united states in terms of gun violence the last time that more than ten people died in a shooting was 1990 nearly 20 years ago instead there was an apparent bout of risk on with major us indices like the dow jones and nasdaq rising sharply on the day one area where analysts did believe the terrorist attack had an impact was in the gold price with a couple of reports suggesting that the bounce back above 1 300 was a direct result of the massacre analysts new zealand shooting sent gold price higher first chintan karnani chief market analyst at insignia consultants said new zealand news is positively supporting gold brexit uncertainty is also supporting gold prices next naeem aslam strategist at thinkmarkets uk said the attacks over in new zealand has stunned the markets investors are seeking shelter under safe haven assets new zealand terrorist attack wasn t gold s primary driver well i m sorry to be unkind but that is very much not the case perhaps there was a small amount of temporary noise from the terrorist attack but this was a tiny fundamental you have to look at correlations between asset classes to gauge what is moving the markets today we saw higher stocks higher metal prices a weaker dollar and lower oil prices all these issues point to falling yields in bonds nothing more gold might like chaos but it loves a weaker usd more mainly because it trades around the world in dollars what may have confused some investors was seeing the haven japanese yen jpy rising against the dollar however looking at a cross section of g10 currencies it is evident that the moves are almost identical in usd denominated majors this eradicates the argument for haven flows dow futures boom as trump admin clambers to rescue china trade deal ccn capital celeb news capitalandceleb march 15 2019 other than stock markets the australian dollar was telling the real story up 0 35 against its us counterpart the aussie was solidifying that friday was about china developments and nothing else the new zealand dollar of all the currencies should have been lower but it too rose domestic terrorism has less and less impact on financial markets i wish financial markets still cared about domestic terrorism but they just don t new zealand france the uk and america are all suffering from high terror alerts but local stock markets barely blink even the world changing 9 11 attack stock losses were erased within a few months as noted by gideon rachman writing for the financial times in the first week of trading after the terror attacks of september 11 the dow jones fell 14 per cent but the dow and the nasdaq recovered their pre 9 11 levels within months of the attacks why is this the case well it could be because machines do most of the trading and the decisions are less emotional mr rachman makes a compelling example of this from another quote where he questions whether political risk affects a billionaire s investment outlook i was having coffee with one of the other speakers a celebrated private equity investor and asked him how much he thought about geopolitical risk hardly at all he replied we look at the companies the cash flows the investments themselves gold is a commodity not a true haven i can go further in looking at how gold behaves more as a commodity than a haven if you look at the height of financial turmoil in 2008 when it looked like the world was ending gold fell in value along with everything else people incorrectly look at its subsequent rally as fear based but it was really because gold loves low interest rates and tends to drop when interest rates move higher even that correlation is struggling of late i love that gold drops and equities pop when ecb announces tltro iii the scenario the gold bugs feared massive reckless aggressive global cb intervention happened over the past decade yet every asset except gold has risen in price takethehint dyingasset dow mark_dow march 7 2019 take a look at the cftc cot report and the smartest money in the gold business continues to hedge against depreciation in the price commercials have been majority short sellers of gold for many years now in fact hedging in general might be the best use of gold rather than an investment new zealand should have had an effect on haven demand i wish that markets were more fearful of domestic terrorism like we saw in new zealand it might go some way to sparking politicians into really addressing the implications of their actions unfortunately to suggest that gold was seeing extra demand because of a mass shooting in an isolated economy is just flat out incorrect disclaimer the views expressed in the article are solely those of the author and do not represent those of nor should they be attributed to ccn com

call over to brad bradley soultz chief executive officer thanks matt and welcome everyone to willscot s fourth quarter and full year 2018 conference call first turn to slide 3 i d like to provide a brief overview of the company given that we have new investors and analysts joining us today as a specialty rental service market leader our mission is to provide innovative modular space and portable storage solutions we focus on providing these solutions ready to work so that our customers can forget about the space focus on what they do best working their project being productive and meeting their goals we now provide these solutions to more than 50 000 customers with a fleet of over 150 000 units which represent over 75 million square feet of temporary space through an unparalleled branch network of over 120 locations across the us canada and mexico when we deliver an immediately functional space productivity is all our customers see this value proposition is unique in the industry our customers including those new to us through recent acquisitions are embracing it and it s driving our growth if you ll turn to slide four our strategy has been to accelerate our already strong organic growth with accretive m a just over a year ago we committed to doubling the company without overpaying or over leveraging i m pleased to report that we ve delivered on that commitment as evident in our fourth quarter 2018 revenue and adjusted ebitda which were up 114 and 104 respectively year over year in summary we delivered on our commitments last year and we expect to continue to do the same into the future we delivered 216 million of adjusted ebitda in the full year 2018 which is slightly above the midpoint of our increased 2018 guidance which we issued in october of 2018 and reaffirmed in january looking forward we believe we have a simple recipe to deliver the 345 million to 365 million of adjusted ebitda organically in 2019 all the while delevering the business importantly we believe this outlook is largely within management s control due to the substantial cost synergies and organic earnings growth potential embedded in this portfolio i d like to now point out five attributes underpinning this unique and fast growing specialty rental services platform first we have significant revenue visibility given the trajectory at which we exited 2018 the 30 month average lease durations and the embedded growth from pricing and vaps initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2018 our average monthly modular rental rates in our us segment were 12 6 up on a year over year basis this result is the same as the preliminary result included in our january investor update call this represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit rate growth and we expect this momentum to continue as we look ahead on the ready to work side this value proposition continues to increase in penetration if we simply continue to deliver new units at the current level of vaps penetration we will realize a greater than 140 million revenue opportunity over the next three years as units which are currently on rent return are reequipped and redeployed this represents a 15 million increase over the preliminary results communicated in our january investor update call our vaps penetration levels are continuing to increase toward our longer term stated goals which we believe could provide additional upside over this time horizon we ll share additional context on this important new development a bit later in the call second the modspace system integration is complete we ve now fully transitioned to realization of the 70 million of cost synergies attributed to the prior acquisitions i remind 80 of these cost synergies are expected to be included in our fourth quarter 2019 run rate and we expect 90 of the associated costs to realize these synergies to be expensed in the first half of 2019 with the related cash payments completed by q4 third we have an accelerating adjusted ebitda growth and margin expansion we expect to achieve an adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million with ebitda margins expanding to 35 as we exit 2019 fourth we have substantial cash flow generation due to the discretionary nature of our capital expenditures at the midpoint of our 2019 guidance we expect free cash flow to be 140 million before growth capex and one time costs associated with realizing these cost synergies as previously noticed noted we expect 90 of these cash payments to be completed by q4 of 2019 assuming we achieve our objective of 400 million adjusted ebitda run rate our discretionary free cash flow generation will be approaching 200 million annualized rate as we exit 2019 and fifth our net income and free cash flow generation in the second half of 2019 accelerates our deleveraging into 2020 these accelerating earnings and the inherent cash flow characteristics of our platform provide confidence that by the second quarter of 2020 we expect to be at or below the 4x net debt to adjusted ebitda which is in line with our target net leverage range of 3 times to 4 times in summary we remain committed to our goal of creating long term shareholder value and are extremely excited about our future we re confident in this outlook and believe achieving a run rate of 400 million adjusted ebitda exiting 2019 is well within management s control all while delevering the business now if i turn to slide five there is no other company that has the scope scale turnkey capability and service commitment to deliver like we do for the combined business on a proforma basis our 2018 revenues were just over 1 billion and our adjusted ebitda would have been 285 million this is inclusive of our three acquisitions acton tyson and modspace as if we own them for the entire period approximately 90 of our revenues are generated in the us serving a very diverse group of end markets and over 90 of our adjusted gross profit is derived from our recurring leasing business beyond our substantial scale advantage there are three key attributes that really differentiate william scotsman first ready to work we ve repositioned the business strategically with this unique value proposition through the expansion of our offering of value added products and services or vaps our customers value it and is driving our growth with highly accretive returns second we have a differentiated and scalable operating platform over the past several years we ve invested in our people processes and technology and created a highly scalable and differentiated operating platform capable of asserting market leadership this operating platform includes sophisticated price management capital allocation characteristics we have leveraged this platform to swiftly and efficiently integrate acquired companies third we have very attractive unit economics which provide a high degree of visibility into future performance you ll recall over 90 of our adjusted gross profit is derived from our recurring leasing business which is underpinned by long lived assets typically 20 plus years coupled with average lease durations of 30 months now i ll direct you to slide six in a little over one year we ve doubled the size of the company by leveraging the unique willscot operating platform to further accelerate the already strong organic growth with highly accretive m a as depicted in the boxes above the arrow our ebitda has continued to accelerate since late november of last year when we recapitalized the company and returned to the public markets the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda of 216 million is up 74 on a year over year basis and is just above the midpoint of our revised 2018 guidance issued last october our fourth quarter 2018 revenues of 257 million and adjusted ebitda of 74 million which are up 114 and 104 respectively year over year better reflect the underlying business as this was the first full quarter that we own modspace during the same period across the bottom we joined the russell 2000 all while making and integrating three acquisitions our execution of the modspace commercial operational and systems integration on budget and earlier than schedule enables us to begin to realize the 70 million of annualized cost synergies and over 140 million of annualized vaps related revenue growth potential as a part of this journey we ve combined forces with three outstanding peer companies and hundreds of talented people that are committed to bring our customers an expanded fleet of ready to work solutions tremendous effort has gone into safely and efficiently integrating these companies and i m extremely proud of the team and their accomplishments now as we turn to slide seven i d like to highlight the 2019 adjusted ebitda guidance that we reaffirmed via press release last night while tim will take you through the full 2019 financial guidance in more detail i d like to highlight our adjusted ebitda expectations we have a very simple recipe to deliver the 345 million to 365 million adjusted ebitda organically in 2019 while delevering the business first ingredient one is already in place given we ve completed the modspace systems integration the second ingredient is to deliver the 70 million of associated cost synergies and third ingredient ph is to harmonize and further optimize rate utilization and vaps we are excited about the full year 2019 outlook and in particular the resulting adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million with ebitda margins of 35 generating substantial discretionary free cash flow as we exit 2019 importantly we believe this outlook is largely within our control we delivered on our commitments last year and we expect to do the same going forward turning to slide eight i d like to just expand upon the aforementioned cost synergies related to the acquisitions with the modspace system integration complete we ve transitioned to cost synergy realization these integrations required no changes to the willscot operating platform consistent with prior acquisitions and a further testament to the scalability of the platform there are over 70 million of annualized cost synergies associated with the acquisitions over 80 of these cost synergies are expected to be included in our fourth quarter run rate as mentioned before the balance executed in 2020 and approximately 60 of these cost synergies are related to redundant headcount with a balance split between branch real estate consolidation and other non people related sg a it s a simple equation to deliver 70 million of annualized cost synergies in order to realize these cost synergies we expect an additional 15 million to 20 million of integration and restructuring costs to be expensed we anticipate more than 90 of these costs will be expensed in the first half of 2019 with the respective cash payments disbursed by the end of 2019 we ve made significant progress now evaluating the collective owned real estate portfolio which now totals 87 million of net book value 29 million of which is associated with 19 surplus properties which are now either listed for sale or soon will be the remaining 58 million of net book value is associated with owned properties which we are continuing to utilize based upon this progress we remain confident in our ability to realize 30 million of proceeds from selling surplus real estate throughout 2019 and 2020 with potential upside as we evaluate financing alternatives for the 58 million net book value associated with the owned properties we expect to continue to utilize on a go forward basis i would also note that there are other potential cost and fleet synergies which are not yet quantified or otherwise included in the initial 70 million a few examples of these incremental opportunities yet to be evaluated include brand scale efficiency logistics optimization sourcing and procurement and further fleet optimization now as we turn to slide nine in addition to the 70 million of cost synergies there is 140 million of annualized revenue growth opportunity achievable over the next three years attributed to that focusing on the top left side of bar charts i m delighted to confirm that we achieved an average rate of 250 of vaps value per month across all office units delivered in 2018 this rate is up 26 over the ltm levels achieved the prior year and up 7 from the ltm levels the prior sequential quarter i m particularly pleased with this result as the period includes deliveries to many new customers of the acquired customers you may recall we began offering this solution to acting customers in the second quarter and the modspace customers early in the fourth quarter of 2018 our vaps penetration levels are continuing to increase toward our long term stated goals and as noted before we believe this can provide additional upside over this time horizon now the math behind the 140 million of annualized revenue growth is simple it s simply 123 which is the difference between the 250 of the average for the units delivered last year and 127 which is the average value for all units currently on rent times 12 months times approximately 95 5000 units which are on rent which equals 141 million many of these units on rent were delivered by acquired companies which did not offer a ready to work solution timing of the realization of this opportunity is simply paced by the time it takes for the units which are currently on long term leases to return from their current lease and be reequipped and redeployed increasing vaps penetration will remain a key focus of the business aside from m a the expansion of the ready to work value proposition represents the fastest growing aspect of our business with returns of greater than 40 unlevered irrs this value proposition provides a turnkey solution to our customers affording them the ability to focus on immediately getting on with their work we expect demand for this value proposition to continue to increase over the next several years as we both expand our offering and increase penetration to legacy customers as well as new customers of the acquired businesses turning to slide 10 i d like to provide a snapshot of the key us leasing kpis realized in the fourth quarter of 2018 since they are the primary foundation for the run rate with which we entered 2019 i ll first note that this slide is consistent with the preliminary data we shared during the january update call i m also representing the results on a pro forma basis as this best reflects the underlying trajectory of the business first on the top left chart modular space amr of 563 was up 12 6 year over year in the q4 representing the fifth consecutive quarter of solid double digit rate increases the increase is driven both by expanding vaps penetration and willscot price optimization tools in the left middle chart us modular space utilization was up 290 basis points year over year to 75 3 given our continued focus on rate optimization vaps expansion and capital allocation as we rebalanced the acquired idle fleet and in the lower left chart us modular space units on rent were down a modest 1 in the fourth quarter as the company began executing major integration and fleet rebalancing activities across the branch network as previously mentioned we expect unit on rent to remain down on a year over year basis through the first half of 2019 transitioning to a 1 year over year growth by the end of 2019 our primary focus throughout the integration and the subsequent periods of optimization was and remains first the safety of our colleagues second rate harmonization and optimization third vaps penetration and fourth asset utilization as we look forward to 2019 we continue to see sustained double digit year over year revenue growth on average rental rate as we drive pricing and value added products across the combined portfolio before turning it over to tim i d ask you to turn your attention to slide 11 in order to expand a bit upon our diverse end markets and our robust demand outlook first i d like to direct you to the pie chart in the bottom left of the slide which depicts the further disaggregation of our customer profile our customer database is highly fragmented with no individual customer representing more than 3 of our 2018 revenue and the top 50 customers representing less than 15 of the revenues previously we had presented this customer data aggregated into six end market groups we ve now further disaggregated the construction which are the dark green slices and the commercial and industrial groups which are the black slices in order to highlight the significant diversification underlying the portfolio this data includes the willscot legacy customers by sic code as well as those that have joined us through the recent acquisitions a few highlights at the end market level are first while construction and commercial and industrial end markets collectively represent about 80 of our revenues they re actually comprised of 11 discrete end markets providing for an overall very diverse end market mix second no end market represents more than 17 of our revenues non residential general contractors which is its largest group is actually quite diverse in itself as these customers construction projects are typically serving one of our other discrete end markets and finally energy and natural resource end markets represent only 8 of our revenue and has remained stable over the last several quarters the majority of the revenues from the customers in this end market segment are associated with mid and downstream energy mining and other major utilities which will continue to remain stable as they have for several years less than half of these revenues are associated with upstream oil and gas these upstream markets bottomed several quarters ago following the late 2014 decline in oil prices our 2019 outlook simply assumes these upstream markets remained stable although in the medium to longer term an increase in oil prices would potentially be a catalyst for increased demand overall our demand outlook remains quite positive as we continue to see strength across the diverse end markets i d also like to highlight a few relevant external forecasts and indicators first the american rental association is forecasting a 5 annual revenue growth through 2020 second the aia consensus forecast is generally aligned with 3 to 5 growth over the same period the abi which is architecture billing index which has been a great leading indicator for non risk construction activity looking forward nine months to 18 months was a strong 55 3 in january and has been positive for over 24 months non res construction starts on a square foot basis continues to remain supportive with current levels just near long term average and finally us and canada 2019 gdp forecasts offer growth above 2 while largely not included in our outlook we would expect any substantial us infrastructure spending bills once approved and implemented to further underpin and strengthen many of our diverse end markets based upon this demand outlook we expect our net capex growth related investments to be in the range of 30 million to 60 million in 2019 these investments are highly discretionary and assume continued end market strength and vaps growth as we re currently expecting we will be diligent in maintaining our flexible capital strategy investing to support growth as markets allow and balancing growth with long term returns as a reminder one of the key strengths of our business model is the discretion at which we have over capital spending in the short term coupled with over 30 month average lease duration and long lived assets which together allows us to reduce capital spending and drive free cash flow to the extent markets don t support growth we have a disciplined quarterly process through which we control reassess and allocate our capital with that i ll hand it over to tim who will provide additional context timothy boswell chief financial officer thank you brad please turn to slide 13 q4 was an historic period for our company marking the first full quarter of financial results delivered by the combined willscot and modspace organizations while we did not realize any material cost synergies related to modspace in q4 you can begin to see the organic growth and operating leverage in the combined business which we expect will continue to build each quarter in 2019 in the top charts we show our year over year revenue and ebitda growth as they are reported in our financial statements revenues were up 113 6 and adjusted ebitda was up 103 6 versus prior year obviously in q4 2017 we did not own tyson or modspace and we only owned acton for the last 11 days of the quarter so the bulk of the growth is coming from the full contribution of those acquisitions in q4 2018 and the net result was 73 5 million of adjusted ebitda which as brad said is slightly above the midpoint of the q4 range implied by the annual guidance that we increased in october incorporating modspace while straightforward the top charts reinforce two important points first we ve more than doubled the size of the business in the last 12 months and are entering 2019 on a substantially higher earnings trajectory after seamlessly executing three acquisitions secondly the operating leverage is not immediately obvious because prior to any cost synergy realization both acton and modspace initially were dilutive to margins with contributions to adjusted ebitda of less than 25 margins actually declined 140 basis points on an as reported basis from 30 in q4 2017 to 28 6 in q4 2018 due to this dilution from modspace relative to where our legacy willscot business was operating i ll talk about this a bit more when we go into the us segment results the bottom charts look at revenue and adjusted ebitda on a pro forma basis and they paint a clearer picture of what s going on first overall pro forma revenue growth of 3 appears modest but masks a significant and intentional shift in revenue mix away from equipment sales to reoccurring leasing revenues in our us segment modular leasing revenues are up 18 year over year on a pro forma basis more than offsetting an 18 decline in equipment sales and sales represented only 11 of total revenue in q4 with the remainder coming from our leasing operations this resulted in a 7 million net increase in revenue a 5 3 million increase in adjusted ebitda and 140 basis points of adjusted ebitda margin expansion on a proforma basis again that s with no material cost savings yet coming out of modspace this pro forma view is quite helpful because it demonstrates both the net impact of the revenue mix shift as well as the operating leverage that we expect will become more pronounced as we operate the fully integrated business continuing that point on slide 14 we expect that this mix shift toward higher quality leasing revenue to continue and our organic adjusted ebitda growth to accelerate in 2019 at the midpoint of our guidance ranges we expect total revenues will be up 3 3 with leasing revenues offsetting a 30 million to 50 million decline in sale revenue and adjusted ebitda will increase 24 6 on a pro forma basis at the midpoint you ll recall that modspace executed a hurricane relief project in q3 2018 which generated 30 million of revenue so that accounts for the majority of the expected decline in pro forma sale revenues in 2019 and if i adjust for that the pro forma revenue growth exceeds exceed 6 and adjusted ebitda would be up over 28 organically again at the midpoints i ll again highlight the substantial margin expansion we expect to deliver in 2019 and carry into 2020 while acton and modspace were dilutive to ebitda margins initially relative to our legacy willscot business those deals give us the scale that allows us to expand margins rapidly beyond what any of the companies could have achieved independently we expect adjusted ebitda margins to expand over 500 basis points in 2019 on a proforma basis at the midpoint of our ranges and our target margin of approximately 35 in q4 2019 would be up approximately 640 basis points versus our q4 2018 results relative to the q4 starting point of 28 6 again that s our adjusted ebitda margin in the quarter i d expect some modest expansion quarter to quarter in q1 as cost synergies offset what is typically a softer seasonal quarter from a margin standpoint and then over 100 basis points of expansion each quarter thereafter with the larger quarter to quarter and year over year increases coming in q3 and q4 as we said on our january call as we execute this plan our financial profile shifts significantly with consistent net income generation accelerating free cash flow generation and adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million and margins of 35 heading into 2020 sitting here in march with another eventful quarter behind us our original plan since the announcement of the modspace transaction nine months ago are on track on slide 15 we have our usual reconciliation of net loss to adjusted ebitda while we believe adjusted ebitda is the best indicator of our operating performance we remain bottom line focused and expect to improve that bottom line steadily throughout 2019 while net loss did improve by over 96 million in 2018 versus prior year it was obviously a transitional year to say the least with over 86 million of transaction integration and restructuring costs incurred related to our acquisition and refinancing activity that said as brad mentioned those costs are largely behind us with only 15 million to 20 million of integration and restructuring charges remaining related to modspace and if we look at the right hand column of the reconciliation it s easy to bridge how the business will transition to consistent net profitability after isolating the 30 million of transaction related items in q4 and prior to the realization of any modspace cost synergies or future growth on slide 16 brad already highlighted the fundamental leasing kpis in the us segment in the top left chart our us office fleet on rent increased 129 versus prior year to over 86 000 units primarily due to acquisitions the right hand chart show our results on a pro forma basis as if we had owned acton tyson and modspace in 2017 in the top right utilization is up 290 basis points year over year while average units on rent were basically flat organically through the course of 2018 and down 1 year over year in q4 as we entered january in the bottom right as we ve highlighted for some time average rental rates inclusive of value added products were up 12 6 in q4 representing our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit year over year increases in the us segment as significant as those increases have been we believe that we have multiple levers at our disposal that will allow us to continue this rate growth trend through 2019 while we rationalize our fleet and branch network slide 17 goes into a bit more detail on the us segment revenue and adjusted ebitda performance which is frankly driving the trends that i already discussed at the consolidated level in the top left chart you see q4 revenue growth was up 4 4 versus prior year on a pro forma basis so growing faster organically than the overall consolidated results and in the bottom left chart you see adjusted ebitda on an as reported basis ramping due to our acquisitions organic growth and synergy realization related to acton i ll note you see two consecutive quarters of margin contraction from q2 to q3 to q4 that is entirely expected and due to the inclusion of modspace whose revenues contributed approximately 24 to our adjusted ebitda as i said earlier we expect that trend will reverse in 2019 and head to 35 by q4 2019 as we execute our plans those that were with us last year will recall the exact same phenomenon in q1 of 2018 which you can see in the bottom left chart when margins dipped in the first full quarter after the acton acquisition and then rebounded in q2 before the inclusion of modspace revenue in q3 and q4 so all you re seeing in q4 is the revenue weighted average margin of two recently combined businesses prior to synergy realization now with the integration complete we expect those margins will climb to 35 by q4 2019 moving to slide 18 we ll look at our other north america segment which includes operations in canada alaska and mexico we are again showing pro forma metrics for this segment denoted by the white boxes since modspace roughly doubled our presence in canada as we talked about last quarter the other north america segment bottomed in 2018 on a pro forma basis due to the long runoff of upstream oil and gas projects primarily in alberta and alaska resulting from our three year average lease durations and some specific modspace projects that completed in the first half of 2018 average rental rates in the top right chart have essentially been range bound on a pro forma basis for three years and average units on rent in the bottom right chart have been flat for four consecutive quarters with utilization up 80 basis points year over year so we believe these markets have found their supply demand equilibrium and we are seeing modest improvements in canada alaska and mexico as we head into 2019 slide 19 reiterates our expectations for free cash flow in 2019 and is useful to illustrate how those sources and uses of cash change as we head into 2020 with an adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million in 2019 with our current debt structure and maintenance capex requirements we see 130 million to 150 million of free cash flow prior to growth investments that s in the green bar in the middle of the page and that number pushes toward 200 million based on the expected 2020 run rate based on current market conditions new order activity and tremendous traction on value added products we expect to invest at least 30 million of the discretionary growth capex on value added products and we ll evaluate the remaining growth investments as we get deeper into q2 as we shared in january we expect the integration and restructuring costs to be front loaded in 2019 such that we are cash generative in the second half of the year with an accelerating run rate heading into 2020 this is all consistent with what we discussed in january although we have the benefit of our final q4 results and two additional months of performance here in 2019 moving to slide 20 these are the december 31st debt balances that we provided to you in january we remain very comfortable with the flexibility we have to manage the debt structure particularly in light of the cash flow dynamics i just discussed approximately 70 of the debt structure is fixed rate after taking into account the interest rate swap we put in place in november so we see limited interest rate exposure with some clear opportunities to reduce our weighted average cost of debt which is currently approximately 6 6 we have no debt maturities prior to 2022 yet we do have flexibility to repay debt at every level in the debt structure so we have good optionality around how we delever the business in time we drew approximately 23 million on the abl in the quarter to fund 42 million of net capex as well as cash restructuring interest costs and we had 533 million of liquidity in the abl revolver as of december 31st and we ll report 4 6 times leverage to our bank group in q4 based on the definitions in our credit agreement our target leverage range remains 3 times to 4 times as we said in january we expect to achieve the high end of that range organically by q2 2020 assuming current market conditions and a full capital expenditure plan and this is perfectly comfortable given the visibility we have into the earnings growth in the business and the speed with which we can adjust capital spending if we so choose to accelerate the deleveraging the combination of 30 month average lease durations underpinning our lease revenue and a 90 day capital planning cycle create this flexibility in managing our discretionary free cash flow we have some new material for you on slide 21 our business model has always been very efficient from a cash tax standpoint and you will see approximately 2 6 million of cash taxes paid in 2018 in our 10 k aside from that we reported 38 6 million gaap tax benefit which is non cash and approximately 20 7 million of that was due to our final adjustments related to the 2017 tax act there is a detailed reconciliation of our effective tax rate in the 10 k however barring any changes in tax policy or major transaction activity we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 24 to 27 range for gaap purposes in june 2018 when we announced the modspace transaction we noted approximately 50 million of net present value from expected tax benefits i m pleased to report that we ve completed our initial section 382 analysis and we have 936 million of gross us federal nols as of december 31 2018 in addition we have gross deferred tax assets of 557 million related to the section 163 j interest deductions and 50 million from prior capital losses with which we can shield future taxable income and gains in the us these assets offer valuable optionality and we expect will shield any meaningful us federal income taxes for approximately five years to seven years the cash taxes that you see in our cash flow statement are largely state and local in nature and we ve been in a net refund position in canada in recent years my last comment on this page before turning it back to brad the pace and complexity of transaction activity over that past 18 months has been quite high and you ll recall we had identified a material internal control weakness in 2017 specifically related to accounting for income taxes in the context of reverse acquisitions those transactions don t happen every day and while we did take on some additional complex transactions in 2018 i m pleased to affirm that we had no such weaknesses or deficiencies in 2018 this is a testament to some relentless efforts behind the scenes by our team a belt and suspenders remediation plan that we executed throughout the year as well as our preparation for large accelerated filer status in 2019 these are critical milestones as we build the best in class specialty rental services platform in north america with that i ll hand it back to brad on slide 23 for his closing comments and q a bradley soultz chief executive officer thanks tim in closing we delivered on our commitments last year and we expect to do the same into the future we have a simple three ingredient recipe to deliver the 345 million to 365 million adjusted ebitda organically in 2019 while deleveraging this business ingredient one is already in place given we ve completed the modspace integration ingredient two is to deliver the 70 million associated cost synergies and ingredient three is to harmonize and further optimize rate utilization in vaps we re extremely proud of all that we accomplished in 2018 which provides the foundation for a great future we are very confident in our 2019 outlook and in achieving the resulting adjusted ebitda run rate of approximately 400 million with ebitda margins expanding to 35 all while being generating substantial discretionary free cash flow as we exit 2019 these accelerating earnings and the inherent cash flow characteristics of our platform provide confidence that by the second quarter of 2020 we expect to be at or below the 4x net debt to ebitda level in line with our target levels we appreciate now that you ve taken the time to join us today and for your interest in our company we look forward to speaking with many of you very soon that concludes our prepared remarks and we now would be happy to take your questions operator please open the line questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from manav patnaik of barclays your line is open manav patnaik barclays analyst hi good morning guys i guess we ve been through a lot of the financial stuff and so the main question i had for you guys was just around the macro update so you had one deck where you had those i guess the aia consensus forecast and i guess it shows it s almost halving in 2020 and so i guess i was just wondering how do you plan today if you do follow this forecast how do you plan today for the slowdowns and all the different moving pieces if you could just maybe help us understand that better would be helpful timothy boswell chief financial officer you can start with maybe the current macro outlook bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer and i can talk about our response plan bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah so first of all the macro level this is brad our outlook remains quite robust i mean if we look at our quoting activity which we monitor on a weekly basis which is a great indication of inquiries combined with these external forecast all are supportive of continued growth i think just as a reminder i referenced our quarterly capital allocation process whereby we look at this demand on a frequent basis and adjust capital accordingly and i ll ask tim to expand a bit up on that timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah manav i think when i think about this i use kind of slide 19 the free cash flow bridge as a bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer framework with which to think about this and sitting here today as we think about the outlook for 2019 it s hard to see a macro event kind of disrupting the run rate and the trajectory that the business is on so we re kind of looking a bit further into the future as brad said the abi being a great indicator of nine months to 12 months out of future non res construction starts on a square footage which in turn correspond to our delivery volumes we don t see an immediate red flag from a volume perspective barring the disruption that we ve incurred related to the integrations so looking into 2020 what s the plan as we monitor all of our leading indicators quoting activity on the ground being the primary indicator brad mentioned you ll recall we re on a quarterly capital planning cycle and you can see where the capital investments in the business are going in 2019 and that s probably not a bad guidepost to use for 2016 and going forward so i think in any macro environment manav we continue to invest in the value added products and services program we believe that opportunity is really just based on the penetration of our assets not on macro factors so i d expect we continue to fund that growth irrespective of market environment and that will frankly insulate a part of the business along with our three year lease durations from any change in macro conditions that gives you a lot of time then to respond with other fleet investments so you can quite easily pull back on the additional 30 million of growth investments in the fleet and a substantial portion of what we call the maintenance capex manav patnaik barclays analyst yeah bradley soultz chief executive officer can be reduced as well in a declining volume environment we define maintenance capex as the investment level required in a volume neutral market environment so if markets support growth like we think they will in 2019 we d invest above that level and if markets are contracting we can cut that capex and dramatically increase the free cash flow coming out of the business this is a unique dynamic that s fairly unique to our business model and gets us very comfortable with both the capital structure and the outlook manav patnaik barclays analyst got it and just a quick follow up and then i ll hop off it s internally do you see any leading indicators or is it just more of the macro stuff that we all end up seeing that causes you to start acting differently bradley soultz chief executive officer no i think it s there obviously there has been some disruptions in the capital and equity markets and kind of so global concerns but as far as demand at the end market level it remains robust i mean as tim mentioned it s our job to watch it like a hawk and we do if we see things softening if we were to see that we swiftly pull back capital and shift the platform such that we re increasing the free cash flow but circling back to your point i m not seeing anything now that cause me concern in the end markets we have worked through substantial fleet rebalancing and branch consolidation and as i noted before our priority is keep folks safe and drive rates right and increase utilization and as volume opportunities are presented we re very selective about the ones we take manav patnaik barclays analyst okay thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from kevin mcveigh of credit suisse your line is open kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst great thanks hey just help us understand what gave you the confidence to boost the vaps i think it was around 125 million you re going up to 140 million and is there any way to think about what the acceptance rate embedded in that 140 million is bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah the difference if you ll remember kevin last time we published that was a quarter ago kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst yeah bradley soultz chief executive officer that ltm rate was i want to say 234 million from memory right so it s simply continued increased penetration that we realized through the fourth quarter when we put our preliminary results out right we were still consolidating two modspace and willscot systems so we were maybe a little more cautious there but if you can tell i m quite bullish on this i m extremely proud of the fact that we expanded that ltm delivered rate through three acquisitions so i think that s great testament not only to platform but the team that s driving it kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst great and then tim just if you wanted to kind of buy that four turns leverage kind of q2 2020 what could you get it to if you kind of drive it to in a tougher scenario if you wanted to buy by the end of 2020 likely not even macro just you would have kind of focused more on deleveraging as opposed to anything else where do you think you get that leverage to timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah there are too many potential scenarios to give you a specific target kevin so suffice to say could be lower and i would use the capital spending in the business as the primary lever that we would pull between now and q2 of 2020 to influence that number level lower like i said in response to the previous question i don t see as much risk around the run rate from an ebitda standpoint just based on the lease durations in the portfolio so capex would be the primary variable and by sensitizing capex you could sensitize leverage in q2 of 2020 kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst got it and then just quickly is there any kind of meaningful difference in the average lease cap lease duration for modspace versus willscot in the core business bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah it did pull us down slightly i d say some of this is how we measure our data so i don t think there is a fundamental difference in the two portfolios we reported a 30 month average lease duration most recently in a year ago we would have been talking about 35 month average lease duration across portfolio we see no real change in terms of if you compare like for like contracts or transactions rather in terms of the ultimate lease durations so we ll keep an eye on it as the portfolios harmonize if you recall the biggest difference between the modspace fleet and the willscot fleet is that modspace had a slightly higher mix of complexes these are the buildings that we coupled together to make larger square footage installations and those are actually tend to have longer lease durations than the smaller single wide units for example that we acquired from acton kevin damien mcveigh credit suisse ag analyst got it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from sean wondrack of deutsche bank your line is open sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst hey guys and congratulations on completing the integration bradley soultz chief executive officer thanks sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst so just touching on a couple of things in the end markets it s great to hear the robust outlook there are couple of things that i ve sort of heard i had a company reduced guidance this morning based on weather that sort of impacted construction also we had the government shutdown can you comment on both of them and has that really impacted your business or is there anything else sort of holding you back and that you can think about in q1 bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah i would say there has been a bit of weather anomaly this year it s not something that concerns me because five years in the business it s not unusual i would say it s been more broad spread throughout both canada and the us and as mentioned i mean what it typically means is maybe a delay in a month or two of project starting our inquiries or quotes remain very robust frankly above our targets for the combined portfolio so yeah it is factual i think there has been a bit of impact on new activations associated with that but i think we re talking about weeks and months here not something that gives me concern we left the first we left the fourth quarter down a modest 1 if you think about that fourth quarter maybe half to two thirds of it was pretty significantly impacted by these modspace branch consolidation and reallocation if you remember that started in november and then that activity kind of continued heavily into the first quarter so i think as commented before we expect to be down unit on rent through the first half and then slowly bringing that back to up a modest 1 at the end of the year sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst great timothy boswell chief financial officer it s also safe to say we re reiterating our guidance today so whatever softness you see on the volume side we see opportunity on pricing in value added products sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst great fair enough and with government being roughly 3 of your overall demand did you see any impact from the shutdown and then you also mentioned some of these discrete end market opportunities obviously the immigration issue has been a very politically charged issue but if you can kind of comment on what you re seeing through boots on the ground there would be helpful bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah we didn t really see anything on the government side at all good or bad i guess if you will and these kind of discrete end market opportunities first i d characterize this is a very broad portfolio across mexico us and canada so at any one time there is usually one or two of those going on somewhere right and typically as those events occur we ll see a surge in demand and certainly a surge in sustained pricing one of the more recent national issues the wildfires in california i think the infrastructure plans are just finalized that that business has just been awarded for the rebuild and we expect to experience some benefits of that but then just again keep in mind that s one little small piece of a very broad portfolio here so kind of ebbs and flows over time if you will sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst great i ll ask one more and i ll get back in queue just regarding your current capital structure you outlined your goals you ve been basically hitting all of the goals that you ve outlined some of your debt is shorter term do you foresee there being sort of a global refi in the next few years as you move on to the next stage of your growth bradley soultz chief executive officer look we ll undertake all that opportunistically sean it s hard to sit here today and say yes we re absolutely going to refi everything so what i like about the debt structure specifically is in the meantime setting aside any global refinancing you ve got a handful of tactical things you could do flexibility to pay down at every tranche in the debt structure and given our free cash profile is shifting dramatically in the second half of this year and heading into 2020 i think we ll definitely start with those tactical opportunities and be opportunistic as it relates to everything else sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst okay great thank you i ll turn it over operator thank you our next question comes from ashish sabadra with deutsche bank your line is open ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst hey brad thanks for providing all the details a quick question about the vaps monthly rate of 250 million sorry 250 on an ltm basis can you do you provide what the penetration rate for vaps was there and maybe any color on what the average vaps monthly rate is right now ongoing bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah so we do not provide specific penetration guidance i think the 250 is if you think about dollars per unit it s the best reflection of penetration we have characterized that that 200 to 250 level represents about a 40 furniture penetration meaning of 100 units we shipped in the period 40 were fully equipped with furniture and 60 weren t and that increase in penetration over time is what s really driving that increase in value we ve stated that our internal target is to drive that penetration to 80 over the next several years and as noted i m pretty encouraged about the progress through these acquisitions and the early adoption of the new customers timothy boswell chief financial officer ashish this is tim ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst okay that s great yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer in response to the second part of your question which is the overall average if you look at slide nine in the top left chart our delivered rate on contracts in the last 12 months is 250 of recurring monthly revenue per unit per month and the overall portfolio average is the 127 that you see next to it so what s interesting here is the 127 is actually down slightly bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer and that is due to the dilution from acton and modspace because they do not have as robust of a value added products program so you actually have the overall portfolio average that has contracted slightly due to the acquisition dilution we ve continued to push the delivered rates therefore the spread between delivered rates and the overall portfolio widened resulting in the higher revenue potential number that brad articulated ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst that s extremely helpful and my yeah so i guess as you continue to improve penetration what i was wondering was that there could be potential upside to even that 250 number on the monthly run rate as the penetration continues to improve but maybe my next question was around margins tim and you laid out the 35 margins in the fourth quarter of 2019 as we think about going forward there are still opportunities like for further cost synergies as well as the pricing and vaps those are higher margin businesses so the right way to think about it is that further upside to that 35 margins in the out years timothy boswell chief financial officer yes bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer we believe there is opportunity on the cost synergy slide that brad talked about in the bottom left hand corner there is a list of very logical projects that we are undertaking that could certainly contribute to future margin expansion if we rewind a year and a half ago when we were first marketing williams scotsman to the spec we did present an ebitda margin bridge that went up to 38 bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer based on it was illustrative but yes we have from the outset of this journey had line of sight to higher margins ashish sabadra deutsche bank ag analyst that s great congrats once again on solid results operator thank you and our next question comes from phil ng of jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys you ve seen really strong momentum on amr do you expect that double digit run rate to be sustainable in 2019 just based on the updated vaps opportunity alone it kind of implies about mid single digit lift annually so just curious how you re thinking about for like for like pricing and any other mix dynamics we should be appreciative of timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah that s exactly what we expect it s consistent with the january update we gave and you re right value added products will continue to be driving at least half of that year over year improvement bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah timothy boswell chief financial officer as you think about what other levers we have to manage pricing just on the modules themselves we obviously we ve got the upfront rental rates which have been supportive you ll recall that an average contract that we signed last for about 11 months but ends up staying on rent 30 months on average so you ve got flexibility to manage rates during that intervening period and we ve been rolling out the price optimization platform across the combined volume of the willscot acton and modspace portfolio so you ve got really four different levers right now that we re managing in order to drive absolute rate improvement phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s really helpful and just on that note how has the new sales force from modspace transitioned away from maybe how they approached pricing or rate optimization and then the upselling piece for vaps have you kind of provided any new training for the new sales force and has that resonated well i m just curious this new customer base that you have via acquired assets have has vaps resident in a similar fashion for them as well bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah phil this is brad i d say that was a pleasant find once we were under the hood with modspace so first of all well there were redundant or overlapping sales rep between william scotsman and modspace we obviously focused on the best talent and generally it was about a 50 50 selection the modspace team had begun to implement the same rate optimization tools that scotsman was deploying and had begun to offer furniture through a third party lease release so i would say it was already well within their behaviors and their mindset we did have an all sales and operations joint session back in october of last year where we really focused everyone on the william scotsman operating platform and then significant training on our tools and processes and we continue to follow that so long and short of it is they ve been great adopters and adapters they ve already started on that journey i m very pleased with the progress and i m sure that s contributing to the increase in vaps that we spoke about earlier phil ng jefferies analyst got it and just one last one for me tim appreciated you provided some of that color on the free cash flow run rate exiting 2020 of 200 million obviously the which is a nice acceleration the other piece i just want to make sure if you could help us frame up is just the discretionary spend associated with that whether it s capex and what s left on the restructuring front we should be mindful of thanks timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah so on the free cash flow bridge the assumptions i m making that get to a 200 million this is directional discretionary free cash flow number some improvement on our overall cost of debt combined with the 400 million ebitda run rate and then the capex assumption for 2020 sitting here today i d say use the 2019 guidance as directional guidance for the foreseeable future in this market environment so does that answer your question phil phil ng jefferies analyst with the discretionary piece was there anything that we need to be mindful of because you gave maintenance capex and i guess the growth capex piece i guess we could kind of flush out whatever you guided for 2019 is there anything else that we should be thoughtful of in terms of like restructuring spend that in the discretionary ph bradley soultz chief executive officer no as you get into 2020 we expect that all the restructuring costs on a cash basis to be incurred in this view you do if you just think about our cash flow statement you have the gross profit associated with our rental unit sales so just make sure you re capturing that piece if you re starting with ebitda as the starting point for your bridge but other than that no we expect the integration restructuring to have been completed from a cash standpoint barring any other transaction activity phil ng jefferies analyst okay all right so that s a pretty solid number that s really nice acceleration appreciate the color thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from scott schneeberger of oppenheimer your line is open scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks good morning and congratulations guys on executing very well in 2018 first question for me could you please discuss the drivers of the 12 6 rental rate growth in the fourth quarter in terms of core rate repricing acquired assets and perhaps growth and then tim how might you think about the composition going forward thanks timothy boswell chief financial officer yeah scott we talked about this a little bit in january in rough numbers approximately 60 of the percentage growth in q4 was coming from the base rates and the remainder was coming from the value added products opportunity and like i think roughly 50 50 mix as you go through 2019 is a reasonable assumption and we are managing those a bit independently so if one take it the way the other may give it a bit bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst understand thanks and then just could you discuss the expected cadence of adjusted ebitda over the quarters of 2019 and perhaps elaborate on some seasonal dynamics it was touched upon earlier but obviously you have a bit of a sporadic history with acquisitions latent in there so just a little bit of thought of the cadence this year would be great help thanks bradley soultz chief executive officer yeah i mean my comments earlier were around the pace of the margin expansion obviously we haven t been giving quarterly guidance but appreciate that there has been a fair amount of change in the portfolio so it s a good question as you go from q4 and what we re at 28 6 adjusted ebitda margin in q4 i d expect some modest expansion going into q1 which in prior years would be a little unusual usually q1 is a bit lower from a margin perspective so what we have going on is that usual seasonal weakness from a margin standpoint as your variable costs start to ramp up heading into q2 but it s offset by cost synergy realization that will be generated from really all of the acton synergies as well as the beginning of the modspace synergies then that margin percentage expansion should expand by as i said about 100 basis points quarter to quarter with the larger improvements happening in q3 and q4 so those margin percentages and we saw this in q4 scott for example can be impacted pretty significantly by sale volume so that s probably the primary variable that can change things quarter to quarter but when you look at the kind of the core underlying leasing gross margin which is where we have the bulk of our management time and attention is focused that doesn t surprise us as much scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst all right thanks yeah i appreciate that tim very helpful thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from sean wondrack of deutsche bank your line is open sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst hey guys just one more quick one from me could you comment on the m a environment if you re seeing any other opportunities there and kind of what you re seeing there please bradley soultz chief executive officer i mean we obviously can t comment about specifics but i think i characterized on the last call with the modspace integration behind us we have the capability and the capacity to make further acquisitions we ve also consistently said we re not going to over pay and we re not going to over lever so coming back to our primary focus right now that the modspace system integrations are complete is harvest the 70 million in cost synergies drive this vaps growth potential and delever the platform back into the 4x range so we ve got the capability and capacity to do it we re not compelled to do it and we re not going to over pay and we re not going to increase leverage sean wondrack deutsche bank analyst okay thank you very much operator thank you i d like to turn the call back over to mr brad soultz for closing comments bradley soultz chief executive officer hi thanks everyone for joining the call i think as we said before we re really proud of 2018 accomplishments beyond the financials as well and extremely excited about the future for this pretty unique and fast growing specialty rental platform so thanks everyone have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today s conference you may

will the sixth year be a charm for haruhiko kuroda few questions carry greater weight in asia as the bank of japan governor tries to avoid another recession that asia s no 2 economy might be in one already might seem fanciful six years ago prime minister shinzo abe set out to defeat deflation and banish the business cycle his secret weapon hiring kuroda to launch history s most audacious monetary experiment kuroda seemed an inspired choice he d just spent eight years heading the asian development bank in manila kuroda s remit there promoting inclusive growth seemed an asset who better to help the boj gain traction and his past as a top ministry of finance official accorded kuroda a high degree of gravitas in markets yet six years on kuroda looks terribly short on wins inflation is barely halfway to the 2 target wages are still walking in place despite the longest expansion since the 1980s and the boj now owns more than half of the government bond market and 80 of exchange traded funds its balance sheet is now bigger than the entire 4 9 trillion economy moreover japan s economy is slowing abruptly as trade war headwinds intensify exports plunged 5 2 in real terms from december machinery orders fell 5 4 the latest quarterly survey of sentiment among japan s biggest manufacturers showed a reading of 7 3 the lowest since the second quarter of 2016 all this spells recession kurodanomics the problem of course is that abenomics is really kurodanomics in six years abe pulled off none of the shock therapy reforms he advertised in 2012 some tweaks here and there but nothing to recalibrate growth engines from exports to innovation and services abe relied too much on kuroda s quantitative easing and a weaker yen and detrimentally so how can the boj turn things around by getting transactional with team abe the betting is on kuroda s team pushing its monetary tentacles further into government debt and etfs it won t help though japan s problem isn t the supply of yen but uses for all that liquidity bankers are more apt to sit on cash than lend it the missing link is a big bang that unleashes a startup boom incentivizes companies to invent new growth industries and shakes up an atrophied corporate system it is time kuroda took his gravitas out for a ride and prodded the government to do its part why not seek a grand bargain of sorts monetary stimulus in exchange for supply side upgrades one of the best examples of this quid pro quo dynamic was in washington in the early 1990s then federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was under pressure to loosen policy he was reluctant to do so lower rates might have incentivized bill clinton s white house to run up budget deficits even further so greenspan cooked up an arrangement with then us treasury secretary robert rubin if clinton s team made notable progress moving the budget to a surplus the greenspan fed would lean dovish the compromise worked propelling growth and stocks higher and us treasury debt yields lower prototype granted washington has fouled things up royally since then one wall street crisis and one donald trump presidency later and the deficit is on the cusp of 1 trillion still the greenspan rubin deal could be a prototype for one kuroda could strike with finance minister taro aso and economy minister hiroshige seko kuroda should say if you gentlemen want more monetary support you must do your part and convincingly so since 2012 team abe pledged to modernize labor markets shift tax incentives toward smaller companies empower women slash red tape and encourage risk taking kuroda can play the role of honest broker and prod tokyo to regain reformist momentum this includes employing the bully pulpit to cajole the government into action abe s failure to act after six years is hitting his approval ratings now 43 3 in the latest kyodo news poll abe has a clear reform blueprint for which there s broad popular support with a mild amount of public support kuroda could shame abe into acting kuroda s gravitas could prod japan inc to give workers a raise at their post abenomics peak companies were sitting on 2 trillion of cash that could be spent raising wages and investment but so far abe hasn t found a way to get executives to open their wallets kicking off a virtuous consumption cycle perhaps kuroda can help if the boj and mof work together what better way to make this sixth year a charm for kurodanomics
politicians led by senate crossbench populists leapt at the opportunities offered by the us president s new you beaut modern money doctrine why wouldn t they it meant the cash rate could be permanently set at zero and removed all spending limits the real magic there was no need for canberra to lift taxes because the long era of low inflation and depressed sovereign yields convinced people there was no danger ballooning government debt would lead to bankruptcy happy days indeed bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez leading democrats flirting with an unorthodox remedy to economic stagnation bloomberg ap except of course that in this imaginary world the introduction of a hugely expensive state guaranteed and funded work for all plan has sent unemployment to 0 5 per cent the ultra easy monetary policy has pushed household debt to 300 per cent of gdp and there is double digit inflation to fix these problems treasury s modern monetary theory department which has replaced the old macroeconomic group tells cabinet it had to hike taxes advertisement and not by a little bit these hikes need to be big enough slow the economy and bring the inflation anchor back to the target band a depressed treasurer knows the prime minister will never approve such political suicide welcome to the world of modern monetary theory or mmt for short hypothetical for now but perhaps not forever an old idea newly reprised mmt is currently fuelling a frenzied debate du jour among economists investors and politicians in the us but also increasingly in europe and australia much of the battle is being waged in places like cnbc and social media and the heaviest action is between democrat old guard critics like paul krugman versus an energised far left flank are we that desperate glenn stevens former reserve bank governor advertisement the row has erupted with astonishing speed in recent months one of the main catalysts appears to be the fact that a long standing mmt advocate stephanie kelton of stony brook university is an economic adviser to senator bernie sanders who three weeks ago launched his campaign for the democratic nomination at first glance the whole thing sparks incredulity are we that desperate as former reserve bank governor glenn stevens put it three years ago in a speech in new york when he warned about the taboo breaking dangers of helicopter money which was briefly all the rage in 2016 amid another debate on a theory not dissimilar to mmt that speech is worth re reading today but many are taking such ideas seriously this time around because high profile and populist figures on the left such as new york congresswoman ocasio cortez are eager proponents respected bond investor mohamed el erian said this week mmt is fuelling an interesting conversation partly because the heavy reliance on unconventional central bank policy since the gfc has not led where some economists feared it might a meaningful inflation scare or the crowding out of economic activity advertisement con michalakis chief investment officer at south australia s biggest industry fund statewide who happens to be on a road trip through the us this week says he s been struck by both the intensity of the mmt debate and that so many big name market investors in the us are watching it so closely one such investor from a big us west coast money manager believes it underscores why the biggest risks facing markets these days are political michalakis told afr weekend the extraordinary lack of fiscal discipline displayed by donald trump and his republican party should take a good deal of the blame for the current fascination with mmt the president s 2017 tax cuts have not despite republican assurances become self funding instead according to a congressional budget office report this month cumulative federal budget deficits will amount to us12 4 trillion 17 6 trillion over the next 10 years total debt will leap from us14 7 trillion to us28 7 trillion in 2028 or nearly 100 per cent of gdp putting the us on a path that increases chances of a fiscal crisis advertisement there would be a greater risk that investors would become unwilling to finance the government s borrowing unless they were compensated with very high interest rates if that happened interest rates on federal debt would rise suddenly and sharply the budget office said so far however bond investors aren t buying that story inadvertently emboldening the mmt crowd who say it proves as some republicans have famously maintained for decades that deficits don t matter nothing expresses that insouciance more than the benchmark us treasury bond yield which traded at 2 63 per cent on friday down from 3 24 per cent in october you can see the logic from here if republicans can get away with it why should democrats run hairshirt fiscal policy when they next win office mmt seeks to provide a rebranded intellectual framework to put that sentiment into practice on a monumental scale advertisement one of the world s more prominent backers australian economist bill mitchell at the university of newcastle claims that unlike conventional monetary and fiscal policy the mmt approach is grounded in what the government can actually do bill mitchell professor of economics at the university of newcastle is enthusiastic about mmt simone de peak most of the so called financial constraints on government expressed in statements like well how are you going to pay for it are in fact political constraints says mitchell in a video posted on this blog to promote the release last month of a modern monetary theory textbook that sanders adviser kelton has promoted on social media a currency issuing government can purchase whatever is for sale in that currency including all idle labour he adds complete nonsense jeffrey gundlach doubleline capital except for the very real risk that people will also abandon that currency when they realise the whole thing is unsustainable something that has been demonstrated time and time again through history advertisement for now among economists investors and policy makers mmt s supporters as opposed to noisesome twitter activists are heavily outnumbered by critics it s complete nonsense jeffrey gundlach co founder of doubleline capital a los angeles firm overseeing us120 billion said this week this argument is ridiculous it sounds good for a first grader what happens when the economy turns down benoit coeure a french member of the european central bank s executive board says more charitably that mmt has produced a good discussion to have because it challenges the traditional way of looking at fiscal and monetary policy but he adds there are severe limitations to the assumptions ecb chief economist peter praet was less diplomatic this week describing as a dangerous proposition the notion of using central banks to finance government debt a chicago booth igm forum experts panel of some of america s top economists including a several nobel prize winners this week showed none thought mmt is a good idea advertisement the only real debate is between those who disagree with policy prescriptions and those who strongly disagree says justin wolfers at the university of michigan i figure that i m a phd economist with a fair bit of experience and so if i m not following along perhaps it really isn t my fault justin wolfers economist wolfers a high profile australian economist who has dared tangle on social media with mmt s cheerleaders sounds mostly irritated by the debate and the way adherents continually move the goalposts of their arguments you can probably tell that i m not a fan he told afr weekend i ve put in some time trying to figure out what these guys are on about but at a certain point if it isn t clear i stop blaming myself i figure that i m a phd economist with a fair bit of experience and so if i m not following along perhaps it really isn t my fault and many of my friends have said something similar that they find it hard to discern just what the heck the mmt folks are saying advertisement the danger is that mmt lures voters because it contains a few glimmers of truth a bit like trump s america first vows to tear up trade deals and bring back american jobs all good in theory in reality it creates a needless mess odds are my fictional aussie treasurer would throw in the towel over his terrible political economy conundrum tax hikes can wait until after the next election it s just not worth the pain he d conclude as stan veuger a scholar at the american enterprise institute puts it when inflation takes hold let alone hyperinflation so will human nature it is hard to imagine that elected officials would find it easier to maintain price stability through fiscal policy than they did when they directly implemented monetary policy do we really need to learn this again

regina chi is vice president and portfolio manager at agf investments inc there was a time back in the 1990s when emerging markets all seemed to be working from the same playbook but these days many em countries are busy carving out their own path to the future while rewriting an outdated script still the perception that em is one homogeneous asset class persists despite its evolution as a diverse group of countries with different opportunities as well as risks and drivers em economies are evolving and many are stepping up the value chain each with their own economic cycle political realities and market structure and while a number of macroeconomic forces sideswiped em markets in 2018 many of those headwinds are now shifting to tailwinds not only are valuations in em favourable but growth in gross domestic product is poised to outstrip that of developed markets in 2019 the upshot there are lots of reasons for optimism as we look to em this year yet investors would do well to pick their spots balancing the opportunities against the risks while investing in disparate em countries the em that was back in the 1980s and 1990s em countries were largely commodity based economies often with large account deficits meaning they owed debt in u s and european currencies making them particularly vulnerable to external macroeconomic policies early investors who were initially intrigued by rapid rates of industrialization and soaring growth rates later got spooked caught in the cross fire of a string of financial crises beginning with the mexican peso crisis in 1994 brought on by the mexican government s devaluation of the peso followed by the east asian financial crisis in 1997 and the taper tantrum in 2013 when the u s federal reserve began to reduce the amount of money it was injecting into the economy these shocks set off a negative chain reaction in the global economy yet ultimately proved to be the catalyst for sweeping reforms in many em countries india for example began opening up large parts of its economy to foreign investment meanwhile significant fiscal and monetary reforms were implemented in asia culminating in china s entry into the world trade organization in 2001 rise of the new em fast forward to 2019 and the picture takes on a remarkably different and nuanced hue infrastructure driven sectors such as industrials materials and energy are less important drivers of performance while many em economies have shifted into a new generation of growth based on technology and innovation with a focus on higher value goods and services the recent explosion of china s technological firepower for example coupled with its new strategic plan made in china 2025 has given rise to a designed in china model that some call chinnovation meanwhile other countries and regions like those in latin american and south africa are endowed with natural resources and still in the early stage of their development reform is continuing many countries are now issuing bonds in their own currencies for example while slashing debt loads and current account deficits many have also pursued other structural reforms to enhance fiscal discipline and shield their economies from external shocks while bolstering markets for the future yet other countries continue to be plagued by precarious economies and institutions with persistent structural imbalances by the numbers a comparison of sector weightings on the msci emerging markets index representing 24 countries tells the story of ems remarkable transformation between 2008 and 2018 in 2008 for example information technology accounted for 10 per cent of the index versus 27 per cent last year energy represented 19 per cent in 2008 compared with 7 per cent last year and materials have

are likely to gain traction over the coming months the government expects 2019 gdp growth of between 6 per cent and 6 5 per cent compared to last year s rate of 6 6 per cent bloomberg data shows czech

jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call we ended 2018 on a strong sales note with a 4 comp in the fourth quarter while we certainly faced various challenges throughout the year we believe 2018 was a great year for our employees our shareholders and we remained squarely focused on taking care of our customers as we head into 2019 we are excited to have so many new opportunities ahead of us during today s call i will cover five main topics i ll start with key highlights from the fourth quarter results then i ll update you on our progress and outlook for our digital and non consumable initiatives third i ll lay out two new strategic initiatives we are excited to be launching fourth i ll give you an update on the results we are achieving with our operating priorities and finally i ll finish with our operating plans for fiscal 2019 john will provide you with some 2018 financial highlights guidance for fiscal 2019 and our perspective on dollar general s long term growth turning to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial performance we delivered a very strong top line in the fourth quarter with net sales increasing 8 5 to 6 6 billion compared to net sales of 6 1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full fiscal year net sales increased 9 2 to 25 6 billion compared to net sales of 23 5 billion in fiscal 2017 the strong net sales performance throughout fiscal 2018 was balanced between performance from both new stores and mature stores during 2018 we continue to gain market share in highly consumable product sales which was a key driver of our strong sales performance syndicated data shows that we had mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4 week 12 week 24 week and 52 week periods ending january 26 2019 for full year comp sales we posted a 3 2 growth rate for fiscal 2018 marking our 29th consecutive year of same store sales growth given the overall strength of the economy in 2018 this continued growth underscores our belief that our business model can perform well in all economic cycles we are proud to continue our legacy of serving the underserved by providing them with the value and convenience that they have come to expect from dollar general as i mentioned we finished the year with a very strong 4 same store sales growth rate in the fourth quarter this growth resulted in our highest two year stack in 21 quarters and our third consecutive quarter of accelerated two year comp stack growth the fourth quarter top line performance was driven by growth in both average transaction amount and customer traffic this quarter s average transaction amount growth included expansion in average unit retail and increased units per basket driving profitable traffic is paramount to the health of our business over the long term this quarter we took steps to continue providing our customers with terrific value and focused on promotional activities that allowed us to take share from multiple classes of trade we believe we can sustain these share gains in 2019 and that these investments attract the customers who will continue to shop at dollar general these actions were especially important in the fourth quarter given the increased seasonal sales volume seen across retail industry during this time of year we achieved our goals of growing traffic and market share and continue to broaden our overall customer base we were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth in non consumables we are particularly excited about our performance in the home category which led overall comp growth in the fourth quarter the team is doing a great job in this category which led to our best performance in home in many years this is the first time in quite a while that we ve seen a non consumable category out top consumable growth during the fourth quarter we believe same store sales benefited from the acceleration of february snap payments during the government shutdown based upon our analysis of ebt sales we estimated this created an approximate 70 basis point benefit for same store sales as we head into 2019 we believe we have compelling opportunities to gain more market share drive profitable traffic to our conveniently located stores and deliver more of the products our customer seeks at the value she needs we remain focused on these opportunities and after john s discussion i look forward to sharing how we are targeting our efforts in 2019 with that i will now turn the call over to john john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you todd and good morning everyone i would like to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year and then i ll take a few minutes to discuss our fiscal 2019 financial guidance i ll also provide you with some thoughts on our long term business perspective unless i specifically note otherwise all comparisons are year over year as todd already discussed sales i will start with gross profit which as a percentage of sales was 31 2 in the fourth quarter a decrease of 91 basis points this decrease was partially attributable to higher markdowns as todd mentioned this quarter we proactively invested in promotional activity to drive traffic and market share and we believe we remain well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographies where we operate that said pricing is always competitive in discount retail and we watch the environment very closely in 2019 our strategy is to further optimize our promotional activities as we focus on driving profitable sales and traffic growth gross margin in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower initial markups on inventory purchases an increase in the lifo provision a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and the sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category partially offsetting these items was lower inventory shrink sg a as a percentage of sales was 21 6 a decrease of 34 basis points the decrease was driven by reductions in repairs and maintenance expenses benefits costs and incentive compensation expenses and lower utilities as a percentage of net sales partially offsetting those decreases were approximately 11 7 million in hurricane related expenses due two hurricanes which occurred during the third quarter of 2018 as well as a 2 2 million year over year increase in other disaster related expenses both of which were greater than anticipated in our original fiscal year 2018 forecast as a reminder 2017 fourth quarter sg a expense included costs related to accelerated store closures moving down the income statement our effective tax rate for the quarter was an expense of 21 2 this compares to a negative 18 9 tax rate in the fourth quarter last year which was a benefit the benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at the new lower federal corporate tax rate as a result of federal tax reform diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 1 84 which includes an approximate 0 04 negative impact of disasters the majority of which was driven by hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong at the end of fiscal 2018 merchandise inventories were 4 1 billion at the end of fiscal 2018 up 13 5 overall and an increase of 7 3 on a per store basis over the end of the 2017 fiscal year inventory levels increased in the back half of fiscal 2018 as we brought in inventory to stock our new longview texas distribution center additionally as we discussed with you last quarter we proactively made some strategic and opportunistic forward inventory buys in part due to concerns over potential tariff increases these buys aimed at keeping overall costs low contributed to the higher inventory level at year end as we noted in recent quarters we have been successfully reducing shrink while also increasing on shelf availability this dynamic is difficult to both achieve and maintain in 2019 we are taking action to update our inventory replenishment cycle to support even higher levels of on shelf availability for our customers every day while continuing to take actions designed to further reduce shrink we believe our inventory quality is in great shape and our goal remains to drive inventory growth that is in line with or below our sales growth over time fiscal 2018 was another year of strong cash flow from operations which totaled 2 1 billion an increase of 341 million or 18 9 total capital expenditures for 2018 were 734 million and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations continued investments in construction for two new distribution centers and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives during the quarter we repurchased 3 4 million shares of our common stock for 360 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0 29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of 75 million for the full year we returned a total of 1 3 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends the remaining repurchase authorization at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 346 million and yesterday our board approved an additional 1 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we are focused on financial returns our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth we also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends all while maintaining our current investment grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to ebitdar turning now to fiscal 2019 this year we expect our core business to continue to deliver strong growth and allow us to invest in our ongoing strategic initiatives as well as the two new ones that todd will discuss in greater detail shortly overall our long term financial performance goals remain squarely focused on delivering strong growth in net sales comp store sales operating profit and diluted eps which is also supported by our financial strategies in some years we will balance the decision to invest with delivering on our long term goal of double digit adjusted eps growth we believe that net sales comp store sales operating profit and diluted eps are the core metrics that you should be focusing on in order to gauge our progress i will now provide you with our outlook on these metrics for 2019 for fiscal 2019 we expect net sales growth of approximately 7 and comp sales growth of approximately 2 5 moving on to profitability i d like to share a few insights with you we are of course laser focused on operating profit and operating profit margin in 2019 we expect to grow operating profit by approximately 4 to 6 our goal is to improve operating profit margin over time and we believe we are making the right operating decisions and investments to achieve this goal this year this means that we ll be making investments in strategic initiatives including dg fresh a supply chain initiative as well as fast track and in stock productivity and customer service initiative while both of these initiatives are still in the early test phase we believe these investments will allow us to enhance our operating margin profile over the long term the associate investments however will pressure sg a rates in the near term with this as a backdrop i ll now provide you with a few other insights into overall gross margin and sg a spend for 2019 first the changes to our inventory replenishment cycle that i mentioned earlier will have an initial gross margin price tag mostly due to the impact on product inventory mix in addition there will be a working capital outlays required there is correlation between on shelf availability and sales and we believe these changes will position us to support and drive top line growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond second on transportation while we have seen some signs of stabilization in a more balanced marketplace we anticipate that we could see continued transportation cost increases in 2019 third on tariffs our guidance assumes that the government maintains current tariff levels and the guidance does not contemplate any increases in rates or any additional tariff enactment we believe that the first quarter gross margin will be the most pressured on a year over year basis and that we will see improvements in the year over year comparison as the year progresses regarding sg a we will have start up expenses related to the two new initiatives in addition to ongoing investments in other strategic initiatives in total we expect to spend approximately 50 million on these strategic initiatives in 2019 the majority of which will be in our two new initiatives we expect these investments to pressure sg a particularly in the first half of the fiscal year while these sg a investments should improve gross margin and overall operating margin over time they will move our sg a leverage range above 2 5 to 3 that said we believe these investments will be accretive as early as 2020 given these gross margin and sg a expense factors we expect operating margins to be more pressured during the first half of the year based on these dynamics we are providing fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share guidance of 6 30 to 6 50 our diluted eps guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 22 to 22 5 in 2019 overall our capital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately 775 million to 825 million as we continued to invest in strategic initiatives and general business need to drive and support future growth in terms of cash distributions to shareholders yesterday our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 32 per share which is an increase of approximately 10 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 dividend in fiscal 2019 we plan to repurchase approximately 1 billion of our common stock we are pleased with our strong position as we enter the year and we are very excited for our plans for 2019 as always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for long term growth we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same store sales growth healthy new store returns strong free cash flow and long term shareholder value with that i will turn the call back over to todd todd vasos chief executive officer thank you john i m proud of the team s execution that led to the strong results this year and feel confident that we re making the right investments and operating decisions that will allow us to extend our runway for profitable growth now i d like to spend a few minutes providing you with an update on the progress we have made on our digital and non consumable initiatives and outline two new transformational strategic initiatives that we re launching starting first with digital in 2019 our digital strategy will remain focused on using technology to further enhance the in store experience we are confident that we can use technology to create a more personalized and convenient shopping experience for our customers in 2018 we launched the dg go app which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop see a running total of the items in their basket using our card calculator and then skip the checkout line by using the dg go kiosk the app has been popular with our customers and through the end of fiscal 2018 we had more than 140 000 downloads and exited the year with approximately 25 000 monthly active users despite only having dg go kiosk in approximately 250 stores pending performance data our goal in 2019 will be to expand this offering to more stores we have engaged with our customers to understand how they are using the app to learn how we might improve it further one key learning is that our customers are using the card calculator frequently even when they re not using dg go kiosk to checkout we believe they re using the card calculator stay within their budgets and optimize their shopping dollars based on this we recently launched card calculator in approximately 200 stores throughout the first half of 2019 we intend to roll out this useful tool for our customers in the majority of our stores we have invested and upgraded wifi to facilitate in store use of this and other digital tools having a user friendly and helpful suite of digital tools is becoming increasingly important to our customers and therefore to dollar general we know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tend to shop with us more often and check out with larger average baskets in fact their baskets on average are about twice as large as those of non digitally engaged shoppers currently we have more than 15 million digital coupon subscriber accounts and more than 900 million digital coupons were clipped in 2018 our goals in 2019 are to increase our subscriber base and perhaps more importantly the frequency of use we want to make sure that users are engaged with our app more frequently to save time and money this means that we will be launching digital marketing strategies focused on customer acquisition retention and engagement our goal is to use personalization to drive both sales and gross margin benefit over time finally as we continue to test and learn within our digital strategy we plan to pilot buy online pickup in store offering in the second half of fiscal 2019 we are in the early stages of many of these efforts within our digital strategy and we are excited about the potential and the opportunities that lie ahead turning now to non consumable initiative or nci in 2018 we began our test of a bold new and expanded assortment in key non consumable categories of home domestics housewares party and occasion with the amount of space dedicated to non consumables that remains the same we believe this merchandise strategy will drive greater sell through the nci offering was added to approximately 700 stores as of the end of 2018 and we plan to have it in approximately 2 400 stores by the end of 2019 it is important to note that while it is still relatively early we have now worked through multiple replenishment cycles and we like the momentum the reset is generating we are seeing improvements in traffic and sales as well as meaningful improvement in category mix and gross margin within these stores we believe this offering will continue to generate excitement for our customers as it rolls out more broadly today i m excited to introduce two new transformational initiatives that we are rolling out in 2019 the first initiative is one that we call dg fresh the dg fresh initiative is a strategic multi phase shift to self distribution of perishable goods primarily fresh and frozen we believe this initiative will allow us to accomplish three key goals first it will allow us to reduce product costs which can have a meaningful impact on our gross margin in the coming years second it will facilitate higher in stock levels of these goods which should help to drive sales and third it will allow us to control our own destiny in fresh foods most notably by distributing perishables ourselves we can carry more of the fresh products and brands our customers want these include better for you items and national brands today there are many items we cannot cost effectively procure through our current model in addition self distribution will allow us to offer a wider selection of our own private brands to provide our customers with even more compelling value overall we expect dg fresh to allow us to do a better job of tailoring our product selection to fit the needs of our customers particularly in rural areas while our initial focus is on distributing the types of fresh and frozen products we already carry this approach also provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more of our stores in the future we launched this initiative early in calendar year 2019 and we are currently distributing to approximately 300 stores in the northeast from a new cold storage facility we own in pottsville pennsylvania by the end of this fiscal year our goal is to be serving as many as 5 000 stores from up to four new dg fresh distribution facilities beyond 2019 our goal is to fully implement dg fresh initiative chainwide within three to four years as an annual roll out phase similar to what you see in 2019 as john mentioned the start up cost for dg fresh will be a headwind to sg a this year however we expect this initiative to be meaningfully accretive to sales and operating margin over time the transition to self distribution has been relatively smooth which is a testament to the strong relationships we have with our vendors the support of our distributors and our proven ability to execute complex projects we are excited about the potential for this initiative the second new strategic initiative we re introducing today is fast track fast track is a two pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability driving our performance higher in these areas will be foundational to our ability to execute on our buy online pickup in store pilot later this year in addition we believe that our success with fast track over the long term can create significant sg a savings the first key component of fast track involves streamlining the stocking process in our stores which we call one touch unloading this new approach is designed to make stocking shelves simpler and faster reducing the amount of labor needed to complete this task it will begin with fundamental changes at the distribution centers where we will make which will make processes even more store friendly with products and deliveries sorted by location within the store our focus is on reducing the amount of time spent stocking the shelves following the truck delivery allowing us to get products on the shelves more quickly we also believe we can reduce the amount of time that our store associates spend restocking shelves in between deliveries the second component of fast track is self checkout option this self checkout will allow customers to scan and pay for their items with little to no assistance needed from our associates dollar general is known for value and convenience and our customers have told us that speed of checkout is vitally important to their in store experience ultimately fast track should help boost on shelf availability and free up labor hours that we can dedicate to other in store priorities such as customer experience our goal is to pilot fast track in several of our distribution centers and select stores during 2019 following the pilot we will determine the best plan for our broader rollout like the dg fresh initiative fast track will also have an upfront cost that will impact sg a at scale however we believe this initiative will be accretive to our sg a profile and well worth the investment these are just a few examples of how we continue to be an innovative leader in our channel we are excited about these long term strategic growth initiatives which are fully aligned with our ongoing commitment to our four operating priorities as you will recall our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth we have a robust pipeline of initiatives in place to drive growth in 2019 our most impactful merchandising initiative continues to be our cooler door expansion as we head into 2019 this remains a significant opportunity coolers are a great traffic driver and they allow us to offer even more of the products our customers want in fiscal 2019 we plan to install more than 40 000 cooler doors across our store base in 2018 we launched our better for you initiative which introduced healthier food options in more than 2500 stores this offering was in direct response the conversations with our customers who told us they want a healthier options at affordable prices we are pleased with the initial customer reception and the performance of this product set we intend to offer the better for you products in approximately 6 000 stores by the end of 2019 our new good smart private brand has gained traction with our customers and we are positioned as a core product line in better for you in addition to good smart launch in 2018 we had great success with the launch of studio selection our aspirational health and beauty private brand in 2019 we are planning a similar private brand launch in baby products i m also excited to announce that we will be launching a new private brand in cosmetics in april we remain dedicated to the beauty category at dollar general and we believe we can continue to take share from all classes of trade having a premier private brand is an important part of our strategy the new dg private brand will be called believe and we will include an inspiring lineup of attractively priced cosmetics that we think will be appealing to our customers this cosmetic line is just one part of our ongoing efforts to capture share in the health and beauty category from efforts focused on the growing bath body segment to enhancing the shopping experience in this section of the store with more intuitive signing and product placement we have a lot of opportunity to drive hba sales across private brand we continue to believe we can increase sales and penetration which could have a meaningful impact on both gross margin and sales growth over the long term in 2018 we conducted a holistic review of our private brand portfolio and are incorporating what we ve learned into our 2019 go to market plan in addition to sales driving initiatives we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance gross margin in 2019 we intend to roll out electronic article surveillance units to approximately 3 000 stores we expect to complete this rollout by the end of the second quarter bringing the total for the chain to approximately 13 000 beyond this ongoing near term opportunity i d like to give you a brief update on other longer term gross margin opportunities first within distribution and transportation we have continued to execute our strategy to reduce stem miles i am proud to note that our distribution center in longview texas began shipping in january and it is ramping up very quickly and we expect our distribution center in amsterdam new york to begin shipping later this year as of the end of 2018 we successfully expanded our private fleet to approximately 200 tractors up from 80 at the end of 2017 in 2019 we plan to expand our private fleet further while this fleet remains a small piece of our overall transportation needs we believe it continues to provide strategic flexibility finally foreign sourcing remains a long term gross margin opportunity we are specifically focused on diversifying country of origin as well as growing overall foreign sourcing penetration we believe there are many countries around the world where we can source goods at even greater value for our customers our second operating priority is capturing growth opportunities as we enter 2019 our proven high return low risk model for real estate growth is a core strength of the business we have a long standing track record of successfully opening hundreds of stores every year that meet our strict return thresholds the flexibility of our model has allowed us to invest in new formats store growth and a remodel program all with strong returns that contribute significantly to our growth our store format innovation allows us to expand our addressable market opportunity as well this innovation will continue to play a key role in 2019 as we plan to open 975 new stores that serve communities across the country our real estate model continues to focus on five metrics these metrics help us determine that new store growth remains one of the best uses of our capital we continue to see great results with new store sales performing at nearly 100 of pro forma expectations and returns near the high end of our 20 to 22 goal we are proud of our track record for executing successful real estate projects in 2018 we completed a total of 2 065 real estate projects 65 more than we had originally anticipated for fiscal year 2019 we plan to remodel 1 000 mature stores and relocate 100 stores we expect approximately 500 remodels to be in the dollar general traditional plus or dgtp format we also expect to add produce to approximately 200 stores the majority of which will be dgtp remodels as a reminder our traditional remodel stores which have approximately 22 cooler doors deliver a 4 to 5 comp lift on average in year one and dgtp remodels with approximately 34 cooler doors delivers a 10 to 15 comp lift on average in year one dgtps with produce are at the high end of this range over the past two years we have conducted an exhaustive pilot of our dgx stores and during that time we have refined and enhanced the concept we are now confident that we can drive profitability in the smaller box and we plan to open approximately 10 dgx format stores this year dgx stores are about half the size of a traditional dollar general and have a product selection that is tailored to vertical living customers particularly millennials we are excited about these plans for continued growth and innovation in 2019 our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator over the years we have established a clear and defined process to control spending this process has served us well and the entire organization has embraced the cost control mindset in our stores we continue to manage expenses through the efforts such as optimizing product assortment reducing operating complexity and reducing product movement within the stores one of the reasons we are so excited about our fast track initiative is that we believe it has potential to be a significant and incremental driver of store level efficiency our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage our ongoing dialog with our employees is critical and we learn from these conversations to reinforce our position as an employer of choice in 2018 we greatly expanded our benefits to include those that resonate most with our employees including paid parental leave for mothers and fathers adoption assistance and day 1 access to healthcare benefits for store managers we also launched new training programs including a private fleet driver training program for distribution center employees to complement other existing educational benefits such as tuition assistance and college course credit for store manager training and i am very proud to announce that for the eighth consecutive year dollar general was named to training magazine s top 125 training list ranking number 1 overall on this the most recent 2019 list in 2019 we are expanding our benefits to include day 1 eligibility for telehealth benefits for all employees in our organization our part time employees told us they need help assessing affordable healthcare and we believe this will be a valuable benefit we always monitor the wage environment carefully and believe we are well positioned across the organization as illustrated by robust applicant flow at every level our investment in store manager wages and training continued to pay dividends in 2018 and we finished the year with our lowest store manager turnover rate on record we are also doing very well at the store level where we are seeing our time to fill open positions at all time best levels for the company we think our competitive compensation and benefit package is compelling but we believe that the opportunity to build a long term career with a growing retailer is the most important currency we have to attract and retain talent in 2019 we plan to create approximately 8 000 net new jobs this growth creates an environment where employees have opportunities to advance to higher paying and higher responsibility jobs in a relatively short amount of time being an employer of choice is a priority for us and we will continue to seek out opportunities to enhance our employee experience in closing 2018 was a very good year for dollar general the business is in great shape as we enter 2019 and we are excited about the future as john mentioned our long term goal generally remains to deliver double digit adjusted eps growth to do this we need to make smart business decisions that focus both on growing the top line and capturing incremental operating margin where and when we can today i have highlighted how our progress on our initiatives and operating priorities contributed to a great 2018 looking ahead we believe we are making the right long term strategic investments from a position of strength with our business model that leverages our real estate acumen low cost operating experience and our laser focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers we believe that dollar general s business is differentiated from the rest of the retail landscape i believe we have the best team in consumable retail and i hold each person on my senior team accountable for delivering today and planning for tomorrow s growth i am confident that no one on the team will be satisfied with anything less i am proud of the team s innovative approach to retailing the strategic initiatives they have put forth in motion and the financial performance we are driving we continue to be the leader within our channel we believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to reach our goals finally a heartfelt thanks to each and every one of our more than 135 000 employees for the hard work that they do every day which allows us to fulfill our mission of serving others with that operator i d now like to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question will come from vincent sinisi with morgan stanley please go ahead todd vasos chief executive officer good morning vincent j sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions so just wanted to go of course to the incremental investments on the initiatives this year with obviously still early stages around fresh and whatnot can you just give us a little bit more of a sense for that 50 million specifically like how much at least directionally of maybe a lift to the comps do you think that could provide earlier on and then how much of that maybe recurring as you ramp some of these initiatives going forward i guess you know obviously everyone kind of on the line today is just saying new kind of ok a bit below the double digit growth algorithm for this year but when can that maybe return if that s of course helpful context john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer okay couple of questions there i ll start with the first one around the initiatives as you look at the initiatives as we said we see these as being accretive as early as next year the two new ones we talked about are fast track and fresh we re very excited about both as you look at fresh we see both of them helping the top line and the bottom line as you look at fresh the immediate impact we see from that is helping our gross margin helping reduce our product cost now that does come with upfront expenses particularly in sg a and there is a trade off for sg a for gross margin but we re very excited about what that can do not only to our costs but then also our flexibility and longer term what that could mean in terms of as we expand our fresh offerings and in stock availability there we think that can be a meaningful sales driver on fast track that has two parts to that you have the self checkout piece and then you have the one touch shelf stocking piece the latter will have the more immediate impact and we re starting to do that now and we will scale that over the course of the year the self checkout will take a little bit more time with the technology involved in driving the adoption on that so these are sizable investments this year they ll pressure the sg a but as we look out we see them as being accretive as early as next year having a meaningful impact on our overall operating margin eps growth and really positioning us with the long term in mind to drive double digit eps growth over the long term vincent j sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay all right perfect that s helpful and then if i could last quarter you guys had mentioned and we ve been getting quite a bit of questions around it just kind of your internal surveys the confidence was looking a little bit shaky potentially for kind of later this year but it was nice to see of course in the release today that ticket and traffic were both positive so any updates there any work any thoughts around what you re seeing the basket around the health that would be great todd vasos chief executive officer yeah vinny i would tell you we talk to our core customer each and every quarter and while she is feeling better about having a little bit more money in her pocket she continues to tell us that it is definitely from productivity meaning working more hours and in some cases multiple jobs but what she is also telling us is that she is feeling a little less confident than she was at the middle of last year to the end of last year which gives us a little bit of pause from the standpoint that we think that our core customers starting to weaken a little bit which obviously we do very well in all economic cycles so we re positioning ourselves for the back half of the year for a little weaker consumer as we move through the year vincent j sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay all right that s helpful thank you guys good luck operator the next question is from matthew boss with jpmorgan please go ahead matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great thanks so maybe can you speak to the proactive promotional actions that you took in the fourth quarter any higher level changes in the competitive landscape that drove the change and just how best to think about markdowns and gross margin in 2019 todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i ll start and then turn it over to john for 2019 we really went after some targeted markdowns in q4 as you know q4 has the highest traffic counts across retail not only at dollar general and we ve got a track record here of working the price levers pretty well and we know which ones to work for the stickiness of the customer meaning we pulled some promotional levers in the fourth quarter that we believe will sustain that traffic growth in the q1 without having to be nearly as aggressive and we saw we went added from a position of strength and we saw real opportunity to take share as we went through q4 it did exactly what we thought it would do and positions us very well going into the first quarter here in 2019 john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer and as todd said with this helping drive traffic and taking share in our belief that we can retain these customers we believe we re very well positioned going into 2019 to further optimize our promotional activity while at the same time driving profitable sales and traffic so we feel we re very well positioned matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great and then just a follow up on same store sales so how best to think about the cadence this year relative to the 2 5 for the year it sounds like we should anticipate the first half better than the back half just given what you ve seen in your surveys but have you seen the momentum continue in the first quarter despite tax refunds and some pressures that others have cited todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i d start by saying the fundamentals are very strong we re really pleased with the impact that our initiatives are having and the share we are taking there is a bit of a timing impact to start the year we talked about the benefit from the acceleration of snap payments from early q1 into late q4 that did have a bit of an impact on the beginning of the quarter not necessarily dollar for dollar but i would draw that timing to your attention other than that it s a pretty smooth year in our minds and everything is firing on all cylinders matthew boss jpmorgan analyst that s great best of luck todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from rupesh parikh with oppenheimer please go ahead todd vasos chief executive officer good morning rupesh rupesh parikh oppenheimer company analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just going back to your commentary in the press release about generally double digit eps growth going forward is that more of a reflection this year is going to be below 10 then you expect to get back to potentially next year and beyond or is there something that changes your confidence in that metric todd vasos chief executive officer no the comment we made there and i ll start by saying we continue to see ourselves as double digit eps growers over the long term that comment just meant to say that we reserve the right in some years to make targeted investments to drive that long term growth and protect the 10 growth rupesh parikh oppenheimer company analyst great and then just on gross margins i appreciate the color that you provided on q1 so it sounds like we should expect as comparisons get easier that decline versus what we see in q1 to progressively get better as the year progresses is that the right way you guys are thinking about the cadence john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think you re thinking about that s the right way we ve talked about a couple of pressures at the beginning of the year one of the things we talked about is changes to inventory replenishment we ve seen a very high correlation between on shelf availability and sales and as such we re making an investment at the beginning of the year bringing more inventory and to make sure we re right in stock this will have a q1 price tag due to the impact on product mix but as we cycle through that that ll normalize the other thing is as the year progresses we expect to start to see some benefits from the initiatives we re putting in place like fresh and others to enhance gross margin so as you look at the year on a year over year comparison we expect that to improve as the year progresses rupesh parikh oppenheimer company analyst great thank you operator the next question is from michael lasser with ubs todd vasos chief executive officer good morning michael lasser ubs analyst thanks a lot good morning todd thanks a lot for taking my question so if you re successful with some of the initiatives that you re rolling out this year should we expect you to accelerate the rollout of them next year since the 2020 would be another year of sub 10 eps growth todd vasos chief executive officer michael thanks for the question as you know here at dollar general we do everything very methodically and we make sure that it has a solid return before we move to a broad scale roll out in saying that we really like what we see from dg fresh early on and we have great confidence in our fast track momentum as well especially around some of the digital efforts of that we have to include the self checkout option that will be coming in saying that as john indicated we believe that these initiatives will become accretive as we move into next year so should help offset some of those pressures as we continue a broader scale rollout a little bit of a pay as you go if you will type of a rollout schedule michael lasser ubs analyst so just to clarify you re looking at 2019 as more of a transitional year returning to the algorithm over the longer run next year john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer there is as we indicated there is start up cost associated with this and as we start to scale these as todd said it s more as a pay for itself as it goes and we expect these to be accretive as early as 2020 michael lasser ubs analyst okay and then could you break down the gross margin from the fourth quarter in a bit more detail you outlined the promotion what piece of the gross margin drag was that and then initial markups are now a drag on gross margin how did that work john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah walking through last year we articulated the specific q4 drivers but i guess stepping back and taking a broader look if you look at the full year our gross margin was down 32 basis points but we are very pleased with the results where we drove traffic we took share delivered very good comps we did invest the margin in opportunistically in promotional activity as todd mentioned but is clearly resonated with our customers allowed us to take share that was a very high take rate here and help us deliver the sales and we believe that this will stick and we ll be in a position next year to rationalize these investments the other impact with snap while that did benefit our sales with that pull forward there was a mix impact that came with in general lower mix of those additional sales and then the team managed through the headwinds of tariffs in transportation costs as we go into this year as we said we believe we re very well positioned that we can throttle back be even more targeted on our promotional activity while still driving traffic and sales we believe we have opportunities to increase margin over time with the new initiatives like dg fresh and the nci initiative shrink where we ve had nine quarters of year over year improvement and the other levers that we ve talked about we think we re very well positioned michael lasser ubs analyst okay thank you very much and good luck with the year todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from peter keith with piper jaffray please go ahead peter keith piper jaffray analyst hi thanks good morning everyone i wanted to dig into the comp that you re getting from new stores and from remodels historically that s been in a range of 1 5 to 2 but it s interesting with dgtp acceleration and some of the fresh initiatives seems like there s an accelerated lift i m curious if you re starting to move to the high end of that 1 5 to 2 range or are you potentially above it sort of a structural impact to your comp todd vasos chief executive officer thanks for the question i would tell you that we re very happy with not only our new store pipeline but our remodel relocation pipelines as well and i think you re thinking of it right in that because of the ramp up of our remodels especially in the dgtp format to include produce in many of those stores we re closer to the high end i wouldn t say that we have broken out of that the range that we talk about but we re more at the high end of that range with some of the work that we ve done peter keith piper jaffray analyst okay thank you i did want to dig into a little bit on how you re talking about the accretion benefits in 2020 from the growth initiatives i guess in reality when we look back at the last three years the guidance for 2018 you really haven t been at 10 earnings growth in any of the years if you exclude the tax changes so are you seeing that do you think you will be at 10 plus by 2020 and that these are all initiatives as a whole will be accretive to next year john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i ll just reiterate that over the long term we see ourselves as double digit eps growers we re not giving specific guidance in 2020 at this point but we do feel very good about the initiatives and their ability to be accretive next year as you look at the fundamentals of the business model we feel very good about what we re seeing from our new store growth with the great returns and the sales from those with what we re seeing on a comp basis with the performance of the initiatives and the comps we are seeing we see as we said a lot of opportunities over the long term to improve our operating margin we really look at operating margin overall and we believe we re making the right investments here to enhance that operating margin it comes at a little bit of a cost now but we believe this positions us better for the future we continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash which allows us to reinvest in these business while paying back significant amount to shareholders through share repurchases so we don t see the future differently peter keith piper jaffray analyst okay thank you very much and good luck todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from ed kelly with wells fargo please go ahead edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst hi guys good morning todd vasos chief executive officer good morning edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst i just want to start going with clarification when you talked about the impact of snap in february not having the same dollar for dollar impact are you saying that the headwind in february was not as big as the benefit that you saw in january todd vasos chief executive officer that s exactly what we re saying we have not seen a dollar for dollar impact i think that really goes to what i talked about earlier some of those investments we made in markdown being very sticky and we know our customer very well and when you get to change her shopping patterns she sticks with that and we saw that as we moved into q1 edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst and then just curious as to i know you only have a couple of weeks but how march has looked given that things kind of normalize there refund seems to be picking up and then just one other question about all this did you mention that there were some conservatism built into the comp guidance around the back half of the year i m not sure if i heard that right todd vasos chief executive officer i ll take the first one but we really aren t talking really much about q1 right now obviously but i would frame it this way we feel very confident in our top line sales due to all of the initiatives that we have in play including the investment we made in q4 and just keep in mind march has an easter shift in it i think that s important toward the end of the month but for us we ll equalize as we move through april so we re bullish about the quarter but we have a lot of quarter left to go and john you may want to address the other one john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah other than the timing impact we mentioned the overall year comp we guided to reflect our current view of the year edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst okay and then todd just one quick follow up for you on dg fresh why now on this on self distribution and can you just help us understand the benefits like what type of margin opportunity is here from doing this yourself like why does in stocks improve with more frequent deliveries and why don t you tell us about your plans for fresh todd vasos chief executive officer yeah so why now i think the best way to answer that is that we continue to expand our cooler program here it s been one of the biggest traffic drivers and one of our biggest comp drivers that we ve seen we have a series of distributors out there today across the country and those distributors do a nice job for us but it comes at a cost and that cost is very high as you can imagine in many cases a full service program so we see a real opportunity from a position of strength right now to take that in house and control your own destiny and the way we see sales and margin enhancements here is a couple of ways number one on margin not having to pay that very hefty up charge we re going to build a bank the majority of that with a little labor that we re putting in the stores to help work the goods again coming off of the full service program but margins will be very accretive with this program and then the second thing is sales what you re going to see is our ability one to stay in stock number two longer term what you re going to find from us as i mentioned in my prepared remarks is going to be a different assortment that s going to really take into account a lot of our private brand offerings which will help our margins and our sales but also on items that we don t carry today because of the distributor network that we have so we re very excited about this this is probably one of the biggest margin opportunities we will have shorter term to really move the needle here edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator the next question will come from scot ciccarelli with rbc capital markets please go ahead scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst hi guys i guess i m still little confused on some of the markdown commentary so i know you guys have talked about the pricing environment being pretty benign and you re comfortable with where your pricing is so can you help us understand little bit better why you engaged in that promotional activity that you did number one number two how does it benefit 1q even as you pull back promotions i guess i m a little confused on that thanks todd vasos chief executive officer yes sure so as the way we look at customer and customer traffic again as i mentioned we talk to our customer every quarter what she was telling us is that she was feeling a little weaker than she was middle of the year and we took an opportunity from a position of strength to take share we saw where we could take share in many different dmas across the country and we thought the best way to do that which turned out to work pretty nicely was to do it on a promotional basis because we feel very confident in our everyday shelf pricing that we have today and so we did it on a promotional basis and we know this customer very well we know if we can change her shopping patterns especially in the busy fourth quarter when we have her attention it is she s very sticky she ll stay with us and i think we ve seen some of that as we entered q1 evidenced by the not for dollar to dollar trade off back on snap as an example so we believe that it did exactly what we thought and we ve said in the past we reserve the right to go in and make these investments periodically to continue to drive traffic and continue to take share and that s exactly what we did in q4 scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then just curious was traffic positive kind of throughout the quarter todd vasos chief executive officer yeah it was pretty stable throughout the quarter at the back half a little stronger than the first but i would tell you we re pleased overall with the traffic in q4 scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst great thanks a lot guys operator the final question will come from robbie ohmes with bank of america please go ahead robert ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey thanks for taking my question todd i was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the long term profit outlook of dg fresh so can you just sort of create a picture for us if you do roll this out over the next three to four years how does the income statement change are you expecting a sort of a secularly higher gross margin and kind of permanently higher expense ratio and what are the kind of long term assumptions about what store sales productivity levels have to be to make this all work on a large scale basis and you ve mentioned some how you re taking more of your distribution in house a little bit i mean does that have to accelerate more significantly to support being doing fresh on a very large scale basis maybe just help us understand that the 4 the three year to five year outlook for how much this could change your entire store base it s probably more complicated to operate this category as well thanks todd vasos chief executive officer yeah that s a great question and i would first start by saying that as we look at the dg fresh initiative we see a real opportunity to drive both the top line and the margin so i would look at it this way it will be a significant margin driver as we move into 2020 and beyond and that s really driven primarily off of the distributor cost that we pay today which has a substantial up charge attached to it substantial and as we work with our vendors which we ve got relationships with all of them what we re finding in the first 300 stores in first dc that we put in were substantial reductions in cost of goods to move the product into our own dcs and distribute it ourselves so i think you need to look at it that way on the top line i think it ll be a meaningful top line contributor as well as we continue to be better in stock because we can we know how to distribute goods fresh shelf stable whatever it may be controlling our own destiny there gives us high confidence that we can execute at a much higher level than we were seeing across the country we had some distribution voids quite frankly across the country and we still do with our distributor network because it is so complex and so large by taking it in house we believe it will simplify our network and be able to execute that much better and as you continue to look out we see opening these dcs about the same pace as 2019 so an average of 5 000 to 6 000 stores a year for the foreseeable future until we re built out and we believe that these fresh distribution centers there we will be able to leverage as well some of our dry goods that perhaps we can deliver out of there as well taking some of the pressure off of our larger dcs so we believe it s a win win across the board which should see substantial p l ramifications on a positive side as we move into 2020 and then beyond robert ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst terrific best of luck thanks todd vasos chief executive officer thanks you operator ladies and gentlemen we

shipping inc for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 our performance strengthened significantly during the recent quarter and year as reflected in higher time charter revenues and the dramatic turnaround in profitability this is the result of the patient and focused strategy we have persistently followed over many years which position the company to take advantage of improving industry conditions in addition we took steps to fortify our balance sheet in 2018 while also demonstrating our strong belief in the company by conducting a self tender offer lastly we have continued to actively manage our fleet profile to optimize our mix of vessels and maintain our operational and financial flexibility to summarize our financial results diana shipping inc reported net income of 2 9 million and net income attributed to common stockholders of 1 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 this represents a turnaround from a net loss of 436 9 million and a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 438 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 which included a 422 5 million impairment loss for the full year 2018 net income was 16 6 million and net income attributed to common stockholders was 10 8 this was a significant improvement compared with the net loss of 511 7 million and a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 517 5 million including the impairment loss for 2017 time charter revenues rose to 62 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 from 48 9 million for the same quarter of 2017 mainly due to the increased average time charter rates that we have achieved for our vessels time charter revenues were 226 2 million for the full year of 2018 up from 161 9 million for 2017 turning to the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled a healthy 151 4 million at december 31 2018 long term debt net of deferred financing cost including the current portion was 530 5 million compared to stockholders equity of more than 627 7 million the company enhanced its financial flexibility during the 2018 fourth quarter by redeeming all of the outstanding 8 5 senior notes due 2020 at the aggregate principal amount of approximately 63 25 million this was made possible in part by our issuance during the third quarter of 100 million private placement of senior unsecured bonds maturing in september 2023 reflecting our commitment to return value to shareholders at the end of december 2018 the company completed the self tender offer to purchase up to 4 166 666 shares of our outstanding common stock at a price of 3 6 per share the board of directors determined that repurchasing the shares was in the company s best interest given our cash position and stock price in connection with our active management of the company s fleet in the 2018 fourth quarter we agreed to sell two vessels the alcyon for a sale price of 7 45 million before commissions and the triton for a sale price of 7 35 million before commissions in early 2019 we announced agreements to sell the vessels naias and dione at a sale price of 7 2 million each all four of these vessels were 2001 built and were among the oldest vessels in fleet we will continue to manage our fleet in a responsible manner that promotes a balance of time charter maturities and produces a predictable revenue stream as we look ahead in 2019 we will continue the prudent management of our financial position and our fleet and we ll maintain our focus on delivering value to our shareholders with that i ll now turn the call over to our president anastasios margaronis for a perspective on industry conditions he will then be followed by our chief financial officer andreas michalopoulos who will provide a more detailed financial overview thank you anastasios c margaronis president thank you simon and welcome to all the participants of this quarterly conference call of diana shipping inc last year started off on a very positive note in the bulk area market but things began to deteriorate and the market lost its gains and more toward the end of the year proof of this is baltic dry index which started the year at 1 282 and stood at only 637 on february 25 the baltic cape index moved from 1 987 to 520 over the same period and the baltic panamax index stood at 1 391 on january 2 closing yesterday at only 608 since mid october last year panamax rates are down by 52 while capesize rates are also down 32 over the same period let s start with macroeconomic developments which usually have a role to play in the medium to long term fortunes of the shipping industry in the eurozone the economy grew 1 8 in 2018 the imf predicts growth will slow down to a maximum of 1 6 this year with downside risks present in 2018 the chinese economy grew by 6 6 that was the slowest pace since 1990 but the comparison becomes rather meaningless if you look back in the context of the overall size of the chinese economy in 2018 and in 1990 for 2019 growth is expected to come in at 6 2 developing economies on the other hand grew at a brisk 4 6 in 2018 the imf expects growth to slow down to about 4 5 this year overall world gdp growth in 2018 was 3 7 and this rate of growth is expected to come down to 3 5 this year starting with steel now looking at commodities according to howe robinson chinese steel production rose nearly 10 in 2018 on the back of strong expansion in real estate and ongoing government infrastructure project howe robinson expects chinese steel production to fall in 2019 however they cite state sponsored projects such as the recently announced 125 billion rail network expansion to limit the extent of any decline steel stock piles in china at the end of december were approximately 9 2 million ton which was about 100 000 tonnes less than at the same time in 2017 turning to demand now for shipping overall according to clarksons total bulk carrier trade in 2018 reached the 29 339 trillion ton miles an increase of 2 8 compared to 2017 in 2019 they estimate that volumes will increase by 3 4 to reach 30 343 trillion ton miles in 2021 volumes are estimated to increase by 2 8 ph looking at iron ore now according to clarksons global seaborne iron ore trade is estimated to have contracted marginally to 1 47 billion tonnes in 2018 largely reflecting weaker shipments to china this was mainly caused by more scrap use in the countries of steel industry and a drawdown in port inventories in 2019 chinese iron ore imports are expected to increase by around 2 as the sharp drawdown in inventories seen last year is not expected to be repeated and the consumption of scrapping china s blast furnaces might fall back from the level seen last year the latter could be caused through the arrival of more high quality steel in the markets according to banchero costa the outlook for chinese iron ore imports in 2019 remains worried as higher iron ore prices and lower steel prices have cut into steel mill profit margins discouraging the steel mills from ramping up output and restocking raw materials according to clarksons following the disaster caused by the collapse over vale s corrego do feijao dam vale announced that 40 million tonnes per annum of iron ore production will be suspended to allow for the decommissioning of 10 000 dams over the next three years as a result overall brazilian iron ore shipments could be between 5 million tonnes and 50 ph million tonnes per year weaker than earlier projections this would amount to about 1 of seaborne iron ore trade or 0 3 ph of total annual bulk trade the interesting question is to try and determine where the shortfall in projected iron ore shipments might come from and what effect that would have on the overall ton mile demand for capes it is quite certain though that business for the vale sized bulkers would be negatively affected as a result of this disaster we need to keep in mind that these ships cannot be employed in any other routes but those envisaged by vale when they were design built as for coking coal now holding against to clarksons total world imports of coking coal could reach 275 million tonnes this year an increase of 3 compared to 2018 in 2020 the estimate is set at 282 million tonnes which would be a further increase of 2 inaudible chinese import demand and potentially weaker prices represent downside risks so do european union seaborne coking coal imports which are expected to show only marginal growth in the coming years thermal coal according to clarksons thermal coal imports are estimated to increase by 2 this year and reach 996 million tonnes and about 1 growth in 2020 this year china is expected to remain the world s largest seaborne steam coal importer although volumes are expected to fall slightly year on year when significant downside risks are present as mentioned below according to howe robinson the chinese government imposed restrictions on thermal coal imports from mid november onwards according to banchero costa india continues to have strong coal imports as domestic production shortfalls domestic logistics bottlenecks regulations targeting pollution cuts and surging demand for power from household electrification lead to higher imports from suppliers in indonesia south africa and the united states on top of all the above according to comodo research at the beginning of february china s six major coastal power plants had 14 7 million tonnes of coal in stock pile which was 50 higher than a year ago turning to grain cargos in the 2018 2019 grain season clarksons expected the grain imports to reach 500 million metric tonnes which if it materializes will be an increase of 4 in 2019 2020 the expectation is for a further increase of 3 to 515 million metric tonnes according to banchero costa global soybean trade is expected to contract by 0 7 in 2018 to 2019 grain mainly as lower chinese imports due to us trade tensions outweigh an increase in european imports turning to the supply now of tonnage newbuilding deliveries last year were 27 3 million deadweight compared with 37 1 million deadweight in 2017 this year newbuilding deliveries are expected to reach 37 million to 38 million deadweight comodo research are concerned by the fact that while in 2018 about 297 vessels were delivered this year the number is expected to be in the 330 to 430 range unless demolitions increase so as to compensate for this extra newbuilding tonnage supply might become an issue for the dry bulk market by increasing well over 3 which is currently anticipate by most analysts clarksons estimate fleet growth of 3 this year with fundamental looking fairly balanced with downside demand risks as mentioned already banchero costa also expects fleet growth of 3 for this year assuming demolition activity increases from its record low level seen in 2018 in line with expected increases in newbuilding deliveries this year clarksons believe that supply growth could be limited by the impact of the january 2020 global sulphur cap with bulk carriers out of commission to fit scrubbers absorbing about 0 5 of bulk fleet capacity across 2019 scrapping last year s demolition volumes of 4 million deadweight were the lowest seen for 10 years in 2017 13 6 million deadweight worth of capacity was scrapped in 2019 banchero costa expect the scrapping to reach at least 10 million deadweight tonne with scrapping slowing down significantly in 2018 to just over 4 million deadweight tonne the average age of the bulk carrier fleet went up from 9 1 years at the end of 2017 to 9 6 years last december a quick look at the order book now according to clarksons at the end of last year there were 88 5 million deadweight tons worth of ships on order representing 11 of the bulk carrier fleet the capesize order book was 49 9 million deadweight tons which was 15 of the existing fleet and 20 9 million deadweight tons of panamax s were on order the equivalent of 10 of the existing fleet nearly half of this newbuilding tonnage is scheduled for delivery this year while the rest will be delivered in 2020 and beyond so what kind of an outlook do analysts provide us with all these data comodo research are rather bearish on the prospects of the world economy and for the dry bulk market as a whole they point out that the vale incident is a new headwind for the capesize market that will require continued evaluation the positive news they cite in this sector is the arrest of an elderly vloc conversion this might reveal problems known in some circles for a while now about the structural integrity of these ships it is possible that the further trading of these vessels might be suspended if the supply and demand forecast described earlier unmaterialize this year rates should improve from their present depressed levels on the other hand clarksons report that while overall demand supply outlook for the bulk carrier sector in 2019 looks broadly balanced a number of significant downside risks to the demand side are clear these range from global economic concerns to uncertainty over the outlook of china s coal and iron ore imports clarksons counter balanced these negative factors by pointing out that increased demolition and vessel of higher time for scrubber retrofits mentioned earlier could have a positive impact on this note we will pass the call over to our cfo andreas michalopoulos who will provide us with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter of last year and for 2018 as a whole thank you andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer thank you stasi and good morning i am pleased to be discussing today with you diana s operational results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 net income and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to 2 9 million and 1 5 million respectively earnings per common share were 0 01 time charter revenues increased to 62 9 million compared to 48 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was due to the increased average time charter rates that we achieved for our vessels during the quarter this increase was partly offset by a decreasing revenues due to the sale of the vessels alcyon and triton in december 2018 ownership days were 4 554 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 4 624 in the same quarter of 2017 fleet utilization was 99 1 compared to 98 9 for the same quarter of 2017 and the daily time charter equivalent rate was 13 527 compared to 9 949 for the same quarter of 2017 voyage expenses were 2 7 million for the quarter compared to 3 million for the same quarter of 2017 and the decrease in voyage expenses was due to a gain from bunkers of 0 7 million compared to a loss of 0 5 million in the same quarter of 2017 vessel operating expenses amounted to 25 2 million compared to 24 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased by 5 the increase was due to increasing insurances repairs and maintenance costs of the vessels and taxes daily operating expenses were 5 536 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 5 195 for the same quarter of 2017 representing an increase of 7 depreciation and amortization of deferred charges amounted to 13 million general and administrative expenses were 9 million compared to 8 2 million for the same quarter last year the increase was mainly due to increased payroll and training costs and the exchange rate of euro to us dollars management fees to related party were 0 6 million compared to 0 5 million last year due to the increased average number of vessels managed by diana wilhelmsen interest and finance costs amounted to 9 million compared to 6 8 million in the same quarter of 2017 this increase was attributable to increased average interest rates in the quarter compared to the same quarter of 2017 and was partly offset by decreased average debt interest and other income amounted to 0 8 million compared to 1 5 million for the same quarter last year the decrease was due to the repayment of the loan due from diana containerships for the year now ended december 31 2018 net income amounted to 16 6 million and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to 10 8 million earnings per share was 0 10 time charter revenues increased to 226 2 million compared to 161 9 million for 2017 the increase was attributable to increased average time charter rates that we achieved through our vessels during the year less a five ph days compared to 2017 ownership days in 2018 were 18 204 compared to 18 119 fleet utilization was 99 1 compared to 98 2 in 2017 and the

depreciation and amortization of deferred charges amounted to 52 2 million in 2018 general and administrative expenses increased to 29 5 million compared to 26 3 million in 2017 mainly due to increased payroll and training costs increased bod fees and legal fees and the exchange rate of fuel to us dollars management fee to related party was 2 4 million compared to 1 9 million in 2017 the increase was due to an increased average number of vessels managed by diana wilhelmsen during the year compared to 2017 interest and finance costs amounted to 30 5 million compared to 26 6 million in 2017 this increase was attributable to increased average interest rates compared to last year while average debt is decreasing interest and other income amounted to 8 8 million compared to 4 5 million in 2017 this increase was mainly due to the payment of the 5 million discount price which was recorded in income on the date of the loan repayment by diana containerships inc thank you for your attention we would now be pleased to respond to your question and i will turn the call to the operator who will instruct you as to the procedure for asking questions operator thank you sir at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from noah parquette with jpmorgan please state your question noah parquette j p morgan analyst great thanks i just wanted to ask you guys wanted to ask about use of cash flow obviously the tender in q4 that was one drive off because that was kind of pre the vale news and the market moved lower i mean how are you in terms of your comfortable like a liquidity buffer at this point given where rates are i mean would you consider more moves like the tender or taking up the deferred stock or are you kind of want to see a little bit extra liquidity out there ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary no this is ioannis zafirakis speaking we are considering the cash position that we have today to be sufficient on the conservative side of the business i have to say as we were trying to explain earlier we feel that the fare meter is on the high side and there is some justification for being afraid for the demand and certainly there is the thought of the demand going down but we also believe that these may have been a little bit overestimated which has led also supply to be on the low side lower than what should have been and the net effect most probably is going to be much more positive than everybody thinks having said that to answer your question directly we think that the liquidity the cash that we have aside is more than enough and don t forget that we are selling also vessels and therefore a tender offer is not out of the question noah parquette j p morgan analyst okay that s clear and then i just wanted to ask about the 2001 built ships that you re selling one you still have i think one more it s safe to assume that s up on the block too are those just trying to get a sense of or two more are those going to scrap or are those going to trade just to get a sense how scrapping will shape up this year ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary no no those vessels are fully tradable they ve been sold to before the trading andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer the scrap value of those vessels is almost half of what they have been sold for noah parquette j p morgan analyst yes okay great thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from randy giveans with jefferies please state your question randy giveans jefferies analyst yes so two quick questions for me so diana obviously been very active in the time charter market in recent months and it was kind of continuous but is that specifically due to kind of a weaker outlook for short term spot rates or just an ongoing strategic decision to kind of keep rechartering vessels to maintain 75 80 time charter coverage for the next six months to nine months ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary you are closer to the second explanation as we have done since 2005 we keep our strategy the same chartering of our vessels is staggering process we will continue doing that i m not that 100 certain whether it is 70 or 80 that you mentioned it is absolutely correct we don t have such a target in our mind what we have as a target is to have a vessel opening every 15 days or 20 days we are trying our best not to have a lot of vessels opening at the same time and this is what we will continue doing randy giveans jefferies analyst sure okay and then looking at the balance sheet now on kind of where it is currently after some refinancings and whatnot can you provide a quarterly debt amor for this year and maybe for 2020 any big balloons in the near term anastasios c margaronis president yes so as we had stated we had a loan for motor vessel maera which had a balloon and a maturity amount of 12 1 million and that was maturing on the 4th of january this was repaid this loan was repaid and we have the vessel now that is without a mortgage so this was a conscious decision within our strategy to slightly de lever the company we decided to repay that vessel considering motor vessel crystalia and atalandi those two vessels we had a maturing installment a maturing balloon and installment of 21 million that we also repaid a few days ago it was maturing a few days ago on that amount we are nearly concluded to refinance those two vessels as soon as we refinance them you will be the first to know but we are in final stages of refinancing those two vessels for about 19 million for both and finally within our maturities you have a loan for ismene and selina with the maturity amount of around 20 million maturing on the 30th of june we intend to also refinance those two vessels at maturity and this should be absolutely no problem for us to do that last but not least motor vessel houston is maturing at the end of the year with a balloon installment of 4 9 million on the november 19th we have not decided yet what we re going to do at that point in time of the year with that amount what is important for you to know is that we have banks that are there to refinance our vessels and that s point number one and point number two is that we do not want as ioannis said i think at the beginning of the call to diminish our cash balance in the balance sheet we are at the point in the cycle where we are building the balance sheet and the cash in the balance sheet and we intend to do that randy giveans jefferies analyst got it and in kind of just for total debt amor for this year and next year not necessarily including the vessel sales just kind of scheduled debt amor anastasios c margaronis president you will see all that in the 20 f but basically for this year is around 100 million all inclusive and for next year it s about 40 million and a lot in the half for the next six years but i think in a few days you will have the 20 f filing that we will do and you will have all that in greater detail which is most important for you at that time randy giveans jefferies analyst yes excellent and then i guess one quick housekeeping question so yeah congrats on that tender offer now following those share repurchases what is the current share count that we should use for 2019 ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary you want the exact number it s 103 million shares something you want the exact number andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer 103 764 351 randy giveans jefferies analyst 103 764 351 now we re talking all right thanks again gentlemen have it going operator thank you operator instructions ladies and gentlemen there appears to be no additional requests for questions i ll turn it back to management for closing remarks thank you simeon p palios chairman and chief executive officer thank you again for your interest in and support of diana shipping we look forward to speaking with you in the future thank you operator thank you this concludes today s conference all parties may disconnect have a good day duration

daily fx market roundup march 15 2019 kathy lien managing director of fx strategy for bk asset management the ended the week lower against all of the major currencies on the back of softer economic data instead of improving the dropped to a 22 month low in march while grew less than expected the university of michigan increased but the improvement also fell short of expectations in response treasury yields turned lower and the dollar headed south the us dollar has been in an uptrend for most of the quarter but as we head into next week s investors could send the dollar lower no changes are expected from the us central bank but follow every meeting this year and chairman powell s comments could hurt more than help the even though there have been more improvements than deterioration in the us economy since the last central bank meeting the fed is in no rush to raise last week we learned that increased by only 0 2 in january as slowed to 20k in february the housing market has peaked with rising interest rates slowing and home sales growth while and sector activity recovered the us hit an all time high most importantly inflation is low with easing to 1 5 from 1 9 in february so even if the central bank finds the uptick in confidence wages and economic activity encouraging low inflation gives them the flexibility to hold off tightening until there s signs of consistent strength in the economy when the fed last met the plunged after they removed the reference to further gradual rate increases from the monetary policy we don t expect the dollar to crash at this upcoming meeting but we can expect powell to reassert his patient approach on rates which could be enough to encourage profit taking on long dollar positions one of the primary reasons why the dollar outperformed in the first quarter is relative weakness abroad but as some big uncertainties subside money could flow back into riskier currencies and riskier assets britain still doesn t have a brexit deal but at least we know that they won t be spinning out without an agreement slower growth in china has been a big problem for the rest of the world but tax cuts could provide a big boost to the economy the prospect of improvements could make other investments more attractive easing demand for us dollars even as the us economy outperforms in the long run however demand for the greenback should remain strong as the fed continues to be the only major central bank to raise interest rates this year is in an uptrend but if it falls back below 111 we should see a deeper slide toward 110 the bank of japan left unchanged last week but lowered its export and output assessment in response to terrible trade numbers

jennifer and welcome to everyone joining our call we ended 2018 on a strong sales note with a 4 comp in the fourth quarter while we certainly faced various challenges throughout the year we believe 2018 was a great year for our employees our shareholders and we remained squarely focused on taking care of our customers as we head into 2019 we are excited to have so many new opportunities ahead of us during today s call i will cover five main topics i ll start with key highlights from the fourth quarter results then i ll update you on our progress and outlook for our digital and non consumable initiatives third i ll lay out two new strategic initiatives we are excited to be launching fourth i ll give you an update on the results we are achieving with our operating priorities and finally i ll finish with our operating plans for fiscal 2019 john will provide you with some 2018 financial highlights guidance for fiscal 2019 and our perspective on dollar general s long term growth turning to our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial performance we delivered a very strong top line in the fourth quarter with net sales increasing 8 5 to 6 6 billion compared to net sales of 6 1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full fiscal year net sales increased 9 2 to 25 6 billion compared to net sales of 23 5 billion in fiscal 2017 the strong net sales performance throughout fiscal 2018 was balanced between performance from both new stores and mature stores during 2018 we continue to gain market share in highly consumable product sales which was a key driver of our strong sales performance syndicated data shows that we had mid to high single digit growth in both units and dollars over the 4 week 12 week 24 week and 52 week periods ending january 26 2019 for full year comp sales we posted a 3 2 growth rate for fiscal 2018 marking our 29th consecutive year of same store sales growth given the overall strength of the economy in 2018 this continued growth underscores our belief that our business model can perform well in all economic cycles we are proud to continue our legacy of serving the underserved by providing them with the value and convenience that they have come to expect from dollar general as i mentioned we finished the year with a very strong 4 same store sales growth rate in the fourth quarter this growth resulted in our highest two year stack in 21 quarters and our third consecutive quarter of accelerated two year comp stack growth the fourth quarter top line performance was driven by growth in both average transaction amount and customer traffic this quarter s average transaction amount growth included expansion in average unit retail and increased units per basket driving profitable traffic is paramount to the health of our business over the long term this quarter we took steps to continue providing our customers with terrific value and focused on promotional activities that allowed us to take share from multiple classes of trade we believe we can sustain these share gains in 2019 and that these investments attract the customers who will continue to shop at dollar general these actions were especially important in the fourth quarter given the increased seasonal sales volume seen across retail industry during this time of year we achieved our goals of growing traffic and market share and continue to broaden our overall customer base we were also pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth in non consumables we are particularly excited about our performance in the home category which led overall comp growth in the fourth quarter the team is doing a great job in this category which led to our best performance in home in many years this is the first time in quite a while that we ve seen a non consumable category out top consumable growth during the fourth quarter we believe same store sales benefited from the acceleration of february snap payments during the government shutdown based upon our analysis of ebt sales we estimated this created an approximate 70 basis point benefit for same store sales as we head into 2019 we believe we have compelling opportunities to gain more market share drive profitable traffic to our conveniently located stores and deliver more of the products our customer seeks at the value she needs we remain focused on these opportunities and after john s discussion i look forward to sharing how we are targeting our efforts in 2019 with that i will now turn the call over to john john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you todd and good morning everyone i would like to walk you through the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year and then i ll take a few minutes to discuss our fiscal 2019 financial guidance i ll also provide you with some thoughts on our long term business perspective unless i specifically note otherwise all comparisons are year over year as todd already discussed sales i will start with gross profit which as a percentage of sales was 31 2 in the fourth quarter a decrease of 91 basis points this decrease was partially attributable to higher markdowns as todd mentioned this quarter we proactively invested in promotional activity to drive traffic and market share and we believe we remain well positioned against all classes of trade and across all geographies where we operate that said pricing is always competitive in discount retail and we watch the environment very closely in 2019 our strategy is to further optimize our promotional activities as we focus on driving profitable sales and traffic growth gross margin in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower initial markups on inventory purchases an increase in the lifo provision a greater proportion of sales coming from the consumables category which generally has a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories and the sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of sales within the consumables category partially offsetting these items was lower inventory shrink sg a as a percentage of sales was 21 6 a decrease of 34 basis points the decrease was driven by reductions in repairs and maintenance expenses benefits costs and incentive compensation expenses and lower utilities as a percentage of net sales partially offsetting those decreases were approximately 11 7 million in hurricane related expenses due two hurricanes which occurred during the third quarter of 2018 as well as a 2 2 million year over year increase in other disaster related expenses both of which were greater than anticipated in our original fiscal year 2018 forecast as a reminder 2017 fourth quarter sg a expense included costs related to accelerated store closures moving down the income statement our effective tax rate for the quarter was an expense of 21 2 this compares to a negative 18 9 tax rate in the fourth quarter last year which was a benefit the benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities on the balance sheet at the new lower federal corporate tax rate as a result of federal tax reform diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were 1 84 which includes an approximate 0 04 negative impact of disasters the majority of which was driven by hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter turning now to our balance sheet which remains strong at the end of fiscal 2018 merchandise inventories were 4 1 billion at the end of fiscal 2018 up 13 5 overall and an increase of 7 3 on a per store basis over the end of the 2017 fiscal year inventory levels increased in the back half of fiscal 2018 as we brought in inventory to stock our new longview texas distribution center additionally as we discussed with you last quarter we proactively made some strategic and opportunistic forward inventory buys in part due to concerns over potential tariff increases these buys aimed at keeping overall costs low contributed to the higher inventory level at year end as we noted in recent quarters we have been successfully reducing shrink while also increasing on shelf availability this dynamic is difficult to both achieve and maintain in 2019 we are taking action to update our inventory replenishment cycle to support even higher levels of on shelf availability for our customers every day while continuing to take actions designed to further reduce shrink we believe our inventory quality is in great shape and our goal remains to drive inventory growth that is in line with or below our sales growth over time fiscal 2018 was another year of strong cash flow from operations which totaled 2 1 billion an increase of 341 million or 18 9 total capital expenditures for 2018 were 734 million and included our planned investments in new stores remodels and relocations continued investments in construction for two new distribution centers and spending related to the previously announced acceleration of certain key initiatives during the quarter we repurchased 3 4 million shares of our common stock for 360 million and paid a quarterly cash dividend of 0 29 per common share outstanding at a total cost of 75 million for the full year we returned a total of 1 3 billion in capital to shareholders through the combination of share repurchases and cash dividends the remaining repurchase authorization at the end of the fourth quarter was approximately 346 million and yesterday our board approved an additional 1 billion in incremental share repurchase authorization our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and we are focused on financial returns our first priority is investing in high return growth opportunities including new store expansion and infrastructure to support future growth we also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends all while maintaining our current investment grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to ebitdar turning now to fiscal 2019 this year we expect our core business to continue to deliver strong growth and allow us to invest in our ongoing strategic initiatives as well as the two new ones that todd will discuss in greater detail shortly overall our long term financial performance goals remain squarely focused on delivering strong growth in net sales comp store sales operating profit and diluted eps which is also supported by our financial strategies in some years we will balance the decision to invest with delivering on our long term goal of double digit adjusted eps growth we believe that net sales comp store sales operating profit and diluted eps are the core metrics that you should be focusing on in order to gauge our progress i will now provide you with our outlook on these metrics for 2019 for fiscal 2019 we expect net sales growth of approximately 7 and comp sales growth of approximately 2 5 moving on to profitability i d like to share a few insights with you we are of course laser focused on operating profit and operating profit margin in 2019 we expect to grow operating profit by approximately 4 to 6 our goal is to improve operating profit margin over time and we believe we are making the right operating decisions and investments to achieve this goal this year this means that we ll be making investments in strategic initiatives including dg fresh a supply chain initiative as well as fast track and in stock productivity and customer service initiative while both of these initiatives are still in the early test phase we believe these investments will allow us to enhance our operating margin profile over the long term the associate investments however will pressure sg a rates in the near term with this as a backdrop i ll now provide you with a few other insights into overall gross margin and sg a spend for 2019 first the changes to our inventory replenishment cycle that i mentioned earlier will have an initial gross margin price tag mostly due to the impact on product inventory mix in addition there will be a working capital outlays required there is correlation between on shelf availability and sales and we believe these changes will position us to support and drive top line growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond second on transportation while we have seen some signs of stabilization in a more balanced marketplace we anticipate that we could see continued transportation cost increases in 2019 third on tariffs our guidance assumes that the government maintains current tariff levels and the guidance does not contemplate any increases in rates or any additional tariff enactment we believe that the first quarter gross margin will be the most pressured on a year over year basis and that we will see improvements in the year over year comparison as the year progresses regarding sg a we will have start up expenses related to the two new initiatives in addition to ongoing investments in other strategic initiatives in total we expect to spend approximately 50 million on these strategic initiatives in 2019 the majority of which will be in our two new initiatives we expect these investments to pressure sg a particularly in the first half of the fiscal year while these sg a investments should improve gross margin and overall operating margin over time they will move our sg a leverage range above 2 5 to 3 that said we believe these investments will be accretive as early as 2020 given these gross margin and sg a expense factors we expect operating margins to be more pressured during the first half of the year based on these dynamics we are providing fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share guidance of 6 30 to 6 50 our diluted eps guidance assumes an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 22 to 22 5 in 2019 overall our capital spending in 2019 is expected to be approximately 775 million to 825 million as we continued to invest in strategic initiatives and general business need to drive and support future growth in terms of cash distributions to shareholders yesterday our board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0 32 per share which is an increase of approximately 10 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 dividend in fiscal 2019 we plan to repurchase approximately 1 billion of our common stock we are pleased with our strong position as we enter the year and we are very excited for our plans for 2019 as always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent strong financial performance while strategically investing in initiatives for long term growth we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing operating priorities to drive profitable same store sales growth healthy new store returns strong free cash flow and long term shareholder value with that i will turn the call back over to todd todd vasos chief executive officer thank you john i m proud of the team s execution that led to the strong results this year and feel confident that we re making the right investments and operating decisions that will allow us to extend our runway for profitable growth now i d like to spend a few minutes providing you with an update on the progress we have made on our digital and non consumable initiatives and outline two new transformational strategic initiatives that we re launching starting first with digital in 2019 our digital strategy will remain focused on using technology to further enhance the in store experience we are confident that we can use technology to create a more personalized and convenient shopping experience for our customers in 2018 we launched the dg go app which allows customers to use their phones to scan items as they shop see a running total of the items in their basket using our card calculator and then skip the checkout line by using the dg go kiosk the app has been popular with our customers and through the end of fiscal 2018 we had more than 140 000 downloads and exited the year with approximately 25 000 monthly active users despite only having dg go kiosk in approximately 250 stores pending performance data our goal in 2019 will be to expand this offering to more stores we have engaged with our customers to understand how they are using the app to learn how we might improve it further one key learning is that our customers are using the card calculator frequently even when they re not using dg go kiosk to checkout we believe they re using the card calculator stay within their budgets and optimize their shopping dollars based on this we recently launched card calculator in approximately 200 stores throughout the first half of 2019 we intend to roll out this useful tool for our customers in the majority of our stores we have invested and upgraded wifi to facilitate in store use of this and other digital tools having a user friendly and helpful suite of digital tools is becoming increasingly important to our customers and therefore to dollar general we know that our customers who more frequently engage with our digital tools tend to shop with us more often and check out with larger average baskets in fact their baskets on average are about twice as large as those of non digitally engaged shoppers currently we have more than 15 million digital coupon subscriber accounts and more than 900 million digital coupons were clipped in 2018 our goals in 2019 are to increase our subscriber base and perhaps more importantly the frequency of use we want to make sure that users are engaged with our app more frequently to save time and money this means that we will be launching digital marketing strategies focused on customer acquisition retention and engagement our goal is to use personalization to drive both sales and gross margin benefit over time finally as we continue to test and learn within our digital strategy we plan to pilot buy online pickup in store offering in the second half of fiscal 2019 we are in the early stages of many of these efforts within our digital strategy and we are excited about the potential and the opportunities that lie ahead turning now to non consumable initiative or nci in 2018 we began our test of a bold new and expanded assortment in key non consumable categories of home domestics housewares party and occasion with the amount of space dedicated to non consumables that remains the same we believe this merchandise strategy will drive greater sell through the nci offering was added to approximately 700 stores as of the end of 2018 and we plan to have it in approximately 2 400 stores by the end of 2019 it is important to note that while it is still relatively early we have now worked through multiple replenishment cycles and we like the momentum the reset is generating we are seeing improvements in traffic and sales as well as meaningful improvement in category mix and gross margin within these stores we believe this offering will continue to generate excitement for our customers as it rolls out more broadly today i m excited to introduce two new transformational initiatives that we are rolling out in 2019 the first initiative is one that we call dg fresh the dg fresh initiative is a strategic multi phase shift to self distribution of perishable goods primarily fresh and frozen we believe this initiative will allow us to accomplish three key goals first it will allow us to reduce product costs which can have a meaningful impact on our gross margin in the coming years second it will facilitate higher in stock levels of these goods which should help to drive sales and third it will allow us to control our own destiny in fresh foods most notably by distributing perishables ourselves we can carry more of the fresh products and brands our customers want these include better for you items and national brands today there are many items we cannot cost effectively procure through our current model in addition self distribution will allow us to offer a wider selection of our own private brands to provide our customers with even more compelling value overall we expect dg fresh to allow us to do a better job of tailoring our product selection to fit the needs of our customers particularly in rural areas while our initial focus is on distributing the types of fresh and frozen products we already carry this approach also provides a potential path forward to expanding our produce offering to more of our stores in the future we launched this initiative early in calendar year 2019 and we are currently distributing to approximately 300 stores in the northeast from a new cold storage facility we own in pottsville pennsylvania by the end of this fiscal year our goal is to be serving as many as 5 000 stores from up to four new dg fresh distribution facilities beyond 2019 our goal is to fully implement dg fresh initiative chainwide within three to four years as an annual roll out phase similar to what you see in 2019 as john mentioned the start up cost for dg fresh will be a headwind to sg a this year however we expect this initiative to be meaningfully accretive to sales and operating margin over time the transition to self distribution has been relatively smooth which is a testament to the strong relationships we have with our vendors the support of our distributors and our proven ability to execute complex projects we are excited about the potential for this initiative the second new strategic initiative we re introducing today is fast track fast track is a two pronged approach to increasing labor productivity in our stores enhancing customer convenience and further improving on shelf availability driving our performance higher in these areas will be foundational to our ability to execute on our buy online pickup in store pilot later this year in addition we believe that our success with fast track over the long term can create significant sg a savings the first key component of fast track involves streamlining the stocking process in our stores which we call one touch unloading this new approach is designed to make stocking shelves simpler and faster reducing the amount of labor needed to complete this task it will begin with fundamental changes at the distribution centers where we will make which will make processes even more store friendly with products and deliveries sorted by location within the store our focus is on reducing the amount of time spent stocking the shelves following the truck delivery allowing us to get products on the shelves more quickly we also believe we can reduce the amount of time that our store associates spend restocking shelves in between deliveries the second component of fast track is self checkout option this self checkout will allow customers to scan and pay for their items with little to no assistance needed from our associates dollar general is known for value and convenience and our customers have told us that speed of checkout is vitally important to their in store experience ultimately fast track should help boost on shelf availability and free up labor hours that we can dedicate to other in store priorities such as customer experience our goal is to pilot fast track in several of our distribution centers and select stores during 2019 following the pilot we will determine the best plan for our broader rollout like the dg fresh initiative fast track will also have an upfront cost that will impact sg a at scale however we believe this initiative will be accretive to our sg a profile and well worth the investment these are just a few examples of how we continue to be an innovative leader in our channel we are excited about these long term strategic growth initiatives which are fully aligned with our ongoing commitment to our four operating priorities as you will recall our first operating priority is driving profitable sales growth we have a robust pipeline of initiatives in place to drive growth in 2019 our most impactful merchandising initiative continues to be our cooler door expansion as we head into 2019 this remains a significant opportunity coolers are a great traffic driver and they allow us to offer even more of the products our customers want in fiscal 2019 we plan to install more than 40 000 cooler doors across our store base in 2018 we launched our better for you initiative which introduced healthier food options in more than 2500 stores this offering was in direct response the conversations with our customers who told us they want a healthier options at affordable prices we are pleased with the initial customer reception and the performance of this product set we intend to offer the better for you products in approximately 6 000 stores by the end of 2019 our new good smart private brand has gained traction with our customers and we are positioned as a core product line in better for you in addition to good smart launch in 2018 we had great success with the launch of studio selection our aspirational health and beauty private brand in 2019 we are planning a similar private brand launch in baby products i m also excited to announce that we will be launching a new private brand in cosmetics in april we remain dedicated to the beauty category at dollar general and we believe we can continue to take share from all classes of trade having a premier private brand is an important part of our strategy the new dg private brand will be called believe and we will include an inspiring lineup of attractively priced cosmetics that we think will be appealing to our customers this cosmetic line is just one part of our ongoing efforts to capture share in the health and beauty category from efforts focused on the growing bath body segment to enhancing the shopping experience in this section of the store with more intuitive signing and product placement we have a lot of opportunity to drive hba sales across private brand we continue to believe we can increase sales and penetration which could have a meaningful impact on both gross margin and sales growth over the long term in 2018 we conducted a holistic review of our private brand portfolio and are incorporating what we ve learned into our 2019 go to market plan in addition to sales driving initiatives we continue to pursue opportunities to enhance gross margin in 2019 we intend to roll out electronic article surveillance units to approximately 3 000 stores we expect to complete this rollout by the end of the second quarter bringing the total for the chain to approximately 13 000 beyond this ongoing near term opportunity i d like to give you a brief update on other longer term gross margin opportunities first within distribution and transportation we have continued to execute our strategy to reduce stem miles i am proud to note that our distribution center in longview texas began shipping in january and it is ramping up very quickly and we expect our distribution center in amsterdam new york to begin shipping later this year as of the end of 2018 we successfully expanded our private fleet to approximately 200 tractors up from 80 at the end of 2017 in 2019 we plan to expand our private fleet further while this fleet remains a small piece of our overall transportation needs we believe it continues to provide strategic flexibility finally foreign sourcing remains a long term gross margin opportunity we are specifically focused on diversifying country of origin as well as growing overall foreign sourcing penetration we believe there are many countries around the world where we can source goods at even greater value for our customers our second operating priority is capturing growth opportunities as we enter 2019 our proven high return low risk model for real estate growth is a core strength of the business we have a long standing track record of successfully opening hundreds of stores every year that meet our strict return thresholds the flexibility of our model has allowed us to invest in new formats store growth and a remodel program all with strong returns that contribute significantly to our growth our store format innovation allows us to expand our addressable market opportunity as well this innovation will continue to play a key role in 2019 as we plan to open 975 new stores that serve communities across the country our real estate model continues to focus on five metrics these metrics help us determine that new store growth remains one of the best uses of our capital we continue to see great results with new store sales performing at nearly 100 of pro forma expectations and returns near the high end of our 20 to 22 goal we are proud of our track record for executing successful real estate projects in 2018 we completed a total of 2 065 real estate projects 65 more than we had originally anticipated for fiscal year 2019 we plan to remodel 1 000 mature stores and relocate 100 stores we expect approximately 500 remodels to be in the dollar general traditional plus or dgtp format we also expect to add produce to approximately 200 stores the majority of which will be dgtp remodels as a reminder our traditional remodel stores which have approximately 22 cooler doors deliver a 4 to 5 comp lift on average in year one and dgtp remodels with approximately 34 cooler doors delivers a 10 to 15 comp lift on average in year one dgtps with produce are at the high end of this range over the past two years we have conducted an exhaustive pilot of our dgx stores and during that time we have refined and enhanced the concept we are now confident that we can drive profitability in the smaller box and we plan to open approximately 10 dgx format stores this year dgx stores are about half the size of a traditional dollar general and have a product selection that is tailored to vertical living customers particularly millennials we are excited about these plans for continued growth and innovation in 2019 our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our position as a low cost operator over the years we have established a clear and defined process to control spending this process has served us well and the entire organization has embraced the cost control mindset in our stores we continue to manage expenses through the efforts such as optimizing product assortment reducing operating complexity and reducing product movement within the stores one of the reasons we are so excited about our fast track initiative is that we believe it has potential to be a significant and incremental driver of store level efficiency our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people as we believe they are a competitive advantage our ongoing dialog with our employees is critical and we learn from these conversations to reinforce our position as an employer of choice in 2018 we greatly expanded our benefits to include those that resonate most with our employees including paid parental leave for mothers and fathers adoption assistance and day 1 access to healthcare benefits for store managers we also launched new training programs including a private fleet driver training program for distribution center employees to complement other existing educational benefits such as tuition assistance and college course credit for store manager training and i am very proud to announce that for the eighth consecutive year dollar general was named to training magazine s top 125 training list ranking number 1 overall on this the most recent 2019 list in 2019 we are expanding our benefits to include day 1 eligibility for telehealth benefits for all employees in our organization our part time employees told us they need help assessing affordable healthcare and we believe this will be a valuable benefit we always monitor the wage environment carefully and believe we are well positioned across the organization as illustrated by robust applicant flow at every level our investment in store manager wages and training continued to pay dividends in 2018 and we finished the year with our lowest store manager turnover rate on record we are also doing very well at the store level where we are seeing our time to fill open positions at all time best levels for the company we think our competitive compensation and benefit package is compelling but we believe that the opportunity to build a long term career with a growing retailer is the most important currency we have to attract and retain talent in 2019 we plan to create approximately 8 000 net new jobs this growth creates an environment where employees have opportunities to advance to higher paying and higher responsibility jobs in a relatively short amount of time being an employer of choice is a priority for us and we will continue to seek out opportunities to enhance our employee experience in closing 2018 was a very good year for dollar general the business is in great shape as we enter 2019 and we are excited about the future as john mentioned our long term goal generally remains to deliver double digit adjusted eps growth to do this we need to make smart business decisions that focus both on growing the top line and capturing incremental operating margin where and when we can today i have highlighted how our progress on our initiatives and operating priorities contributed to a great 2018 looking ahead we believe we are making the right long term strategic investments from a position of strength with our business model that leverages our real estate acumen low cost operating experience and our laser focus on delivering value and convenience to our customers we believe that dollar general s business is differentiated from the rest of the retail landscape i believe we have the best team in consumable retail and i hold each person on my senior team accountable for delivering today and planning for tomorrow s growth i am confident that no one on the team will be satisfied with anything less i am proud of the team s innovative approach to retailing the strategic initiatives they have put forth in motion and the financial performance we are driving we continue to be the leader within our channel we believe we operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail and we have confidence that our strategy and execution will allow us to continue to reach our goals finally a heartfelt thanks to each and every one of our more than 135 000 employees for the hard work that they do every day which allows us to fulfill our mission of serving others with that operator i d now like to open the lines for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question will come from vincent sinisi with morgan stanley please go ahead todd vasos chief executive officer good morning vincent j sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions so just wanted to go of course to the incremental investments on the initiatives this year with obviously still early stages around fresh and whatnot can you just give us a little bit more of a sense for that 50 million specifically like how much at least directionally of maybe a lift to the comps do you think that could provide earlier on and then how much of that maybe recurring as you ramp some of these initiatives going forward i guess you know obviously everyone kind of on the line today is just saying new kind of ok a bit below the double digit growth algorithm for this year but when can that maybe return if that s of course helpful context john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer okay couple of questions there i ll start with the first one around the initiatives as you look at the initiatives as we said we see these as being accretive as early as next year the two new ones we talked about are fast track and fresh we re very excited about both as you look at fresh we see both of them helping the top line and the bottom line as you look at fresh the immediate impact we see from that is helping our gross margin helping reduce our product cost now that does come with upfront expenses particularly in sg a and there is a trade off for sg a for gross margin but we re very excited about what that can do not only to our costs but then also our flexibility and longer term what that could mean in terms of as we expand our fresh offerings and in stock availability there we think that can be a meaningful sales driver on fast track that has two parts to that you have the self checkout piece and then you have the one touch shelf stocking piece the latter will have the more immediate impact and we re starting to do that now and we will scale that over the course of the year the self checkout will take a little bit more time with the technology involved in driving the adoption on that so these are sizable investments this year they ll pressure the sg a but as we look out we see them as being accretive as early as next year having a meaningful impact on our overall operating margin eps growth and really positioning us with the long term in mind to drive double digit eps growth over the long term vincent j sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay all right perfect that s helpful and then if i could last quarter you guys had mentioned and we ve been getting quite a bit of questions around it just kind of your internal surveys the confidence was looking a little bit shaky potentially for kind of later this year but it was nice to see of course in the release today that ticket and traffic were both positive so any updates there any work any thoughts around what you re seeing the basket around the health that would be great todd vasos chief executive officer yeah vinny i would tell you we talk to our core customer each and every quarter and while she is feeling better about having a little bit more money in her pocket she continues to tell us that it is definitely from productivity meaning working more hours and in some cases multiple jobs but what she is also telling us is that she is feeling a little less confident than she was at the middle of last year to the end of last year which gives us a little bit of pause from the standpoint that we think that our core customers starting to weaken a little bit which obviously we do very well in all economic cycles so we re positioning ourselves for the back half of the year for a little weaker consumer as we move through the year vincent j sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay all right that s helpful thank you guys good luck operator the next question is from matthew boss with jpmorgan please go ahead matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great thanks so maybe can you speak to the proactive promotional actions that you took in the fourth quarter any higher level changes in the competitive landscape that drove the change and just how best to think about markdowns and gross margin in 2019 todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i ll start and then turn it over to john for 2019 we really went after some targeted markdowns in q4 as you know q4 has the highest traffic counts across retail not only at dollar general and we ve got a track record here of working the price levers pretty well and we know which ones to work for the stickiness of the customer meaning we pulled some promotional levers in the fourth quarter that we believe will sustain that traffic growth in the q1 without having to be nearly as aggressive and we saw we went added from a position of strength and we saw real opportunity to take share as we went through q4 it did exactly what we thought it would do and positions us very well going into the first quarter here in 2019 john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer and as todd said with this helping drive traffic and taking share in our belief that we can retain these customers we believe we re very well positioned going into 2019 to further optimize our promotional activity while at the same time driving profitable sales and traffic so we feel we re very well positioned matthew boss jpmorgan analyst great and then just a follow up on same store sales so how best to think about the cadence this year relative to the 2 5 for the year it sounds like we should anticipate the first half better than the back half just given what you ve seen in your surveys but have you seen the momentum continue in the first quarter despite tax refunds and some pressures that others have cited todd vasos chief executive officer yeah i d start by saying the fundamentals are very strong we re really pleased with the impact that our initiatives are having and the share we are taking there is a bit of a timing impact to start the year we talked about the benefit from the acceleration of snap payments from early q1 into late q4 that did have a bit of an impact on the beginning of the quarter not necessarily dollar for dollar but i would draw that timing to your attention other than that it s a pretty smooth year in our minds and everything is firing on all cylinders matthew boss jpmorgan analyst that s great best of luck todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from rupesh parikh with oppenheimer please go ahead todd vasos chief executive officer good morning rupesh rupesh parikh oppenheimer company analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just going back to your commentary in the press release about generally double digit eps growth going forward is that more of a reflection this year is going to be below 10 then you expect to get back to potentially next year and beyond or is there something that changes your confidence in that metric todd vasos chief executive officer no the comment we made there and i ll start by saying we continue to see ourselves as double digit eps growers over the long term that comment just meant to say that we reserve the right in some years to make targeted investments to drive that long term growth and protect the 10 growth rupesh parikh oppenheimer company analyst great and then just on gross margins i appreciate the color that you provided on q1 so it sounds like we should expect as comparisons get easier that decline versus what we see in q1 to progressively get better as the year progresses is that the right way you guys are thinking about the cadence john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think you re thinking about that s the right way we ve talked about a couple of pressures at the beginning of the year one of the things we talked about is changes to inventory replenishment we ve seen a very high correlation between on shelf availability and sales and as such we re making an investment at the beginning of the year bringing more inventory and to make sure we re right in stock this will have a q1 price tag due to the impact on product mix but as we cycle through that that ll normalize the other thing is as the year progresses we expect to start to see some benefits from the initiatives we re putting in place like fresh and others to enhance gross margin so as you look at the year on a year over year comparison we expect that to improve as the year progresses rupesh parikh oppenheimer company analyst great thank you operator the next question is from michael lasser with ubs todd vasos chief executive officer good morning michael lasser ubs analyst thanks a lot good morning todd thanks a lot for taking my question so if you re successful with some of the initiatives that you re rolling out this year should we expect you to accelerate the rollout of them next year since the 2020 would be another year of sub 10 eps growth todd vasos chief executive officer michael thanks for the question as you know here at dollar general we do everything very methodically and we make sure that it has a solid return before we move to a broad scale roll out in saying that we really like what we see from dg fresh early on and we have great confidence in our fast track momentum as well especially around some of the digital efforts of that we have to include the self checkout option that will be coming in saying that as john indicated we believe that these initiatives will become accretive as we move into next year so should help offset some of those pressures as we continue a broader scale rollout a little bit of a pay as you go if you will type of a rollout schedule michael lasser ubs analyst so just to clarify you re looking at 2019 as more of a transitional year returning to the algorithm over the longer run next year john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer there is as we indicated there is start up cost associated with this and as we start to scale these as todd said it s more as a pay for itself as it goes and we expect these to be accretive as early as 2020 michael lasser ubs analyst okay and then could you break down the gross margin from the fourth quarter in a bit more detail you outlined the promotion what piece of the gross margin drag was that and then initial markups are now a drag on gross margin how did that work john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah walking through last year we articulated the specific q4 drivers but i guess stepping back and taking a broader look if you look at the full year our gross margin was down 32 basis points but we are very pleased with the results where we drove traffic we took share delivered very good comps we did invest the margin in opportunistically in promotional activity as todd mentioned but is clearly resonated with our customers allowed us to take share that was a very high take rate here and help us deliver the sales and we believe that this will stick and we ll be in a position next year to rationalize these investments the other impact with snap while that did benefit our sales with that pull forward there was a mix impact that came with in general lower mix of those additional sales and then the team managed through the headwinds of tariffs in transportation costs as we go into this year as we said we believe we re very well positioned that we can throttle back be even more targeted on our promotional activity while still driving traffic and sales we believe we have opportunities to increase margin over time with the new initiatives like dg fresh and the nci initiative shrink where we ve had nine quarters of year over year improvement and the other levers that we ve talked about we think we re very well positioned michael lasser ubs analyst okay thank you very much and good luck with the year todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from peter keith with piper jaffray please go ahead peter keith piper jaffray analyst hi thanks good morning everyone i wanted to dig into the comp that you re getting from new stores and from remodels historically that s been in a range of 1 5 to 2 but it s interesting with dgtp acceleration and some of the fresh initiatives seems like there s an accelerated lift i m curious if you re starting to move to the high end of that 1 5 to 2 range or are you potentially above it sort of a structural impact to your comp todd vasos chief executive officer thanks for the question i would tell you that we re very happy with not only our new store pipeline but our remodel relocation pipelines as well and i think you re thinking of it right in that because of the ramp up of our remodels especially in the dgtp format to include produce in many of those stores we re closer to the high end i wouldn t say that we have broken out of that the range that we talk about but we re more at the high end of that range with some of the work that we ve done peter keith piper jaffray analyst okay thank you i did want to dig into a little bit on how you re talking about the accretion benefits in 2020 from the growth initiatives i guess in reality when we look back at the last three years the guidance for 2018 you really haven t been at 10 earnings growth in any of the years if you exclude the tax changes so are you seeing that do you think you will be at 10 plus by 2020 and that these are all initiatives as a whole will be accretive to next year john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i ll just reiterate that over the long term we see ourselves as double digit eps growers we re not giving specific guidance in 2020 at this point but we do feel very good about the initiatives and their ability to be accretive next year as you look at the fundamentals of the business model we feel very good about what we re seeing from our new store growth with the great returns and the sales from those with what we re seeing on a comp basis with the performance of the initiatives and the comps we are seeing we see as we said a lot of opportunities over the long term to improve our operating margin we really look at operating margin overall and we believe we re making the right investments here to enhance that operating margin it comes at a little bit of a cost now but we believe this positions us better for the future we continue to generate a tremendous amount of cash which allows us to reinvest in these business while paying back significant amount to shareholders through share repurchases so we don t see the future differently peter keith piper jaffray analyst okay thank you very much and good luck todd vasos chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from ed kelly with wells fargo please go ahead edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst hi guys good morning todd vasos chief executive officer good morning edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst i just want to start going with clarification when you talked about the impact of snap in february not having the same dollar for dollar impact are you saying that the headwind in february was not as big as the benefit that you saw in january todd vasos chief executive officer that s exactly what we re saying we have not seen a dollar for dollar impact i think that really goes to what i talked about earlier some of those investments we made in markdown being very sticky and we know our customer very well and when you get to change her shopping patterns she sticks with that and we saw that as we moved into q1 edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst and then just curious as to i know you only have a couple of weeks but how march has looked given that things kind of normalize there refund seems to be picking up and then just one other question about all this did you mention that there were some conservatism built into the comp guidance around the back half of the year i m not sure if i heard that right todd vasos chief executive officer i ll take the first one but we really aren t talking really much about q1 right now obviously but i would frame it this way we feel very confident in our top line sales due to all of the initiatives that we have in play including the investment we made in q4 and just keep in mind march has an easter shift in it i think that s important toward the end of the month but for us we ll equalize as we move through april so we re bullish about the quarter but we have a lot of quarter left to go and john you may want to address the other one john w garratt executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah other than the timing impact we mentioned the overall year comp we guided to reflect our current view of the year edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst okay and then todd just one quick follow up for you on dg fresh why now on this on self distribution and can you just help us understand the benefits like what type of margin opportunity is here from doing this yourself like why does in stocks improve with more frequent deliveries and why don t you tell us about your plans for fresh todd vasos chief executive officer yeah so why now i think the best way to answer that is that we continue to expand our cooler program here it s been one of the biggest traffic drivers and one of our biggest comp drivers that we ve seen we have a series of distributors out there today across the country and those distributors do a nice job for us but it comes at a cost and that cost is very high as you can imagine in many cases a full service program so we see a real opportunity from a position of strength right now to take that in house and control your own destiny and the way we see sales and margin enhancements here is a couple of ways number one on margin not having to pay that very hefty up charge we re going to build a bank the majority of that with a little labor that we re putting in the stores to help work the goods again coming off of the full service program but margins will be very accretive with this program and then the second thing is sales what you re going to see is our ability one to stay in stock number two longer term what you re going to find from us as i mentioned in my prepared remarks is going to be a different assortment that s going to really take into account a lot of our private brand offerings which will help our margins and our sales but also on items that we don t carry today because of the distributor network that we have so we re very excited about this this is probably one of the biggest margin opportunities we will have shorter term to really move the needle here edward kelly wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator the next question will come from scot ciccarelli with rbc capital markets please go ahead scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst hi guys i guess i m still little confused on some of the markdown commentary so i know you guys have talked about the pricing environment being pretty benign and you re comfortable with where your pricing is so can you help us understand little bit better why you engaged in that promotional activity that you did number one number two how does it benefit 1q even as you pull back promotions i guess i m a little confused on that thanks todd vasos chief executive officer yes sure so as the way we look at customer and customer traffic again as i mentioned we talk to our customer every quarter what she was telling us is that she was feeling a little weaker than she was middle of the year and we took an opportunity from a position of strength to take share we saw where we could take share in many different dmas across the country and we thought the best way to do that which turned out to work pretty nicely was to do it on a promotional basis because we feel very confident in our everyday shelf pricing that we have today and so we did it on a promotional basis and we know this customer very well we know if we can change her shopping patterns especially in the busy fourth quarter when we have her attention it is she s very sticky she ll stay with us and i think we ve seen some of that as we entered q1 evidenced by the not for dollar to dollar trade off back on snap as an example so we believe that it did exactly what we thought and we ve said in the past we reserve the right to go in and make these investments periodically to continue to drive traffic and continue to take share and that s exactly what we did in q4 scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst got it that s helpful and then just curious was traffic positive kind of throughout the quarter todd vasos chief executive officer yeah it was pretty stable throughout the quarter at the back half a little stronger than the first but i would tell you we re pleased overall with the traffic in q4 scot ciccarelli rbc capital markets analyst great thanks a lot guys operator the final question will come from robbie ohmes with bank of america please go ahead robert ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey thanks for taking my question todd i was just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the long term profit outlook of dg fresh so can you just sort of create a picture for us if you do roll this out over the next three to four years how does the income statement change are you expecting a sort of a secularly higher gross margin and kind of permanently higher expense ratio and what are the kind of long term assumptions about what store sales productivity levels have to be to make this all work on a large scale basis and you ve mentioned some how you re taking more of your distribution in house a little bit i mean does that have to accelerate more significantly to support being doing fresh on a very large scale basis maybe just help us understand that the 4 the three year to five year outlook for how much this could change your entire store base it s probably more complicated to operate this category as well thanks todd vasos chief executive officer yeah that s a great question and i would first start by saying that as we look at the dg fresh initiative we see a real opportunity to drive both the top line and the margin so i would look at it this way it will be a significant margin driver as we move into 2020 and beyond and that s really driven primarily off of the distributor cost that we pay today which has a substantial up charge attached to it substantial and as we work with our vendors which we ve got relationships with all of them what we re finding in the first 300 stores in first dc that we put in were substantial reductions in cost of goods to move the product into our own dcs and distribute it ourselves so i think you need to look at it that way on the top line i think it ll be a meaningful top line contributor as well as we continue to be better in stock because we can we know how to distribute goods fresh shelf stable whatever it may be controlling our own destiny there gives us high confidence that we can execute at a much higher level than we were seeing across the country we had some distribution voids quite frankly across the country and we still do with our distributor network because it is so complex and so large by taking it in house we believe it will simplify our network and be able to execute that much better and as you continue to look out we see opening these dcs about the same pace as 2019 so an average of 5 000 to 6 000 stores a year for the foreseeable future until we re built out and we believe that these fresh distribution centers there we will be able to leverage as well some of our dry goods that perhaps we can deliver out of there as well taking some of the pressure off of our larger dcs so we believe it s a win win across the board which should see substantial p l ramifications on a positive side as we move into 2020 and then beyond robert ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst terrific best of luck thanks todd vasos chief executive officer thanks you operator ladies and gentlemen we

results of diana shipping inc for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 our performance strengthened significantly during the recent quarter and year as reflected in higher time charter revenues and the dramatic turnaround in profitability this is the result of the patient and focused strategy we have persistently followed over many years which position the company to take advantage of improving industry conditions in addition we took steps to fortify our balance sheet in 2018 while also demonstrating our strong belief in the company by conducting a self tender offer lastly we have continued to actively manage our fleet profile to optimize our mix of vessels and maintain our operational and financial flexibility to summarize our financial results diana shipping inc reported net income of 2 9 million and net income attributed to common stockholders of 1 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 this represents a turnaround from a net loss of 436 9 million and a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 438 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 which included a 422 5 million impairment loss for the full year 2018 net income was 16 6 million and net income attributed to common stockholders was 10 8 this was a significant improvement compared with the net loss of 511 7 million and a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 517 5 million including the impairment loss for 2017 time charter revenues rose to 62 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 from 48 9 million for the same quarter of 2017 mainly due to the increased average time charter rates that we have achieved for our vessels time charter revenues were 226 2 million for the full year of 2018 up from 161 9 million for 2017 turning to the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled a healthy 151 4 million at december 31 2018 long term debt net of deferred financing cost including the current portion was 530 5 million compared to stockholders equity of more than 627 7 million the company enhanced its financial flexibility during the 2018 fourth quarter by redeeming all of the outstanding 8 5 senior notes due 2020 at the aggregate principal amount of approximately 63 25 million this was made possible in part by our issuance during the third quarter of 100 million private placement of senior unsecured bonds maturing in september 2023 reflecting our commitment to return value to shareholders at the end of december 2018 the company completed the self tender offer to purchase up to 4 166 666 shares of our outstanding common stock at a price of 3 6 per share the board of directors determined that repurchasing the shares was in the company s best interest given our cash position and stock price in connection with our active management of the company s fleet in the 2018 fourth quarter we agreed to sell two vessels the alcyon for a sale price of 7 45 million before commissions and the triton for a sale price of 7 35 million before commissions in early 2019 we announced agreements to sell the vessels naias and dione at a sale price of 7 2 million each all four of these vessels were 2001 built and were among the oldest vessels in fleet we will continue to manage our fleet in a responsible manner that promotes a balance of time charter maturities and produces a predictable revenue stream as we look ahead in 2019 we will continue the prudent management of our financial position and our fleet and we ll maintain our focus on delivering value to our shareholders with that i ll now turn the call over to our president anastasios margaronis for a perspective on industry conditions he will then be followed by our chief financial officer andreas michalopoulos who will provide a more detailed financial overview thank you anastasios c margaronis president thank you simon and welcome to all the participants of this quarterly conference call of diana shipping inc last year started off on a very positive note in the bulk area market but things began to deteriorate and the market lost its gains and more toward the end of the year proof of this is baltic dry index which started the year at 1 282 and stood at only 637 on february 25 the baltic cape index moved from 1 987 to 520 over the same period and the baltic panamax index stood at 1 391 on january 2 closing yesterday at only 608 since mid october last year panamax rates are down by 52 while capesize rates are also down 32 over the same period let s start with macroeconomic developments which usually have a role to play in the medium to long term fortunes of the shipping industry in the eurozone the economy grew 1 8 in 2018 the imf predicts growth will slow down to a maximum of 1 6 this year with downside risks present in 2018 the chinese economy grew by 6 6 that was the slowest pace since 1990 but the comparison becomes rather meaningless if you look back in the context of the overall size of the chinese economy in 2018 and in 1990 for 2019 growth is expected to come in at 6 2 developing economies on the other hand grew at a brisk 4 6 in 2018 the imf expects growth to slow down to about 4 5 this year overall world gdp growth in 2018 was 3 7 and this rate of growth is expected to come down to 3 5 this year starting with steel now looking at commodities according to howe robinson chinese steel production rose nearly 10 in 2018 on the back of strong expansion in real estate and ongoing government infrastructure project howe robinson expects chinese steel production to fall in 2019 however they cite state sponsored projects such as the recently announced 125 billion rail network expansion to limit the extent of any decline steel stock piles in china at the end of december were approximately 9 2 million ton which was about 100 000 tonnes less than at the same time in 2017 turning to demand now for shipping overall according to clarksons total bulk carrier trade in 2018 reached the 29 339 trillion ton miles an increase of 2 8 compared to 2017 in 2019 they estimate that volumes will increase by 3 4 to reach 30 343 trillion ton miles in 2021 volumes are estimated to increase by 2 8 ph looking at iron ore now according to clarksons global seaborne iron ore trade is estimated to have contracted marginally to 1 47 billion tonnes in 2018 largely reflecting weaker shipments to china this was mainly caused by more scrap use in the countries of steel industry and a drawdown in port inventories in 2019 chinese iron ore imports are expected to increase by around 2 as the sharp drawdown in inventories seen last year is not expected to be repeated and the consumption of scrapping china s blast furnaces might fall back from the level seen last year the latter could be caused through the arrival of more high quality steel in the markets according to banchero costa the outlook for chinese iron ore imports in 2019 remains worried as higher iron ore prices and lower steel prices have cut into steel mill profit margins discouraging the steel mills from ramping up output and restocking raw materials according to clarksons following the disaster caused by the collapse over vale s corrego do feijao dam vale announced that 40 million tonnes per annum of iron ore production will be suspended to allow for the decommissioning of 10 000 dams over the next three years as a result overall brazilian iron ore shipments could be between 5 million tonnes and 50 ph million tonnes per year weaker than earlier projections this would amount to about 1 of seaborne iron ore trade or 0 3 ph of total annual bulk trade the interesting question is to try and determine where the shortfall in projected iron ore shipments might come from and what effect that would have on the overall ton mile demand for capes it is quite certain though that business for the vale sized bulkers would be negatively affected as a result of this disaster we need to keep in mind that these ships cannot be employed in any other routes but those envisaged by vale when they were design built as for coking coal now holding against to clarksons total world imports of coking coal could reach 275 million tonnes this year an increase of 3 compared to 2018 in 2020 the estimate is set at 282 million tonnes which would be a further increase of 2 inaudible chinese import demand and potentially weaker prices represent downside risks so do european union seaborne coking coal imports which are expected to show only marginal growth in the coming years thermal coal according to clarksons thermal coal imports are estimated to increase by 2 this year and reach 996 million tonnes and about 1 growth in 2020 this year china is expected to remain the world s largest seaborne steam coal importer although volumes are expected to fall slightly year on year when significant downside risks are present as mentioned below according to howe robinson the chinese government imposed restrictions on thermal coal imports from mid november onwards according to banchero costa india continues to have strong coal imports as domestic production shortfalls domestic logistics bottlenecks regulations targeting pollution cuts and surging demand for power from household electrification lead to higher imports from suppliers in indonesia south africa and the united states on top of all the above according to comodo research at the beginning of february china s six major coastal power plants had 14 7 million tonnes of coal in stock pile which was 50 higher than a year ago turning to grain cargos in the 2018 2019 grain season clarksons expected the grain imports to reach 500 million metric tonnes which if it materializes will be an increase of 4 in 2019 2020 the expectation is for a further increase of 3 to 515 million metric tonnes according to banchero costa global soybean trade is expected to contract by 0 7 in 2018 to 2019 grain mainly as lower chinese imports due to us trade tensions outweigh an increase in european imports turning to the supply now of tonnage newbuilding deliveries last year were 27 3 million deadweight compared with 37 1 million deadweight in 2017 this year newbuilding deliveries are expected to reach 37 million to 38 million deadweight comodo research are concerned by the fact that while in 2018 about 297 vessels were delivered this year the number is expected to be in the 330 to 430 range unless demolitions increase so as to compensate for this extra newbuilding tonnage supply might become an issue for the dry bulk market by increasing well over 3 which is currently anticipate by most analysts clarksons estimate fleet growth of 3 this year with fundamental looking fairly balanced with downside demand risks as mentioned already banchero costa also expects fleet growth of 3 for this year assuming demolition activity increases from its record low level seen in 2018 in line with expected increases in newbuilding deliveries this year clarksons believe that supply growth could be limited by the impact of the january 2020 global sulphur cap with bulk carriers out of commission to fit scrubbers absorbing about 0 5 of bulk fleet capacity across 2019 scrapping last year s demolition volumes of 4 million deadweight were the lowest seen for 10 years in 2017 13 6 million deadweight worth of capacity was scrapped in 2019 banchero costa expect the scrapping to reach at least 10 million deadweight tonne with scrapping slowing down significantly in 2018 to just over 4 million deadweight tonne the average age of the bulk carrier fleet went up from 9 1 years at the end of 2017 to 9 6 years last december a quick look at the order book now according to clarksons at the end of last year there were 88 5 million deadweight tons worth of ships on order representing 11 of the bulk carrier fleet the capesize order book was 49 9 million deadweight tons which was 15 of the existing fleet and 20 9 million deadweight tons of panamax s were on order the equivalent of 10 of the existing fleet nearly half of this newbuilding tonnage is scheduled for delivery this year while the rest will be delivered in 2020 and beyond so what kind of an outlook do analysts provide us with all these data comodo research are rather bearish on the prospects of the world economy and for the dry bulk market as a whole they point out that the vale incident is a new headwind for the capesize market that will require continued evaluation the positive news they cite in this sector is the arrest of an elderly vloc conversion this might reveal problems known in some circles for a while now about the structural integrity of these ships it is possible that the further trading of these vessels might be suspended if the supply and demand forecast described earlier unmaterialize this year rates should improve from their present depressed levels on the other hand clarksons report that while overall demand supply outlook for the bulk carrier sector in 2019 looks broadly balanced a number of significant downside risks to the demand side are clear these range from global economic concerns to uncertainty over the outlook of china s coal and iron ore imports clarksons counter balanced these negative factors by pointing out that increased demolition and vessel of higher time for scrubber retrofits mentioned earlier could have a positive impact on this note we will pass the call over to our cfo andreas michalopoulos who will provide us with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter of last year and for 2018 as a whole thank you andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer thank you stasi and good morning i am pleased to be discussing today with you diana s operational results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 net income and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to 2 9 million and 1 5 million respectively earnings per common share were 0 01 time charter revenues increased to 62 9 million compared to 48 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was due to the increased average time charter rates that we achieved for our vessels during the quarter this increase was partly offset by a decreasing revenues due to the sale of the vessels alcyon and triton in december 2018 ownership days were 4 554 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 4 624 in the same quarter of 2017 fleet utilization was 99 1 compared to 98 9 for the same quarter of 2017 and the daily time charter equivalent rate was 13 527 compared to 9 949 for the same quarter of 2017 voyage expenses were 2 7 million for the quarter compared to 3 million for the same quarter of 2017 and the decrease in voyage expenses was due to a gain from bunkers of 0 7 million compared to a loss of 0 5 million in the same quarter of 2017 vessel operating expenses amounted to 25 2 million compared to 24 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased by 5 the increase was due to increasing insurances repairs and maintenance costs of the vessels and taxes daily operating expenses were 5 536 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 5 195 for the same quarter of 2017 representing an increase of 7 depreciation and amortization of deferred charges amounted to 13 million general and administrative expenses were 9 million compared to 8 2 million for the same quarter last year the increase was mainly due to increased payroll and training costs and the exchange rate of euro to us dollars management fees to related party were 0 6 million compared to 0 5 million last year due to the increased average number of vessels managed by diana wilhelmsen interest and finance costs amounted to 9 million compared to 6 8 million in the same quarter of 2017 this increase was attributable to increased average interest rates in the quarter compared to the same quarter of 2017 and was partly offset by decreased average debt interest and other income amounted to 0 8 million compared to 1 5 million for the same quarter last year the decrease was due to the repayment of the loan due from diana containerships for the year now ended december 31 2018 net income amounted to 16 6 million and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to 10 8 million earnings per share was 0 10 time charter revenues increased to 226 2 million compared to 161 9 million for 2017 the increase was attributable to increased average time charter rates that we achieved through our vessels during the year less a five ph days compared to 2017 ownership days in 2018 were 18 204 compared to 18 119 fleet utilization was 99 1 compared to 98 2 in 2017 and the daily time charter equivalent rate was 12 179 compared to 8 568 in 2017 voyage expenses were 7 4 million in 2018 vessel operating expenses amounted to 95 5 million compared to 90 4 million in 2017 the increase in operating expenses was due to increased insurances repairs and maintenance costs and taxes daily operating expenses in 2018 were 5 247 compared to 4 987 for 2017 representing a 5 increase depreciation and amortization of deferred charges amounted to 52 2 million in 2018 general and administrative expenses increased to 29 5 million compared to 26 3 million in 2017 mainly due to increased payroll and training costs increased bod fees and legal fees and the exchange rate of fuel to us dollars management fee to related party was 2 4 million compared to 1 9 million in 2017 the increase was due to an increased average number of vessels managed by diana wilhelmsen during the year compared to 2017 interest and finance costs amounted to 30 5 million compared to 26 6 million in 2017 this increase was attributable to increased average interest rates compared to last year while average debt is decreasing interest and other income amounted to 8 8 million compared to 4 5 million in 2017 this increase was mainly due to the payment of the 5 million discount price which was recorded in income on the date of the loan repayment by diana containerships inc thank you for your attention we would now be pleased to respond to your question and i will turn the call to the operator who will instruct you as to the procedure for asking questions operator thank you sir at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from noah parquette with jpmorgan please state your question noah parquette j p morgan analyst great thanks i just wanted to ask you guys wanted to ask about use of cash flow obviously the tender in q4 that was one drive off because that was kind of pre the vale news and the market moved lower i mean how are you in terms of your comfortable like a liquidity buffer at this point given where rates are i mean would you consider more moves like the tender or taking up the deferred stock or are you kind of want to see a little bit extra liquidity out there ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary no this is ioannis zafirakis speaking we are considering the cash position that we have today to be sufficient on the conservative side of the business i have to say as we were trying to explain earlier we feel that the fare meter is on the high side and there is some justification for being afraid for the demand and certainly there is the thought of the demand going down but we also believe that these may have been a little bit overestimated which has led also supply to be on the low side lower than what should have been and the net effect most probably is going to be much more positive than everybody thinks having said that to answer your question directly we think that the liquidity the cash that we have aside is more than enough and don t forget that we are selling also vessels and therefore a tender offer is not out of the question noah parquette j p morgan analyst okay that s clear and then i just wanted to ask about the 2001 built ships that you re selling one you still have i think one more it s safe to assume that s up on the block too are those just trying to get a sense of or two more are those going to scrap or are those going to trade just to get a sense how scrapping will shape up this year ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary no no those vessels are fully tradable they ve been sold to before the trading andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer the scrap value of those vessels is almost half of what they have been sold for noah parquette j p morgan analyst yes okay great thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from randy giveans with jefferies please state your question randy giveans jefferies analyst yes so two quick questions for me so diana obviously been very active in the time charter market in recent months and it was kind of continuous but is that specifically due to kind of a weaker outlook for short term spot rates or just an ongoing strategic decision to kind of keep rechartering vessels to maintain 75 80 time charter coverage for the next six months to nine months ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary you are closer to the second explanation as we have done since 2005 we keep our strategy the same chartering of our vessels is staggering process we will continue doing that i m not that 100 certain whether it is 70 or 80 that you mentioned it is absolutely correct we don t have such a target in our mind what we have as a target is to have a vessel opening every 15 days or 20 days we are trying our best not to have a lot of vessels opening at the same time and this is what we will continue doing randy giveans jefferies analyst sure okay and then looking at the balance sheet now on kind of where it is currently after some refinancings and whatnot can you provide a quarterly debt amor for this year and maybe for 2020 any big balloons in the near term anastasios c margaronis president yes so as we had stated we had a loan for motor vessel maera which had a balloon and a maturity amount of 12 1 million and that was maturing on the 4th of january this was repaid this loan was repaid and we have the vessel now that is without a mortgage so this was a conscious decision within our strategy to slightly de lever the company we decided to repay that vessel considering motor vessel crystalia and atalandi those two vessels we had a maturing installment a maturing balloon and installment of 21 million that we also repaid a few days ago it was maturing a few days ago on that amount we are nearly concluded to refinance those two vessels as soon as we refinance them you will be the first to know but we are in final stages of refinancing those two vessels for about 19 million for both and finally within our maturities you have a loan for ismene and selina with the maturity amount of around 20 million maturing on the 30th of june we intend to also refinance those two vessels at maturity and this should be absolutely no problem for us to do that last but not least motor vessel houston is maturing at the end of the year with a balloon installment of 4 9 million on the november 19th we have not decided yet what we re going to do at that point in time of the year with that amount what is important for you to know is that we have banks that are there to refinance our vessels and that s point number one and point number two is that we do not want as ioannis said i think at the beginning of the call to diminish our cash balance in the balance sheet we are at the point in the cycle where we are building the balance sheet and the cash in the balance sheet and we intend to do that randy giveans jefferies analyst got it and in kind of just for total debt amor for this year and next year not necessarily including the vessel sales just kind of scheduled debt amor anastasios c margaronis president you will see all that in the 20 f but basically for this year is around 100 million all inclusive and for next year it s about 40 million and a lot in the half for the next six years but i think in a few days you will have the 20 f filing that we will do and you will have all that in greater detail which is most important for you at that time randy giveans jefferies analyst yes excellent and then i guess one quick housekeeping question so yeah congrats on that tender offer now following those share repurchases what is the current share count that we should use for 2019 ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary you want the exact number it s 103 million shares something you want the exact number andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer 103 764 351 randy giveans jefferies analyst 103 764 351 now we re talking all right thanks again gentlemen have it going operator thank you operator instructions ladies and gentlemen there appears to be no additional requests for questions i ll turn it back to management for closing remarks thank you simeon p palios chairman and chief executive officer thank you again for your interest

growing wider still ratings decisions after the close of markets on friday may well add to that picture first there s italy its economy is in recession and growth forecasts have been slashed by economists in recent months commerzbank reckons that moody s which rates italy baa3 with a stable outlook could shift that view to negative raising the risk of a downgrade in the months ahead not

prospects say analysts the contrasting fortunes are evident in stocks too over the past year the milan bourse has underperformed the euro zone index by 5 percent while lisbon is off just 0 6 percent for sure the prospect of lower rates for longer and more cheap ecb loans for banks has boosted stock and bond markets across the periphery but the divergence in southern european markets which began after italy s political crisis in may last year looks set to continue below you can see the diverging fortunes of the two countries stock and bond markets over the past year dhara ranasinghe and josephine mason reading the charts 1345 gmt as investors wonder how much longer the global equity rally can last chartists are pointing to some bullish technical signals on european bourses that may help stocks grind even higher the euro zone stoxxe pierced its 300 dma and london s ftse 100 hit its 200 day moving average this morning the latest sign the market s upward momentum is building the first significantly bullish sign for the ftse 100 was on jan 30 when the 20 day ma pierced the 50 day says mike van dulken head of research at accendo markets the third a most significant would be if the 50 day ma breaches the 200 day ma with the short term trend crossing the long term one and forming a bullish golden cross chart it may take another couple of weeks of gains for the ftse to get there and fundamentals from brexit news to economic data could derail all that but if it does it d be a major breakout from recent ranges and potentially point to another leg higher josephine mason canary in the u s earnings mine 1220 gmt while investors shovel money with enthusiasm at u s stocks profit margins are painting a different picture analysing profit margins derived from national economic accounts nipa u s corporate margins don t look as strong once favourable tax treatments and economic cycles are accounted for according to blackrock investment institute strategists story continues they say that a global earnings recession is very likely in 2019 as u s corporate margins have likely peaked earnings are a key driver for equity returns over the long term data from u s national accounts is a better indicator as profit margins tend to lead benchmark stock index margins such as those of the s p 500 and turning points in nipa margins precede those of the s p by an average three quarters saikat chatterjee is it good to be passive 1141 gmt should one be active or passive a new report suggests passive investing on a roll in recent years will overtake its older better established cousin in the united states by 2021 the report by moody s says its data showed record outflows from u s active funds last year active investment strategies share of the total declined to 63 3 percent from 75 percent in 2013 the share of passive investment on the other hand has risen steadily and is set to exceed 50 percent by 2021 moody s projects versus an estimated 36 7 percent last year the boom is global fundamentally it s driven by the belief that index tracking vehicles such as etfs are more efficient at channelling corporate earnings into investors pockets as they cut out hefty fees and commissions to fund managers and traders but there are other drivers too for one there is growing concentration in the active industry as more money migrates to a small pool of superior managers second there s a trend towards even lower fee passive products fidelity for instance has launched a suite of zero fee etfs moody s notes passive is gaining ground in europe too passive funds assets will rise to 25 percent by 2025 from 14 5 percent at end 2018 moody s predicts here the eu s mifid 2 rules are helping as these provide better visibility into the fees that active funds are charging these changes will likely push retail investors toward cheaper passive funds including etfs just as they become more widely available through investment online platforms moody s concludes whether the passive strategy pays off in these turbulent times with wild intraday swings in indices and stock prices in recent months remains to be seen sujata rao tgif and no brexit vote today 1131 gmt a deal no deal a delay this roughly summarises the chaotic week in the british parliament and today some comfort that the chances of avoiding a no deal brexit are rising and perhaps a little relief there s no complex brexit related vote this evening to contend with the market s certainly in a risk on mood the relief along with hopes about a u s china trade truce appear to

slowing economic growth and the fact there hasn t been much more than rhetoric around the u s china trade talks says deputy chief investment officer edward park at asset manager brooks macdonald he says it s still difficult to get too excited about euro zone and uk equities given all the headwinds there are still quite a lot of moving parts to brexit there will only be limited respite or buying

in addition to the political and economic implosion of venezuela under threat of imperialist intervention by the united states and in the context of the geopolitical conflict between the us and russia and china other nations in south america including chile brazil ecuador and argentina face deep economic recessions instability and an explosion of struggles by the working class on march 6 argentine teachers launched a three day strike postponing the beginning of the school year the strike was widely observed across the country the main issue in the walkout was a demand for a wage increase to make up for past inflation the buying power of teachers wages is being demolished every day by an inflation rate that is near 50 percent the teachers are demanding a national monthly wage of 26 000 pesos us630 according to the marine vilte institute an education think tank while teachers average starting salary is us309 a month a typical argentine family needs us644 to be above the poverty line joining education workers last week were judicial employees doctors and other public employees the strike which resolved nothing revealed how every political force in argentina has lined up against the education workers and the entire working class the argentine teachers union ctera which organized the 72 hour protest working from the same script as teachers unions across the world engaged in back room deals with the provincial governments and with the administration of president mauricio macri isolated and limited the strike to three days and used it to call on the teachers to support the populist and corporatist peronist parties a supporting and criminal role in conspiring against the argentine teachers struggle and attempting to keep workers tied to their trade unions to peronism and to the macri administration has been carried out by the pseudo trotskyists of the workers left front fit who campaign to pressure the trade unions to the left their nationalist demands for a broad electoral front of the entire left for asambleas de base members assemblies to pressure their own unions and to coordinate with other supposedly more militant unions are designed to detour the working class away from an independent struggle for political power this year s three day walkout was a poor repeat of the two day strike of 2018 in which the teachers also demanded wage increases to compensate for inflation at the time teachers rallied for days in downtown buenos aires teachers carried out repeated and very militant strikes and protests throughout 2017 and 2018 by keeping education wages below the rate of inflation and by starving public education of funds the macri administration has used the teachers as a way of disciplining the entire working class relying on a sell out agreement made with the cgt trade union federation in 2016 to keep workers divided and to limit the working class response to the level of isolated and toothless protest struggles confident in the support of the trade unions and peronist legislators in 2018 president macri unilaterally suppressed negotiations over salaries training programs federal support to education in poor provinces measures aimed at preventing school failures and other education issues this time in response to the three day strike maría eugenia vidal the right wing governor of buenos aires province threatened to withhold teachers wages during the demonstrations the province had promised a salary increase equivalent to the current rate of inflation plus 5 percent not payable until january 2020 no offer was made to make up for the purchasing power lost in 2018 as with the economic depression of 2001 2002 with unemployment rates of more than 25 percent argentina today is at the edge of a social explosion even the notoriously unreliable and politically manipulated statistics of the macri administration indicate near depression levels of unemployment and underemployment and skyrocketing levels of youth unemployment hidden behind the official rates of national unemployment 10 percent and youth unemployment 16 percent is the low labor force participation rate as workers give up looking for work and abandon the workforce argentina s labor force participation rate 49 percent of the labor force is 10 percentage points less than in brazil argentina s debt crisis and its agreement to a us57 billion imf rescue package contingent on the mass impoverishment of the population is further enriching the financial elite and the wall street vultures while widening the gap between the rich elites and agricultural oligarchies that the macri administration represents and the masses argentina s public debt of more than us300 billion simply cannot be paid there is really no way that the debt payment agreement with the imf and the wall street financiers and hedge funds can be carried out except for an all out war against the argentine working class at the same time the consequences of a debt default can be equally disastrous as the country is cut off from international credit markets and trade along with the impoverishment of the working class and of the lower middle class is an enormous increase in the wealth gap in truth poverty and inequality in argentina and every other country go hand in hand with the accumulation of obscene fortunes at the top of society whoever wins the 2019 presidential elections in october the banks and financial interests will continue to impose austerity and neoliberal policies while the vast majority starves and the most marginalized become truly transformed into a residuum of misery the telesur press agency recently reported that 3 4 million argentines 7 9 percent of the population limit themselves to one meal a day in a nation that produces an agricultural bounty each year capable of feeding 400 million people poverty rates continue to escalate currently almost one quarter of all argentines are in poverty

results of diana shipping inc for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 our performance strengthened significantly during the recent quarter and year as reflected in higher time charter revenues and the dramatic turnaround in profitability this is the result of the patient and focused strategy we have persistently followed over many years which position the company to take advantage of improving industry conditions in addition we took steps to fortify our balance sheet in 2018 while also demonstrating our strong belief in the company by conducting a self tender offer lastly we have continued to actively manage our fleet profile to optimize our mix of vessels and maintain our operational and financial flexibility to summarize our financial results diana shipping inc reported net income of 2 9 million and net income attributed to common stockholders of 1 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 this represents a turnaround from a net loss of 436 9 million and a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 438 4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 which included a 422 5 million impairment loss for the full year 2018 net income was 16 6 million and net income attributed to common stockholders was 10 8 this was a significant improvement compared with the net loss of 511 7 million and a net loss attributed to common stockholders of 517 5 million including the impairment loss for 2017 time charter revenues rose to 62 9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 from 48 9 million for the same quarter of 2017 mainly due to the increased average time charter rates that we have achieved for our vessels time charter revenues were 226 2 million for the full year of 2018 up from 161 9 million for 2017 turning to the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled a healthy 151 4 million at december 31 2018 long term debt net of deferred financing cost including the current portion was 530 5 million compared to stockholders equity of more than 627 7 million the company enhanced its financial flexibility during the 2018 fourth quarter by redeeming all of the outstanding 8 5 senior notes due 2020 at the aggregate principal amount of approximately 63 25 million this was made possible in part by our issuance during the third quarter of 100 million private placement of senior unsecured bonds maturing in september 2023 reflecting our commitment to return value to shareholders at the end of december 2018 the company completed the self tender offer to purchase up to 4 166 666 shares of our outstanding common stock at a price of 3 6 per share the board of directors determined that repurchasing the shares was in the company s best interest given our cash position and stock price in connection with our active management of the company s fleet in the 2018 fourth quarter we agreed to sell two vessels the alcyon for a sale price of 7 45 million before commissions and the triton for a sale price of 7 35 million before commissions in early 2019 we announced agreements to sell the vessels naias and dione at a sale price of 7 2 million each all four of these vessels were 2001 built and were among the oldest vessels in fleet we will continue to manage our fleet in a responsible manner that promotes a balance of time charter maturities and produces a predictable revenue stream as we look ahead in 2019 we will continue the prudent management of our financial position and our fleet and we ll maintain our focus on delivering value to our shareholders with that i ll now turn the call over to our president anastasios margaronis for a perspective on industry conditions he will then be followed by our chief financial officer andreas michalopoulos who will provide a more detailed financial overview thank you anastasios c margaronis president thank you simon and welcome to all the participants of this quarterly conference call of diana shipping inc last year started off on a very positive note in the bulk area market but things began to deteriorate and the market lost its gains and more toward the end of the year proof of this is baltic dry index which started the year at 1 282 and stood at only 637 on february 25 the baltic cape index moved from 1 987 to 520 over the same period and the baltic panamax index stood at 1 391 on january 2 closing yesterday at only 608 since mid october last year panamax rates are down by 52 while capesize rates are also down 32 over the same period let s start with macroeconomic developments which usually have a role to play in the medium to long term fortunes of the shipping industry in the eurozone the economy grew 1 8 in 2018 the imf predicts growth will slow down to a maximum of 1 6 this year with downside risks present in 2018 the chinese economy grew by 6 6 that was the slowest pace since 1990 but the comparison becomes rather meaningless if you look back in the context of the overall size of the chinese economy in 2018 and in 1990 for 2019 growth is expected to come in at 6 2 developing economies on the other hand grew at a brisk 4 6 in 2018 the imf expects growth to slow down to about 4 5 this year overall world gdp growth in 2018 was 3 7 and this rate of growth is expected to come down to 3 5 this year starting with steel now looking at commodities according to howe robinson chinese steel production rose nearly 10 in 2018 on the back of strong expansion in real estate and ongoing government infrastructure project howe robinson expects chinese steel production to fall in 2019 however they cite state sponsored projects such as the recently announced 125 billion rail network expansion to limit the extent of any decline steel stock piles in china at the end of december were approximately 9 2 million ton which was about 100 000 tonnes less than at the same time in 2017 turning to demand now for shipping overall according to clarksons total bulk carrier trade in 2018 reached the 29 339 trillion ton miles an increase of 2 8 compared to 2017 in 2019 they estimate that volumes will increase by 3 4 to reach 30 343 trillion ton miles in 2021 volumes are estimated to increase by 2 8 ph looking at iron ore now according to clarksons global seaborne iron ore trade is estimated to have contracted marginally to 1 47 billion tonnes in 2018 largely reflecting weaker shipments to china this was mainly caused by more scrap use in the countries of steel industry and a drawdown in port inventories in 2019 chinese iron ore imports are expected to increase by around 2 as the sharp drawdown in inventories seen last year is not expected to be repeated and the consumption of scrapping china s blast furnaces might fall back from the level seen last year the latter could be caused through the arrival of more high quality steel in the markets according to banchero costa the outlook for chinese iron ore imports in 2019 remains worried as higher iron ore prices and lower steel prices have cut into steel mill profit margins discouraging the steel mills from ramping up output and restocking raw materials according to clarksons following the disaster caused by the collapse over vale s corrego do feijao dam vale announced that 40 million tonnes per annum of iron ore production will be suspended to allow for the decommissioning of 10 000 dams over the next three years as a result overall brazilian iron ore shipments could be between 5 million tonnes and 50 ph million tonnes per year weaker than earlier projections this would amount to about 1 of seaborne iron ore trade or 0 3 ph of total annual bulk trade the interesting question is to try and determine where the shortfall in projected iron ore shipments might come from and what effect that would have on the overall ton mile demand for capes it is quite certain though that business for the vale sized bulkers would be negatively affected as a result of this disaster we need to keep in mind that these ships cannot be employed in any other routes but those envisaged by vale when they were design built as for coking coal now holding against to clarksons total world imports of coking coal could reach 275 million tonnes this year an increase of 3 compared to 2018 in 2020 the estimate is set at 282 million tonnes which would be a further increase of 2 inaudible chinese import demand and potentially weaker prices represent downside risks so do european union seaborne coking coal imports which are expected to show only marginal growth in the coming years thermal coal according to clarksons thermal coal imports are estimated to increase by 2 this year and reach 996 million tonnes and about 1 growth in 2020 this year china is expected to remain the world s largest seaborne steam coal importer although volumes are expected to fall slightly year on year when significant downside risks are present as mentioned below according to howe robinson the chinese government imposed restrictions on thermal coal imports from mid november onwards according to banchero costa india continues to have strong coal imports as domestic production shortfalls domestic logistics bottlenecks regulations targeting pollution cuts and surging demand for power from household electrification lead to higher imports from suppliers in indonesia south africa and the united states on top of all the above according to comodo research at the beginning of february china s six major coastal power plants had 14 7 million tonnes of coal in stock pile which was 50 higher than a year ago turning to grain cargos in the 2018 2019 grain season clarksons expected the grain imports to reach 500 million metric tonnes which if it materializes will be an increase of 4 in 2019 2020 the expectation is for a further increase of 3 to 515 million metric tonnes according to banchero costa global soybean trade is expected to contract by 0 7 in 2018 to 2019 grain mainly as lower chinese imports due to us trade tensions outweigh an increase in european imports turning to the supply now of tonnage newbuilding deliveries last year were 27 3 million deadweight compared with 37 1 million deadweight in 2017 this year newbuilding deliveries are expected to reach 37 million to 38 million deadweight comodo research are concerned by the fact that while in 2018 about 297 vessels were delivered this year the number is expected to be in the 330 to 430 range unless demolitions increase so as to compensate for this extra newbuilding tonnage supply might become an issue for the dry bulk market by increasing well over 3 which is currently anticipate by most analysts clarksons estimate fleet growth of 3 this year with fundamental looking fairly balanced with downside demand risks as mentioned already banchero costa also expects fleet growth of 3 for this year assuming demolition activity increases from its record low level seen in 2018 in line with expected increases in newbuilding deliveries this year clarksons believe that supply growth could be limited by the impact of the january 2020 global sulphur cap with bulk carriers out of commission to fit scrubbers absorbing about 0 5 of bulk fleet capacity across 2019 scrapping last year s demolition volumes of 4 million deadweight were the lowest seen for 10 years in 2017 13 6 million deadweight worth of capacity was scrapped in 2019 banchero costa expect the scrapping to reach at least 10 million deadweight tonne with scrapping slowing down significantly in 2018 to just over 4 million deadweight tonne the average age of the bulk carrier fleet went up from 9 1 years at the end of 2017 to 9 6 years last december a quick look at the order book now according to clarksons at the end of last year there were 88 5 million deadweight tons worth of ships on order representing 11 of the bulk carrier fleet the capesize order book was 49 9 million deadweight tons which was 15 of the existing fleet and 20 9 million deadweight tons of panamax s were on order the equivalent of 10 of the existing fleet nearly half of this newbuilding tonnage is scheduled for delivery this year while the rest will be delivered in 2020 and beyond so what kind of an outlook do analysts provide us with all these data comodo research are rather bearish on the prospects of the world economy and for the dry bulk market as a whole they point out that the vale incident is a new headwind for the capesize market that will require continued evaluation the positive news they cite in this sector is the arrest of an elderly vloc conversion this might reveal problems known in some circles for a while now about the structural integrity of these ships it is possible that the further trading of these vessels might be suspended if the supply and demand forecast described earlier unmaterialize this year rates should improve from their present depressed levels on the other hand clarksons report that while overall demand supply outlook for the bulk carrier sector in 2019 looks broadly balanced a number of significant downside risks to the demand side are clear these range from global economic concerns to uncertainty over the outlook of china s coal and iron ore imports clarksons counter balanced these negative factors by pointing out that increased demolition and vessel of higher time for scrubber retrofits mentioned earlier could have a positive impact on this note we will pass the call over to our cfo andreas michalopoulos who will provide us with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter of last year and for 2018 as a whole thank you andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer thank you stasi and good morning i am pleased to be discussing today with you diana s operational results for the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2018 net income and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to 2 9 million and 1 5 million respectively earnings per common share were 0 01 time charter revenues increased to 62 9 million compared to 48 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was due to the increased average time charter rates that we achieved for our vessels during the quarter this increase was partly offset by a decreasing revenues due to the sale of the vessels alcyon and triton in december 2018 ownership days were 4 554 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 4 624 in the same quarter of 2017 fleet utilization was 99 1 compared to 98 9 for the same quarter of 2017 and the daily time charter equivalent rate was 13 527 compared to 9 949 for the same quarter of 2017 voyage expenses were 2 7 million for the quarter compared to 3 million for the same quarter of 2017 and the decrease in voyage expenses was due to a gain from bunkers of 0 7 million compared to a loss of 0 5 million in the same quarter of 2017 vessel operating expenses amounted to 25 2 million compared to 24 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased by 5 the increase was due to increasing insurances repairs and maintenance costs of the vessels and taxes daily operating expenses were 5 536 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 5 195 for the same quarter of 2017 representing an increase of 7 depreciation and amortization of deferred charges amounted to 13 million general and administrative expenses were 9 million compared to 8 2 million for the same quarter last year the increase was mainly due to increased payroll and training costs and the exchange rate of euro to us dollars management fees to related party were 0 6 million compared to 0 5 million last year due to the increased average number of vessels managed by diana wilhelmsen interest and finance costs amounted to 9 million compared to 6 8 million in the same quarter of 2017 this increase was attributable to increased average interest rates in the quarter compared to the same quarter of 2017 and was partly offset by decreased average debt interest and other income amounted to 0 8 million compared to 1 5 million for the same quarter last year the decrease was due to the repayment of the loan due from diana containerships for the year now ended december 31 2018 net income amounted to 16 6 million and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to 10 8 million earnings per share was 0 10 time charter revenues increased to 226 2 million compared to 161 9 million for 2017 the increase was attributable to increased average time charter rates that we achieved through our vessels during the year less a five ph days compared to 2017 ownership days in 2018 were 18 204 compared to 18 119 fleet utilization was 99 1 compared to 98 2 in 2017 and the

increase in operating expenses was due to increased insurances repairs and maintenance costs and taxes daily operating expenses in 2018 were 5 247 compared to 4 987 for 2017 representing a 5 increase depreciation and amortization of deferred charges amounted to 52 2 million in 2018 general and administrative expenses increased to 29 5 million compared to 26 3 million in 2017 mainly due to increased payroll and training costs increased bod fees and legal fees and the exchange rate of fuel to us dollars management fee to related party was 2 4 million compared to 1 9 million in 2017 the increase was due to an increased average number of vessels managed by diana wilhelmsen during the year compared to 2017 interest and finance costs amounted to 30 5 million compared to 26 6 million in 2017 this increase was attributable to increased average interest rates compared to last year while average debt is decreasing interest and other income amounted to 8 8 million compared to 4 5 million in 2017 this increase was mainly due to the payment of the 5 million discount price which was recorded in income on the date of the loan repayment by diana containerships inc thank you for your attention we would now be pleased to respond to your question and i will turn the call to the operator who will instruct you as to the procedure for asking questions operator thank you sir at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from noah parquette with jpmorgan please state your question noah parquette j p morgan analyst great thanks i just wanted to ask you guys wanted to ask about use of cash flow obviously the tender in q4 that was one drive off because that was kind of pre the vale news and the market moved lower i mean how are you in terms of your comfortable like a liquidity buffer at this point given where rates are i mean would you consider more moves like the tender or taking up the deferred stock or are you kind of want to see a little bit extra liquidity out there ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary no this is ioannis zafirakis speaking we are considering the cash position that we have today to be sufficient on the conservative side of the business i have to say as we were trying to explain earlier we feel that the fare meter is on the high side and there is some justification for being afraid for the demand and certainly there is the thought of the demand going down but we also believe that these may have been a little bit overestimated which has led also supply to be on the low side lower than what should have been and the net effect most probably is going to be much more positive than everybody thinks having said that to answer your question directly we think that the liquidity the cash that we have aside is more than enough and don t forget that we are selling also vessels and therefore a tender offer is not out of the question noah parquette j p morgan analyst okay that s clear and then i just wanted to ask about the 2001 built ships that you re selling one you still have i think one more it s safe to assume that s up on the block too are those just trying to get a sense of or two more are those going to scrap or are those going to trade just to get a sense how scrapping will shape up this year ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary no no those vessels are fully tradable they ve been sold to before the trading andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer the scrap value of those vessels is almost half of what they have been sold for noah parquette j p morgan analyst yes okay great thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from randy giveans with jefferies please state your question randy giveans jefferies analyst yes so two quick questions for me so diana obviously been very active in the time charter market in recent months and it was kind of continuous but is that specifically due to kind of a weaker outlook for short term spot rates or just an ongoing strategic decision to kind of keep rechartering vessels to maintain 75 80 time charter coverage for the next six months to nine months ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary you are closer to the second explanation as we have done since 2005 we keep our strategy the same chartering of our vessels is staggering process we will continue doing that i m not that 100 certain whether it is 70 or 80 that you mentioned it is absolutely correct we don t have such a target in our mind what we have as a target is to have a vessel opening every 15 days or 20 days we are trying our best not to have a lot of vessels opening at the same time and this is what we will continue doing randy giveans jefferies analyst sure okay and then looking at the balance sheet now on kind of where it is currently after some refinancings and whatnot can you provide a quarterly debt amor for this year and maybe for 2020 any big balloons in the near term anastasios c margaronis president yes so as we had stated we had a loan for motor vessel maera which had a balloon and a maturity amount of 12 1 million and that was maturing on the 4th of january this was repaid this loan was repaid and we have the vessel now that is without a mortgage so this was a conscious decision within our strategy to slightly de lever the company we decided to repay that vessel considering motor vessel crystalia and atalandi those two vessels we had a maturing installment a maturing balloon and installment of 21 million that we also repaid a few days ago it was maturing a few days ago on that amount we are nearly concluded to refinance those two vessels as soon as we refinance them you will be the first to know but we are in final stages of refinancing those two vessels for about 19 million for both and finally within our maturities you have a loan for ismene and selina with the maturity amount of around 20 million maturing on the 30th of june we intend to also refinance those two vessels at maturity and this should be absolutely no problem for us to do that last but not least motor vessel houston is maturing at the end of the year with a balloon installment of 4 9 million on the november 19th we have not decided yet what we re going to do at that point in time of the year with that amount what is important for you to know is that we have banks that are there to refinance our vessels and that s point number one and point number two is that we do not want as ioannis said i think at the beginning of the call to diminish our cash balance in the balance sheet we are at the point in the cycle where we are building the balance sheet and the cash in the balance sheet and we intend to do that randy giveans jefferies analyst got it and in kind of just for total debt amor for this year and next year not necessarily including the vessel sales just kind of scheduled debt amor anastasios c margaronis president you will see all that in the 20 f but basically for this year is around 100 million all inclusive and for next year it s about 40 million and a lot in the half for the next six years but i think in a few days you will have the 20 f filing that we will do and you will have all that in greater detail which is most important for you at that time randy giveans jefferies analyst yes excellent and then i guess one quick housekeeping question so yeah congrats on that tender offer now following those share repurchases what is the current share count that we should use for 2019 ioannis zafirakis chief strategy officer and secretary you want the exact number it s 103 million shares something you want the exact number andreas michalopoulos chief financial officer 103 764 351 randy giveans jefferies analyst 103 764 351 now we re talking all right thanks again gentlemen have it going operator thank you operator instructions ladies and gentlemen there appears to be no additional requests for questions i ll turn it back to management for closing remarks thank you simeon p palios chairman and chief executive officer thank you again for your interest

volatile unregulated investment products no eu investor protection what is bitcoin trading uk if you re new to the world of cryptocurrency speculation then it important that you understand the difference between investing in and trading bitcoin the former simply means that you will be buying bitcoin keeping hold of the investment for several months or years and then hopefully cash out at a higher price this is no different from investing in traditional shares however bitcoin trading is a completely different kettle of fish to investing in the long term this is because you will be looking to actively buy and sell bitcoin pairs making small but frequent profits from ever changing prices here s a quick example of how bitcoin trading works in practice you deposit 500 into a bitcoin trading platform you want to trade btc gbp which is the exchange rate between bitcoin and the british pound the pair is currently priced at 14 500 you think that the exchange rate will rise so you place a 500 buy order a few days later btc gbp is worth 16 000 representing an increase of 10 3 you close your bitocin trade so on a stake of 500 you made 51 50 as you can see from the above you kept your bitcoin trading position open for just a few days however some traders will often keep a position open for a matter of hours or even minutes this is known as day trading and it involves placing several positions throughout the day it is also important for us to explain that there are two types of pairs that bitcoin trading platforms uk offer this covers crypto to fiat and crypto cross pairs which we explain in more detail below alternatively if you re looking for the best crypto lending platform you might want to check out our nexo review crypto to fiat pairs the term fiat refers to a traditional currency like the british pound or us dollar as such by trading crypto to fiat pairs you will be trading the exchange rate between bitcoin and a mainstream currency the vast majority of this space is dominated by bitcoin and the us dollar with the pair represented as btc usd this pair benefits from the largest amount of trading volume tightest spreads and huge amounts of liquidity as such this is the best bitcoin trading pair to focus on with that said bitcoin trading platforms like coinbase offer several other crypto to fiat pairs that contain bitcoin this includes the following btc gbp bitcoin and the british pound btc jpy bitcoin and the japanese yen btc aud bitcoin and the australian dollar btc eur bitcoin and the euro as such if you feel more comfortable trading bitcoin against the pound then coinbase is going to be your best option crypto cross pairs the best bitcoin trading platforms uk also offer crypto cross pairs put simply this means that you will be trading bitcoin against another cryptocurrency popular pairs include btc eth ethereum btc xrp ripple and btc eos eos here s an example of how a crypto cross pair works at a bitcoin trading platform uk you want to trade btc eth which is the exchange rate between bitcoin and ethereum the pair is currently priced at 31 50 you think that the exchange rate will rise so you place a 200 buy order a few days later btc eth is worth 40 30 representing an increase of 27 9 you close your trade so on a stake of 200 you made 55 80 as you can see from the above there is no fiat currency involved in the pair this can make it difficult to quantify your profits and losses as a result if you have little knowledge of how bitcoin trading works it s best to stick with crypto to fiat pairs bitcoin trading price an additional learning curve that you need to get your head around is that of the bitcoin trading price after all this digital currency does not exist in physical form so a lot of newbie investors can t quite comprehend how its value is derived the good news is that the value of bitcoin works no different from any other asset class that is to say the bitcoin trading price will go up and down on a second by second basis fully dictated by market forces so if the demand for bitcoin is high more people will buy it in turn the price of bitcoin will naturally go up and of course the same is true when demand for bitcoin is low meaning its price will decline as you can now see this is exactly the same as stock trading or forex trading crucially bitcoin is traded on public exchanges this means that its value will rise and fall naturally depending on where the money is past performance is not an indication of future results automated bitcoin trading make no mistake about it generating profits by buying and selling pairs at a bitcoin trading platform uk is no easy feat after all you need to have a firm understanding of how technical analysis works especially if you are trading in the short term learning how to read charts effectively will take months or even years to master this shouldn t dishearten you however as there are several ways you can bypass the need to perform in depth chart analysis this includes bitcoin trading robots third party signals and copy trading let s explore how each of these bitcoin trading strategies works and whether or not they are suitable for your financial goals bitcoin trading robots automated trading is big business in the traditional stock and forex trading scenes in fact the vast majority of hedge funds and financial institutions utilize advanced robots to buy and sell assets on their behalf after all automated robots have the capacity to perform at a significantly faster rate than the human brain this means the robot can operate 24 7 subsequently scanning thousands of markets at any given time fortunately these bitcoin automated trading robots are not reserved just for large institutions on the contrary there are thousands of robot providers active in the space some good some bad and some very ugly don t invest in crypto assets unless you re prepared to lose all the money you invest as such you need to perform lots of research on the robot provider before signing up nevertheless in order to make use of a bitcoin trading robot you will need to use an online broker that compatible with mt4 this is

the amount of margin that you can trade with is dictated by esma although the uk has technically left the eu these rules still remain in place this means that the most you can apply is 1 30 major forex pairs with other assets coming with lower limits in order to access these markets you need to use a cfd broker now up until january 2021 bitcoin trading platforms uk could offer cryptocurrency cfds with leverage of 1 2 this meant that a 100 stake would give you 200 in trading capital however the fca has since announced that come the new year crypto cfds are no longer available to uk residents with that in mind the only way that you will be able to engage with bitcoin margin trading is to use an unregulated offshore broker that offers crypto derivatives it will come as no surprise to hear that we strongly suggest avoiding such platforms as your capital is at risk after all if the broker collapses it will likely take your funds with it bitcoin forex trading bitcoin trading has a lot in common with forex trading so much so that it s sometimes referred to as bitcoin forex trading you can change pounds for bitcoin with the best bitcoin trading platform uk just like you would change pounds for dollars with a forex broker bitcoin is typically traded in a currency pair with the us dollar however some bitcoin trading platforms give you more flexibility you can trade bitcoin directly against the pound or the euro for example or trade bitcoin against another cryptocurrency like ethereum are bitcoin trading platforms legal in the uk yes bitcoin trading platforms are legal in the uk as long as they adhere to regulatory guidelines the best bitcoin trading platforms in the uk are regulated by the financial conduct authority fca who monitor trading platforms to ensure that they operate safely one of the biggest reasons that people in the uk are wary about trading bitcoin is the legal standing of cryptocurrencies in the uk it is legal to use bitcoin trading platforms including platforms that are not regulated by the fca however if a bitcoin trading platform causes harm to traders to financial markets the fca could take action and put a ban in place it is illegal to use a bitcoin trading platform that has been banned in the uk this is because platforms that are banned by the fca could be harmful to consumers or markets the best way to ensure that you are trading bitcoin legally is to use a platform that is regulated by the financial conduct authority benefits of trading with the best bitcoin trading platform uk there are many benefits as well as risks of using bitcoin trading platforms to buy and sell crypto assets let s start with the benefits innovative and revolutionary technology the obvious starting point here is that bitcoin albeit 12 years old is still a new and exciting technology that is still well in its infancy the underlying technology the blockchain can do things that we have never seen before for example it allows people to send and receive bitcoin without needing a third party transactions are not tied to the real identity of the sender or receiver it takes just 10 minutes for fund transfers to arrive irrespective of location transactions fees are super low in addition to the above bitcoin is decentralized this means that the government or central bank can t own or take control of it all in all the above characteristics mean that by trading bitcoin you can enter the crypto market at a very early stage this is no different from investing in top rated internet stocks like amazon back in the 1990s but of course there is no guarantee that you will make money by trading bitcoin so do bear this in mind lots of bitcoin trading markets as we briefly covered earlier the best uk bitcoin trading platforms offer heaps of markets this covers both crypto to fiat and crypto cross pairs this ensures that you can take full advantage of short term price movements for example you might think that bitcoin is undervalued against the british pound and place a trade accordingly don t invest in crypto assets unless you re prepared to lose all the money you invest on another occasion you might think that bitcoin is underpriced against ethereum whatever your prediction bitcoin trading platforms offer heaps of pairs and markets that you can access at the click of a button 24 7 trading when you trade traditional assets like stocks and shares you can only do so during standard market hours for example the london stock exchange operates between 8 am and 4 pm monday to friday as such anything trades outside these hours must wait until the market reopens however bitcoin trading platforms uk operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week sure you might not have a requirement to buy and sell bitcoin during the early hours of sunday morning but knowing that the markets never close is a handy safeguard to have after all you might want to cash out your position instantly and not want to wait until monday morning to be able to do so huge trading volumes back in the early days of bitcoin trading volume was minute this went from a few hundred dollars a day to thousands and eventually millions however fast forward to 2022 and bitcoin trading platforms collectively see billions of pounds worth of activity each and every day in fact in the 24 hours prior to writing this guide there has been more than 31 billion worth of activity on btc usd alone across the entire cryptocurrency trading industry this figure stands at over 138 billion in the past 24 hours low barrier to entry the best bitcoin trading platforms uk allow you to get started with ease it typically takes just minutes to open an account and brokers like coinbase allow you to instantly deposit funds with a uk debit credit card or e wallet best of all you can trade bitcoin with small amounts go long or short when you trade bitcoin pairs like btc usd this allows you to go long or short this means that you can speculate on the price of bitcoin rising as well as falling however there is a slight caveat to this benefit as we noted earlier the fca introduced new regulations that mean that from january 2021 uk residents can no longer trade crypto cfd products this was the go to avenue to short sell cryptocurrencies like bitcoin the good news is that you can still short sell bitcoin if this is something you want to achieve in order to do this you will need to trade a crypto to crypto pair like btc usdt this means that you will be trading bitcoin against tether which is pegged to the us dollar as such this works in the same way as trading btc usd via cfds bitcoin trading risks now that we have covered the benefits we should discuss the risks of bitcoin trading risk of loss it goes without saying that any asset class can lose you money when trading it online this is no different from trading bitcoin as such you need to understand the financial risks involved as we cover shortly you can mitigate these risks by deploying a sensible risk management strategy high volatility bitcoin is a new and often volatile digital currency meaning that you stand the chance of losing more than you had hoped this is because the cryptocurrency can move by more than 10 in a single day of trading this is much more likely to happen than a blue chip stock so do bear this in mind wider spreads when you trade established stable stocks you will find that the spreads on offer are super competitive however as bitcoin trading platforms experience high levels of volatility throughout the day this often results in wider spreads for those unaware this is the difference between the buy and sell price of bitcoin the wider the spread the more you indirectly pay in fees for example at coinbase while the spreads on major stocks average 0 2 to 0 25 with bitcoin it is usually 0 75 understand crypto wallets depending on which bitcoin trading platform you sign up with you might need to have an understanding of how crypto wallets work this is because cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are stored in a digital wallet on your desktop or mobile device this means that you need to have an understanding of private keys public addresses and backup phrases fortunately if you use a regulated broker like coinbase you won t need to worry about knowing the ins and outs of crypto wallets this is because coinbase will safeguard your digital coins in their own wallet bitcoin trading strategies trading bitcoin and expecting to make a profit from day one is wishful thinking after all you need to understand what drives the price of bitcoin and thus how to capitalize from this to help you along the way below we have listed some of the most utilized bitcoin trading strategies buy and hold if you re looking to trade bitcoin as a complete novice then it might be best to stick with a simple buy and hold strategy this entails buying bitcoin and then holding on to the investment long term this might be for several months or even years the reason that this strategy is useful for newbies is that you do not need to worry about short term volatility in turn this also means that you don t need to have a grasp of technical analysis which is the art of reading charts swing trading if you re prepared to learn the ins and outs of technical and fundamental analysis then you might want to consider swing trading this is a short term approach to bitcoin trading as you will be looking to stay with wider trends for example if bitcoin is on a prolonged downward trend then you will want to short sell the digital currency skilled swing traders will look to keep this sell position open for as long as the bitcoin trend is bearish when it appears the trend is coming to an end the swing trader will exit the position then if and when a new upward trend kicks in the swing trader will once again capitalize only this time with a buy order day trading day trading is the process of buying and selling bitcoin pairs throughout the day in fact as most positions remain open for just minutes or hours rarely do day trading keep an order open overnight as you can imagine keeping hold of a position for such a small amount of time will result in minute profit margins however it is important to remember that day traders will usually place heaps of trades every day so these small profits can quickly add up take note day traders rely almost exclusively on technical indicators as such if you like the sound of day trading bitcoin you will need to understand how to read charts and perform in depth analysis is bitcoin trading safe bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency scene has been the victim of several wide scale scams in the past this includes ponzi schemes bogus funding raising projects and exchange hacks plus bitcoin is often the preferred currency for criminals due to its anonymous characteristics with that being said bitcoin trading can be safe if you follow a crucial rule only use regulated platforms as such by using regulated bitcoin trading platforms uk you can ensure that you are able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies safely on the other hand there are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges in the space that still operate without a license so be extra careful when picking a platform that we haven t discussed on this page risk management irrespective of which of the above bitcoin trading strategies you decide to deploy it is crucial that you have a risk management plan in place as the name suggests this will ensure that you are able to trade bitcoin in a risk averse manner in its most basic form you can achieve this goal by ensuring that you always set up stop loss and take profit orders on each trade stop loss orders this is an order that allows you to limit your potential losses for example you might decide that you do not want to risk more than 5 of your trading capital as such you simply need to place a stop loss order 5 above or below your entry price depending on whether you are long or short this is an order that allows you to limit your potential losses for example you might decide that you do not want to risk more than 5 of your trading capital as such you simply need to place a stop loss order 5 above or below your entry price depending on whether you are long or short take profit orders this order type allows you to set a clear profit target before you enter the trade for example if you place a take profit order at 10 the bitcoin trading platform uk will close the position if this target is met this also ensures that you don t need to spend hours at your computer waiting to close the trade manually crucially these orders although not compulsory should always be added to your trade how to get started on the best bitcoin trading

eligibility and written description between 2010 and 2014 the supreme court issued a series of decisions bilski mayo myriad and alice that significantly impacted patent eligibility law and continue to generate substantial public debate in the wake of these decisions as well as numerous federal circuit decisions applying what is now known as the mayo alice two step framework the uspto has striven to provide guidance to patent examiners and the public on its understanding of these decisions the uspto issued new guidance in a federal register notice published on january 7 2019 revising the procedure at the uspto for determining whether a patent application claim or patent claim is directed to a judicial exception a law of nature natural phenomenon or an abstract idea under the first step of the mayo alice framework the revision is two fold first the new guidance explains that abstract ideas pursuant to case law generally fall within one of three groups mathematical concepts certain methods of organizing human activity or mental processes second and pursuant to two centuries of case law the new guidance explains that a patent application claim or patent claim that recites a judicial exception is not directed to the judicial exception if the judicial exception is integrated into a practical application of the judicial exception the uspto recently sought public comment on this new guidance and comments were requested by march 8 2019 the uspto previously issued guidance in a federal register notice published on april 20 2018 pertaining to the inquiry into whether an additional element or elements represent well understood routine conventional activity under the second step of the mayo alice framework the uspto similarly sought public comment on that guidance the uspto has trained patent examiners on the april 2018 and the january 2019 guidance and is in the process of ascertaining what further training is appropriate in addition in june 2018 the uspto issued guidance on how to evaluate the patent eligibility of method of treatment claims in view of the federal circuit s decision in vanda the uspto s patent eligibility guidance training materials and other documents including frequently asked questions are available on the uspto s website the guidance is designed to increase the certainty and predictability of the patent eligibility analyses and provide a more consistent analytical framework to guide inventors practitioners examiners and the public in finding the appropriate lines to draw with respect to patent eligible subject matter the uspto also issued additional guidance in the federal register notice published on january 7 2019 for the examination of claims in patent applications that contain functional language particularly patent applications where functional language is used to claim computer implemented inventions the guidance addresses written description and enablement issues under 35 u s c 112 a particularly relating to computer implemented functional claims that recite only a solution or outcome to a problem without reciting how the solution or outcome is accomplished the guidance further addresses issues related to the examination of computer implemented functional claims having means plus function limitations under 35 u s c 112 f the uspto sought and is reviewing public comments on this new guidance we have now also implemented training for patent examiners on this guidance i will continue to engage stakeholders and the public about ways to reduce the uncertainty around these critical areas of patent law patent pendency and inventory the ip system must be efficient and the uspto is continuing to work to ensure that patents issue within a timely manner subject to the statutory guidelines the timely issuance of patents helps to provide certainty in the marketplace and helps businesses and innovators make informed decisions on the development and marketing of their products and services in fy 2019 the uspto expects to receive more than 600 000 patent applications the inventory of unexamined patent applications is currently approximately 550 000 which is down from more than 750 000 in 2009 in terms of processing patent applications the average time to first office action first action pendency has been reduced from 25 9 months in january 2009 to a current level of 15 9 months and our goal is to reduce that number to less than 15 months by the end of fy 2019 average total pendency has fallen from 33 8 months in january 2009 to a current level of 23 7 months and our goal 4 is to maintain that number at less than 24 months through the end of fy 2019 updates to examiner performance evaluation the uspto recently informed its examining corps of some important updates anticipated to take effect in fy 2020 which will bring the examination process in better alignment with the uspto s goals of providing predictable and reliable patents rights to stakeholders in particular these updates revise the evaluation of examiner performance of patent examining duties via the examiner performance appraisal plan pap the updated pap establishes a roadmap for enhanced patent quality by providing examiners with a list of best practices in the areas of search clarity of the written prosecution record and principles of compact prosecution this roadmap provides a greater emphasis on search by highlighting the importance of searching the inventive concept as disclosed in an application so as to identify the best prior art in the case at the earliest possible time in prosecution patent quality providing high quality efficient examination of patent applications is key to the issuance of reliable patent rights the uspto s actions whether to reject a patent application or allow a patent application have a real world impact on applicants the public and the economy in general quality patents are those that issue in compliance with all the requirements of title 35 of the united states code as well as relevant case law at the time of issuance and are able to survive challenge down the line performing a thorough prior art search to help issue claims of proper scope is an important part of issuing quality patents that can stand up to scrutiny if challenged in addition any action issued by the office must include sufficient detail so that applicants and the public can better determine the basis for examiner decisions the uspto is focusing on improving examiner searches through the following initiatives training the uspto has evaluated the training offered to examiners with a goal of increasing available training opportunities this includes training on proper search techniques and search strategies as well as training on search tools particularly for foreign patents and non patent literature providing additional resources to examiners the uspto is also providing additional resources for examiners to assist with prior art searches when needed this includes making available internal experts to help with search strategies based on technology and classification as well as assistance with available search tools an internal task force is determining how information technology such as artificial intelligence can be leveraged to assist with locating and retrieving prior art for examiners as i discussed last year we constantly seek ways to improve prior art searching and the quality of examination exploring new processes the uspto is also testing new processes that can help with enhancing prior art searches including pilot programs that serve to test these processes this includes for example collaborative search pilots between multiple uspto examiners as well as between uspto examiners and examiners from foreign patent offices the uspto also recently concluded a pilot program to help examiners identify applications that would 5 benefit from a pre search interview so that any confusion with issues like claim construction can be resolved prior to performing an initial prior art search the uspto is increasing transparency and collaboration between internal and external stakeholders by providing guidance and educational opportunities to external stakeholders the uspto s stakeholder training on examination practice and procedure stepp program is a 3 day course that provides external stakeholders with a better understanding of how and why an examiner makes decisions while examining a patent application based on the success of stepp the uspto now also provides virtual instructor led training classes which consist of short 2 hour courses on various patent topics in addition the uspto holds monthly quality chat webinars with external stakeholders on patent quality topics with a substantial portion of the time reserved to answer questions from stakeholders and capture their feedback patent quality is a shared responsibility with external stakeholders and continued collaboration will lead to an improvement in the quality of incoming applications examiner training providing training and guidance to uspto s employees is of utmost importance for supporting high quality examination examiner training is provided for both newly hired and experienced examiners and may be delivered corps wide or to specific disciplines legal training already completed this fiscal year includes extensive training to employees on the examiner guidance issued in january 2019 related to subject matter eligibility the first phase of this training was completed in february in addition training on 35 u s c 112 is currently in process and other training under development for delivery later this year includes training on claim interpretation restriction court decisions and prior art rejections the uspto also conducts examiner quality chats in a webinar format to cover a range of patent quality topics and collaborates with stakeholders to provide technical training for examiners to enhance their subject matter expertise the uspto s patent examiner technical training program provides opportunities for technologists scientists engineers and other experts from industry and academia to voluntarily provide technical training and expertise to patent examiners in person or virtually from their location the site experience education program provides an opportunity for commercial industrial and academic institutions within the continental united states to voluntarily host patent examiners for technical site visits organizations who volunteer to host these examiner visits contribute to improving the quality of patent examination by keeping patent examiners updated on the latest technologies and innovations in their field of examination customer experience the uspto is committed to improving the customer experience consistent with the president s management agenda the uspto has taken steps to better understand the perceptions of the ip community across multiple customer user groups in order to deliver an outstanding experience that is consistent clear and intuitive the uspto is currently gathering customer feedback data and using the information to continuously improve processes and tools by measuring customer feedback and then providing transparency on customer experience performance it provides its customers and stakeholders a voice at the table and motivates business units within the uspto to work together toward common customer oriented outcomes so that the uspto remains the global leader in intellectual property fee setting authority in september 2018 the uspto exercised the fee setting authority that congress recently extended in the success act and began the process of adjusting its patent fees by working with the patent public advisory committee to host a special public hearing on new proposed patent fees these proposed fees were based on a biennial review of our fees that the agency conducted in fy 2017 where we determined that patent fee adjustments are needed to provide the uspto with a sufficient amount of revenue to recover its aggregate costs for patent operations the uspto anticipates that the proposals will take effect in january 2021 which is three years after the previous adjustments the uspto must consider what the financial needs of the office will be at that time and beyond in short the proposed fees provide the resources and flexibility the uspto needs to continue reducing the patent application backlog shortening patent pendency improving patent quality enhancing patent administrative appeal and post grant processes engaging effectively internationally and improving our it infrastructure these fee proposals will also enable the uspto to continue to build retain and effectively manage the highly educated and talented workforce it needs to properly serve our stakeholder community 3 patent trial and appeal board america invents act aia trial filings and ex parte appeals the uspto s patent and trial appeal board ptab conducts aia trial proceedings and adjudicates ex parte appeals of examiners final rejections since 2012 when the aia trial provisions became effective the uspto has received more than 9 700 trial petition filings and has issued more than 4 900 decisions on institution and nearly 2 500 final written decisions within the statutory due dates additionally the uspto reduced the inventory of ex parte appeals from nearly 13 000 cases in fiscal year 2017 to fewer than 11 000 cases in fiscal year 2018 with a goal of reaching a steady state of 10 000 cases pending at any one time the uspto also reduced ex parte appeal pendency in fiscal year 2018 to an average of 15 3 months from an average of 17 8 months in fiscal year 2017 with an ultimate goal of about 12 months issuance of procedural improvements and guidance the uspto has made several significant improvements to aia trial proceedings during the past year for enhanced transparency fairness certainty and predictability first the uspto published a final rule in federal register harmonizing the claim construction standard to match the federal courts second the uspto issued a request for comments and proposed pilot program on motion to amend practice to give patent owners a second opportunity to amend their claims after receiving feedback third the uspto released an updated trial practice guide to provide additional guidance on trial procedures such as the use of sur replies pre hearing conferences institution factors hearing times proper use of expert testimony and motions to strike and exclude fourth the uspto released guidance to implement the supreme court sas decision concerning partial institution of aia trials and the federal circuit aqua products decision regarding the burden of proof for establishing the patentability of proposed amended claims finally the uspto published two standard operating procedures for the ptab one for paneling cases and the second for issuing precedential decisions we are monitoring our implementation of the various improvements to ensure optimal usage likewise we are continuing to assess other possible changes to the aia trial standards and processes for instance to manage the proceedings even more effectively we are endeavoring to issue more precedential decisions and possibly a second update to the trial practice guide ensuring the high quality of decisions the uspto has taken a number of actions to issue high timely decisions and enhance decisional quality the ptab administers weekly legal training to ensure judges patent attorneys law clerks and paralegals are knowledgeable on the latest legal and policy developments additionally the ptab participated in an intra agency working group to develop the newly released guidance for determining subject matter eligibility under 101 and conducted extensive training on the application of this guidance to ensure its consistent application collaborating with patent examiners the ptab is enhancing its collaboration with the patent examiners in furtherance of a one agency goal the ptab is delivering quarterly training to examiners on various topics such as the law of obviousness to aid examiners in strengthening their legal analysis and work product additionally the ptab has conducted two joint studies with patents the first study assessed the use of parallel proceedings before the ptab and patent examiners on the same patent the second study focused on the frequency in occurrence of prior art and arguments raised in trials that were previously considered by the examiner during the examination of the challenged patent the results of these studies will be ready to share with the public soon the ptab and patents are continuing to explore ways to engage for education and mutual benefit enhancing transparency the uspto increasingly disseminates data about aia trials and ex parte appeals to enable data driven decision making and to better educate stakeholders as part of this effort the uspto publishes monthly statistics about its proceedings additionally the uspto continues to conduct and publish studies on certain aspects of aia trials in response to stakeholder feedback during the past year the uspto published studies on motions to amend expanded panels and trial outcomes for orange book listed patents uspto also is working to replace ptab s legacy it systems a new system for aia trials has already been launched and the system for ex parte appeals is under development there will be a follow on investment to enhance the functionality of the new it system to keep pace with changing business needs the ptab also revamped its website to be more user friendly including the addition of features that enable quick identification of new procedures processes and precedent finally the ptab hosts periodic webinars and participates in various speaking engagements to keep the public abreast of current developments 4 trademark operations and initiatives the uspto registers marks trademarks service marks certification marks and collective membership marks that meet the requirements of the trademark act we create and maintain the federal register of trademarks that now includes approximately 2 4 million registrations federal trademark registration provides important benefits to trademark owners that help them to enforce rights in their mark against unauthorized users and to enlist the help of u s customs and border protection to exclude counterfeit goods from importation the register itself includes notice to applicants other trademark owners and our examining attorneys of the registrant s claim of ownership in a mark and allows them to search the availability of marks for registration in the united states trademark pendency and quality have been impressive during the recent period of immense growth during this time the uspto has devoted considerable resources on measures to address inaccurate and sometimes fraudulent claims of use that undermine the reliability of the use based trademark register the unauthorized practice of law in trademark matters has grown markedly and the uspto has responded by instituting random audits of post registration maintenance filings to require proof of use for specific goods or services in the registration obtaining software to aid our ability to detect fake specimens of use and proposing a rule requiring that foreign domiciled parties use an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the united states to represent them in trademark matters before the uspto the uspto is exploring additional measures and welcomes the opportunity to discuss them with the public and this committee performance goals for more than a decade the uspto has met or exceeded its trademark pendency and quality targets despite sustained growth since 2008 trademarks have been registered in less than 12 months from filing an application on average with a first action issued between 2 5 and 3 5 months from filing the uspto and its trademark stakeholders consider these to be optimal pendency rates first and final action compliance rates measuring examination quality continue to be high customers are filing 99 9 percent of all new applications electronically and the number of trademark applications processed completely electronically has also increased this benefits workflow processes data collection and file management the uspto continues to engage the public to identify ways to efficiently process trademark applications with a goal of requiring all new filings and communications to be electronic in fy 2019 managing growth and maintaining pendency and quality trademark application filings historically have averaged annual increases between 6 percent and 8 percent during the last 34 years with only 4 years of negative growth during that period application filings for fy 2018 increased by 7 5 percent although our forecast for fy 2019 was for a 6 percent filing increase so far this fiscal year our filings have actually decreased by about 2 percent compared to the same period in fy 2018 we now expect application filings to remain approximately flat for the fiscal year and forecasts indicate that annual increases are expected to average less than the historical average during the next eight years improving the accuracy of the register for the public and the uspto to reliably determine whether a mark is available for registration the trademark register must accurately reflect marks that are in use in the united states for the goods and services identified in the registrations for several years the uspto has been working to improve the accuracy and integrity of the trademark register although we have consulted with stakeholders and implemented a number of measures designed to address this issue more can be done there has been a rise in behaviors that undermine the accuracy and reliability of the trademark register as i mentioned in my testimony last year uspto has faced a surge of foreign applications during the last few years particularly from china in some cases with inaccurate or possibly fraudulent claims of use of the mark for the goods or services specified in the application many of these applicants appear to be filing these questionable applications on the advice or with the assistance of foreign individuals and entities who are not authorized to practice law in the u s and therefore should not be representing trademark applicants before the uspto steps taken to address the rise in fake specimens include piloting software to help determine if a photograph submitted as a specimen of use has been digitally altered and actively encouraging lawyers to report suspicious specimens for pending applications to highlight the significance of use statements to those who sign application and post registration declarations the uspto has improved the readability of the declarations and required the statements in them to be acknowledged by checking a box next to each one we also have increased the number of post registration maintenance filings we audit and the trademark trial and appeal board is piloting expedited cancellation procedures in cases raising nonuse or abandonment claims to address the unauthorized practice of law the commissioner for trademarks has issued orders excluding a number of apparently chinese citizens from appearing before the uspto in trademark matters and just a few weeks ago the uspto issued a proposed rulemaking to require u s counsel for all foreign domiciled trademark applicants registrants and parties to ttab proceedings if implemented the rule would enable the uspto to more effectively use available mechanisms to enforce foreign applicant compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements in trademark matters 5 additional domestic and international intellectual property policy the uspto plays a leading role in promoting strong and balanced protection and effective enforcement of ip at home and abroad in particular the uspto advise the president through the secretary of commerce on national and certain international intellectual property policy issues and advises federal departments and agencies on matters of intellectual property in the united states and intellectual property protection in other countries among other things the uspto advocates for global ip norms and understandings and conducts technical assistance and capacity building programs for foreign governments and u s stakeholders through our global intellectual property academy gipa see generally 35 u s c 2 b through gipa we conducted about 150 in person training activities serving more than 7 000 individuals including about five thousand foreign government officials some key developments and activities related to international and other non patent or trademark policy issues are as follows patent prosecution highway the patent prosecution highway or pph is a cooperative initiative that facilitates the timely entry of innovative u s products into foreign markets and key trading partners like japan chile and mexico the uspto has led the global efforts to promote the cooperative framework which has benefitted thousands of u s inventors under the initiative an applicant receiving a favorable patent ruling in one office may request that another participating office expedite the examination of a counterpart patent application the pph has allowed u s inventors to expedite examination in foreign ip offices with high patent backlogs like brazil the timely determinations facilitated by the pph provide greater legal certainty to american businesses and inventors across various international markets technical assistance to support trade negotiations other trade initiatives currently the united states has free trade agreements in force with twenty countries and the uspto provided expert technical advice and support on ip protection and enforcement in connection with the negotiations of all these agreements the uspto provides support in relation to implementation of the ip provisions of these agreements most recently the uspto assisted the u s trade representative ustr in developing the ip chapter of the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca signed by the president in 2018 the usmca currently awaits ratification by congress the uspto is proud of its ongoing role supporting the development and implementation of ip provisions of the u s trade agreements and in ensuring strong and effective protection and enforcement of ip rights critical to driving innovation creating economic growth and supporting american jobs the uspto also works closely with ustr and the department of commerce to provide support for other bilateral and multilateral trade initiatives including the annual special 301 report and various trade and investment framework agreements tifas with our global trading partners protection of industrial designs abroad industrial design protection has become considerably more important in recent years fueled by growing needs of innovators not only to create new products but also to differentiate them from competitors and in an increasingly interconnected world to improve user experiences the uspto has led international efforts to ensure designers are able to protect their product designs in a cost effective manner in key global markets through its work at the id5 industrial design forum an incubator for sharing best practices among the five largest design offices from the china european union republic of korea japan and the united states copyright policy the uspto also advises the administration and the president on international and domestic copyright policy issues the uspto also provided technical assistance during the past year as the ratification and implementation processes for marrakesh treaty on blind and visually impaired persons and the beijing treaty on audiovisual performances were completed domestically we continue to facilitate public copyright policy discussions and provide technical assistance as needed to congress in connection proposed legislative reforms work in this area during the last year included technical assistance on the music modernization act mma china related activities the china team in the uspto s office of policy and international affairs along with ip attachés on the ground in china brings extensive knowledge of and experience with china s intellectual property ip system along with ip attachés the uspto mission in china has five local attorneys who specialize in chinese ip law rights holders have expressed a range of concerns about the ip landscape in china including bad faith misappropriation of trademarks infringement of patents excessive government involvement in licensing transactions and theft of trade secrets consumers are fearful of counterfeit products that pose health and safety risks many of which originate from china the uspto has responded by presenting a series of china ip roadshows which inform rights holders about the most effective ways of protecting and enforcing their intellectual property in china in 2018 staff visited a wide range of venues including nashville des moines austin and new orleans and plan more of these well received roadshows in 2019 we were pleased to have featured addresses from members of congress and municipal leaders at many of our china ip roadshows and look forward to their continued involvement as we prepare for our roadshows in 2019 ip attaché program the ip attaché program is an important asset that supports the uspto s efforts to promote strong and balanced protection and effective enforcement of ip rights abroad the attachés fundamental role is to provide technical expertise assisting embassy officials and advocate for u s ip policy positions for the benefit of u s stakeholders with governments in the host region educate government officials on ip matters including judges prosecutors patent and trademark examiners customs officials police and policy makers assist u s stakeholders with ip concerns in the host country or region and build grass roots support for u s policy objectives by conducting public awareness programs on intellectual property with embassy teams the uspto currently has thirteen ip attachés serving in the u s and foreign commercial service in ten countries around the world these positions are based in rio de janeiro new delhi beijing guangzhou shanghai bangkok mexico city kuwait city brussels lima geneva and kyiv most of these attachés cover a broader region we are pleased that the ip attachés have proven to be effective advocates for u s intellectual property in overseas markets we pledge to work with interagency partners to ensure their contributions continue to serve and advance american interests progress and potential a profile of women inventors on u s patents on february 11 the uspto released a report titled progress and potential a profile of women inventors on u s patents the report released by the uspto office of the chief economist analyzes the american women named as inventors on u s patents between 1976 and 2016 it shows that women still comprise a small minority of patented inventors and highlights the untapped potential of women to spur innovation in the united states notably the report finds that recent gains in female participation in science and engineering occupations and entrepreneurship are not leading to extensive increases in female inventors earning a patent in 2016 women comprised only 12 percent of inventors named on u s patents broadening the innovation ecosphere to include women and other underrepresented groups is critical to inspiring novel inventions driving economic growth and maintaining america s global competitiveness the uspto has undertaken a proactive approach to encourage women as well as other minority groups to innovate and secure patents to protect their innovations including through its inventor assistance resources hosting an annual women s entrepreneurship symposium supporting pro bono networks around the country and building pro se resources in patents to make navigating the patent process more accessible especially to first time applicants resources such as the uspto s patent and trademark resource center program are located in more than eighty public state and academic libraries many in minority and underserved communities providing a direct link to the community through regular programming virtual offices hours with uspto subject matter experts and librarians trained to assist with ip searching and information the uspto supports dozens of other stem related programs and events to provide basic education to young women about intellectual property such as the girl scout ip patch which is administered to girl scout troops across the nation and camp invention in school districts in every state and many other programs the uspto will continue to advance the national dialogue around this issue and engage with industry academia and other government agencies to drive real change 6 telework to effectively manage its workload while maintaining high quality standards the uspto has adopted workforce strategies where employees stay productive and connected regardless of where they are located the uspto has been a leader within the federal space creating a nation wide workforce and effectively implementing telework strategies the uspto telework program has provided cost savings by reducing the need for additional office space enhancing recruitment and retention fostering greater efficiency in production and management enhancing the resiliency of the uspto during continuity events and providing opportunities for expanded work flexibility telework has also allowed the uspto to more than double the number of employees since 2005 without significantly increasing its real estate footprint in fy 2018 for example based on nearly 6 424 full time teleworkers the uspto avoided more than 49 8 million in rent as a result of its full time telework programs the uspto s telework program has also allowed many of our employees to continue to work during weather related government shutdowns the national academy of public administration found that uspto s telework programs saved the office an average of 7 million per year based on work conducted during closures the 2010 telework enhancement act allowed the uspto to initiate a pilot program the telework enhancement act pilot program teapp which permitted employees to change their duty stations thus relieving them of a regular reporting requirement to uspto headquarters in exchange for an agreement that they would pay their own travel costs for a limited number of mandatory trips back to the uspto campus for training and engagement the uspto currently has approximately 2 800 teapp employees living outside the immediate washington d c metro area in 48 states including puerto rico we are pleased that congress has extended the program until december 1 2020 with this extension the uspto will further test larger volumes of trips at one time the tolerance of employees to pay for travel additional onsite training offerings as well as the maturity of the program as the december 31 2020 deadline approaches the agency will explore all options associated with the future of teapp including how the agency will manage travel as well as the development of internal policies for existing teapp employees 7 uspto regional offices the uspto is actively working to better serve the local innovation economies through its four regional offices in detroit dallas denver and san jose among other things these offices help the uspto recruit and retain a highly qualified workforce of patent examiners and administrative patent judges these offices have made our services more easily accessible to those working outside of our nation s capital the offices also serve as hubs for our ip outreach and education efforts and provide inventors small businesses and entrepreneurs easier access to uspto personnel and resources regional office benefits to the public include walk in services to obtain general ip information work stations for searching patents and trademarks a hearing room to host ptab proceedings and interview rooms to connect applicants to examiners working in the region at headquarters or across the country regional office outreach efforts

on thursday january 31 at the central university of venezuela ucv juan guaidó self proclaimed interim president of venezuela presented a powerpoint on his vision for venezuela plan país la venezuela que viene country plan the venezuela to come this presentation was written according to guaidó himself by unnamed economic experts and national assembly deputies although it is not clear if it has been adopted as official national assembly policy while guaidó s presentation was widely reported in the international media the actual contents of the presentation received very little attention guaidó s plan país as well as the closely associated venezuela energética energized venezuela guaidó s party leader leopoldo lópez s 2017 plan for the nation s hydrocarbons industry lay out guaidó s vision of a healthy and economically sustainable venezuela however upon a closer reading it is clear that guaidó s vision fails to adequately address social and economic inequality a key goal of chavismo in reality juan guaidó s venezuela to come is a venezuela we have seen before one for the elites at the expense of lower socioeconomic sectors and the working class guaidó s presentation begins by outlining the opposition case for venezuela as a failed state providing an account compiled from various sources on the country s economic and social implosion the basic facts of which are by now well known the plan is presented as the antidote to this catastrophic situation blamed squarely on the failed economic system of socialism of the 21st century by destroying the country s productive apparatus arbitrary regulations and controls leading to appropriations which are then corruptly plundered here the key theme of individual effort is introduced as he claims such measures have destroyed the citizen s capacity to stand on their own two feet by punishing anyone who looks to provide for their family in a dignified manner by focusing on three main goals giving state power back to the people economically empowering venezuelans and re establishing democracy guaidó proposes a plan to recover venezuela from the current crisis free market faith with regard to giving state power back to the people guaidó emphasized that democracy and the state should be put at the people s gente service so that society can develop itself freely and with dignity to help promote entrepreneurship competition according to this logic empowering venezuelans to overcome structural poverty is directly tied to a reestablishment of free market principles which will supposedly enable society to organize itself in an autonomous manner to solve its problems guaidó therefore believes that economic prosperity in venezuela can only come about by removing state controls on private property he argues that this return to free market policies will solve venezuela s emergency and will allow venezuelans to reach their full potential therefore reinserting venezuela in the concert of free nations of the world and restoring the country s supposedly lost sovereignty guaidó also outlined a few short term priorities to help achieve these larger goals these are to stabilize the economy attend to the complex humanitarian emergency che reactivate the oil industry assure universal access to quality public services guarantee comprehensive citizen security and generate confidence and judicial security to achieve these aims guaidó stated that venezuela will obtain massive financing from four fundamental sources multilateral finance organizations and countries interested in the restoration of democracy and development in venezuela a profound debt restructuring macro economic and regulatory restructuring to attract international investment and recuperation of illegally sourced wealth guaidó s plan to revitalize the economy will involve anchoring the exchange rate to slow inflation dismantling present systems of state control and regulations recapitalizing the banks and reactivating the capital markets promoting international investment including in public companies and in the provision of public services it will address the humanitarian crisis through effective social protection programs as well as through promoting quality jobs and protection of the family income it will place special attention on health education and nutrition and promote jobs through community entrepreneurship programs increasing the minimum wage and creating a new census of beneficiaries to help identify those who need help while some of these goals don t sound particularly malfeasant in theory the presentation s emphasis on the involvement of the private sector through competitive tendering in the provision of public services is deeply concerning the state will only be responsible for the regulation and strict fulfillment of contracts maintaining the ownership of the assets direct subsidies will be provided initially according to the payment capacity of the different sectors of the population but the aim will be to eventually eliminate all subsidies the oil industry reactivating the oil industry is absolutely central to guaidó s program his government would approve a new hydrocarbons law which will include preserving the property of the nation over the oil fields permitting private capital as majority shareholder in oil projects designing a competitive fiscal regime maximizing production of gas and oil and creating a venezuelan hydrocarbons agency agencia venezolana de hidrocarburos avh to supervise the sector one of the most interesting and innovative aspects of guaidó s proposal relates to the notion of democratizing oil according to his plan drawn from the afore mentioned document venezuela energética each venezuelan citizen over 18 years old will receive direct benefits from the oil through a new assets fund for venezuelans based the document reassuringly states on norway s oil fund one of the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world this entity will have the following essential characteristics direct financing from oil sales that is from royalties taxes on profits and shareholding dividends direct ownership by the people with each venezuelan citizen on becoming 18 years old obtaining a personal account in the fpv with directly owned shares which will grow based on oil and gas sales this personal fund can only be used to finance essential needs i e medical insurance mortgages and education costs and will also be the basis of future pension entitlements according to guaidó the fund will be totally transparent with monthly statements on personal accounts provided to each citizen who will also be able to access a webpage to monitor daily activity of the fund it will also be controlled by an independent board without governmental interference the state or as the authors repeatedly insist the government will be financed by a 50 tax on each citizen s fund thus ensuring it s accountability to citizens it is not clear if this will be in addition to existing taxes on income and wealth or replace them through this fund the venezuela energética document makes clear how the other two objectives of guaidó s plan will be achieved the diversification of the economy and the transition to renewable energy the fpv will finance the development of new industries and a robust service sector including hundreds of small businesses again citing norway as an example despite the fact that norway rarely uses its oil fund for these purposes similarly while most of the oil would be exported these sales would finance the development of venezuela s hydroelectric solar and wind energy sources the document however is not clear what mechanisms it will use to achieve these goals the plan closes with two other key promises first comprehensive citizen security via the implementation of a new citizen security strategy which while vague on details promises a thorough structural reform of the public ministry and the national forensic and technical police cicpc including recruiting 120 000 well trained and equipped police additionally the plan promises international cooperation alliances increased preventative policing some form of citizen participation in policing better illuminated streets and renovated and new built prisons notably there is no timeline or financing details provided for these measures which seems to contradict guaidó s promise to reduce the role of the state he also promises a profound review of the justice system including doubling the number of judges in the first year who would be competitively selected and trained in a proposed new school for the judiciary other notable proposals are eliminating indefinite elections of public representatives a key measure introduced by referendum in 2009 combatting corruption among other measures including decentralizing individual states by increasing their powers at the local level while limiting those at the national level overall the plan aims to empower venezuelans to stand on their own two feet and guaidó argues that this can be achieved only with necessary financial support provided under the full rule of law which will thereby liberate the productive forces of the nation a country without a social policy in a previous article in 2014 i identified the preference of opposition parties for private sector activity over state activity both in the economy and in terms of poverty reduction as julio borges the now exiled leader of conservative party primero justicia justice first explained to me in an interview in february 2012 state led social provision aims at maintaining citizen dependence on the state whereas his preferred social policy is that the country does not need a social policy in other interviews conducted at that time with a variety of political and social actors linked to the venezuelan opposition there was a lack of concern for inequality be this socio economic racial or gender inequalities indeed many opposition linked actors i interviewed viewed this concern as more of a discursive strategy employed by chavismo to maintain its power rather than actual empirical social phenomena the current opposition proposals in plan país and venezuela energética continue to reflect these biases plan país is quite clear that the eventual aim in social provision is to eliminate it entirely by privatizing it the state will maintain ownership of assets and infrastructure but service provision itself will be entirely privatized and marketized despite references to universality these services will not be universal in the sense of equal access to all regardless of income as the document suggests that those deemed able will have to pay moreover health and education services will also be financed by the individualized income from the fpv assets fund a similar fate awaits pdvsa the state oil giant which would remain in state hands but be operated by private investors and removed from direct state management to that of an independent board the selection and composition of which remains unclear both documents are characterized by a negative attachment to the state with a preference for terms such as government additionally they shun the concept of collectivity with the people pueblo replaced by the much more general and less political people gente politics and the state therefore are demonized in favor of private individualized initiative which is depicted as the true nature of the venezuelan people and most perfectly expressed by the market this vision is reflected in the fpv assets fund whereby state oil reserves will be transformed into personalized accounts similar to bank accounts and funds allocated with no account taken for social racial or gender inequality the dividends for these are to be used to individually consume privatized essential services which are as is government subjected to a demand led consumer oriented model of citizen control the comparison with norway here is instructive norway is generally viewed as being one of the most equal countries in the world due in large part to a mix of universal welfare state access strong progressive taxation regimes and fair equitable employment regulations the norwegian oil fund then exists in the context of high levels of social equality brought about by a strong state moreover as noted norway does not provide citizens with individualized payments and investment from the fund in state spending is limited to around 4 per annum the venezuela of old the venezuela of juan guaidó s proposed plan país will by no means be a welfare state while the plan mentions consensual salary and labor regulations along international labor organization lines there is no mention of progressive taxation policies or tax policy at all for that matter one of the main aims of the country plan is to reduce and weaken the state rather than as in norway maintain its strength hence the fpv asset fund will most probably not reduce inequality and indeed may increase it as each citizen will be allocated an equal amount regardless of income in the context of a weak or almost non existent commitment to reducing inequality of any type rich venezuelans could conceivably use their fpv dividends to pay for expensive medical care or education services in the united states whereas the poor could not reinforcing existing class and other inequalities the plan then has little in common with the norwegian model and indeed seems its opposite moreover with the promise to immediately involve the imf and other international financial institutions in debt restructuring the opposition is further increasing the likelihood of exacerbating inequality as recent imf involvement in argentina shows in conclusion there is little in these proposals for poor venezuelans the venezuela to come looks conspicuously like the pre chávez unequal elite led venezuela of old

form 10 q as well as our various other sec filings additionally information on any non gaap financial measures referenced in today s call including a reconciliation of those measures to gaap measures maybe found in our sec filings and in the detailed earnings release available on our website please refer to our detailed earnings release for more discussion of our financial condition and results of operations joining me today is our chief financial officer mark ruh in a moment mark will present our financial results but first i would like to give an update on our results of operations and review our progress in executing our business strategy notwithstanding the impact of a challenging period in the mortgage banking cycle i m proud of what we accomplished in 2018 our commercial and consumer banking segment achieved record net income for the year driven primarily by a 12 increase in loans held for investment all of which was from organic growth this growth was broad based in all of our primary commercial and consumer segment business lines of note commercial and industrial lending portfolio grew 16 reflecting the substantial investments we ve made in this line of business overall loan growth drove an increase in our net interest income during the year despite a decline in our net interest margin the yield curve ended the year flatter than previous quarters december 2018 marked both the lowest spread between the two year treasury and the 10 year treasury and the first time the yield curve was inverted along parts of the term structure since 2007 during the fourth quarter our loan portfolio grew only 1 which was less than our expectation of 2 to 4 growth the lower growth was due to the sale of approximately 70 million of single family loans in the quarter for the year loans held for investment grew 12 this interest rate environment and increasing competition for deposits continues to pressure our net interest margin after several quarters of short term interest rate increases by the federal reserve without a similar upwards movement in long term rates our cost of funds has increased at a faster rate than the yield on our assets additionally we experienced outflows of demand deposits by some of our commercial clients associated with the mortgage industry as seasonal servicing deposit remittances which we replaced with higher cost wholesale deposits and borrowing for the year deposits grew 6 lower than our expectations going into the year reflecting a more competitive deposit market notwithstanding a seasonal industrywide competitive pressure our de novo branches those opened five years or less grew deposit balances by 6 8 during the quarter and 30 during the year during the year we opened three new retail deposit branches all in washington we also consolidated two smaller branches in eastern washington into nearby branches lastly we announced our agreement to acquire a retail deposit branch including approximately 123 million of both deposits and commercial loans and a commercial lending team in san diego county we expect that transaction to close in march of this year after the quarter we opened retail deposit branches in san jose and santa clara california these are our first deposit branches in northern california and these branches will both open new markets for us but also will allow us to better serve existing commercial and consuming customers in northern california asset the quality remained strong during the quarter with our non performing asset ratio ending at 17 basis points of total assets our early warning credit indicators continued to reflect strong fundamentals in all of our markets we are keeping a careful eye on some of the secondary smaller markets on our footprint since these markets have historically exhibited a rare price volatility compared to primary markets during the downturn however job creation unemployment commercial and residential development activity and absorption vacancies cap rates and all other leading indicators of economic activity continue to reflect strong fundamentals while lower commission expenses on lower loan origination volume was the primary reason for the reduction in our non interest expense during 2018 our cost savings initiatives in 2017 and 2018 have also materially reduced these expenses as a result of these thoughtful operational changes base salaries occupancy and g a expenses are all meaningfully lower we reduced total headcount to 16 during the year and single family home loan centers including satellite locations decrease from 70 to 53 we believe that these cost savings initiatives will position the company for improved efficiency and profitability additionally while we expect our mortgage banking business profitability to improve as the mortgage cycle improves while we wait for this part of the cycle to end we are considering additional operational and strategic changes to further improve the profitability of the mortgage business during 2018 we sold 4 9 billion in unpaid principal balance of single family mortgage servicing rights and modified our loss sharing agreement with fannie mae related to our dus service both of these strategies improved our regulatory capital ratios also during the year we continued to refresh our board of directors by appointing mark patterson and sandra cavanaugh to the board adding valuable skill sets and perspective to our board since joining the board they have both made valuable contributions toward improved governance and our strategic objectives don voss who joined the board with our acquisition of simplicity bank was named the lead independent director since last proxy season we have held productive discussions regarding corporate governance business strategy and our results with most of our significant shareholders these discussions have given the management and the board meaningful insight on shareholder views on these subjects and positioned us well for the coming proxy season finally a few comments on the recent events and their effect on us many of you may remember the devastating wildfires that impacted parts of california during the fourth quarter with thousands of homes lost in the fire affected areas we have not seen a material impact to homestreet borrowers as all had adequate insurance in place for our borrowers who were affected many have paid off their loans in full with insurance proceeds while a few were taking out construction loans to rebuild additionally homestreet has less than 30 borrowers that are experiencing some financial distress due to their places of employment being affected by the fires we re not seeing any material uptick in single family mortgage delinquencies and we will continue to work with effective borrowers or monitoring the situation additionally we are keeping a careful watch on the effects of the ongoing federal government shutdown on our business we are receiving inquiries from furloughed federal workers about possible single family mortgage forbearance but today only four borrowers to apply for this loss mitigation the rest are using accumulated savings for the time being we stand ready to provide assistance in the form of late fee waivers loan modifications and short term loans where warranted the most acute impact however is on our sba lending business as part of the shutdown the sba is not issuing low numbers so loans cannot be closed or funded the secondary market for sba loan guarantee sales are also closed so loan sales will not recommence until after the government reopens other adverse effects may emerge as the shutdown persists and now i ll turn it over to mark who will share the details of our financial results mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer thank you mark good morning everyone and thank you again for joining us i will first talk about our consolidated results and then provide detail on our two operating segments regarding our operating results net income for the fourth quarter of 18 was 15 2 million or 0 56 per diluted share compared to 11 8 million or 0 44 per diluted share for the third quarter one time items includes the net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 or a non core net recovery of 622 000 of restructuring and acquisition related items net of tax and a non core 4 9 million income tax benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability position related to the tax cuts and jobs act legislation enacted in december december 17 recognized in relation to the filing of our 2017 federal tax return excluding the impact of these charges core net income for the fourth quarter was 9 7 million or 0 36 per diluted share compared to core net income of 12 3 million or 0 45 per diluted share for the third quarter the decrease in core net income from the prior quarter was primarily due to lower non interest income largely from seasonally lower net gain on loan origination and sale activities in our mortgage banking segment net interest income decreased by 272 000 to 51 4 million in the fourth quarter from 51 6 million in the third quarter this decrease in net interest income is primarily due to our slightly compressing net interest margin of 3 19 which decreased 1 basis point in the third quarter s net interest margin of 3 20 while our retail deposit bases have remained relatively low our wholesale deposit and borrowing cost have continued to increase as the federal reserve continued to increase short term interest rates during the quarter this increase in funding costs was partially offset by higher yields on our interest earning assets non interest expense excluding the net impact of acquisition and restructuring related items decreased to 85 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 94 1 million in the third quarter this decrease in non interest expense was primarily from lower commissioning costs on lower closed single family mortgage loan volume but also due expense to expense reduction initiatives total non interest expense declined by 49 1 million or 11 2 for the year ended december 31 18 compared to the year ended december 31 17 the primary driver for this reduction was lower incentives and commission expenses due to lower mortgage loan volume however as a result of our 2017 and 2018 expense reduction initiatives we achieved on a core basis a 14 million or 8 8 decrease in base salary for the year ended december 31 18 compared to the year ended december 31 17 due to the overall reduction in our headcount our expense reduction initiative also reduced the general and administrative expenses on a core basis by 11 3 million or 70 during 2018 finally we reduced occupancy expense on a core basis by 2 6 million or 7 5 during 2018 due in part to reducing our total office count from 138 to 123 during the year these expense reductions were partially offset by increases in information services expense as we continue to invest in upgrading our technology platform our effective income tax benefits rate of negative 2 5 for the fourth quarter of 2018 differs from our combined federal and blended state statutory tax rate of 23 6 primarily due to a tax benefit of 3 7 million comprised of a non core 4 9 million benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability position related to the tax cuts and jobs act and a core expense of 1 2 million related to the filing of our 2017 federal tax return i ll now discuss some key points from our commercial and consumer banking segment results commercial and consumer banking segments core net income was 14 3 million in the fourth quarter a decrease of 2 3 million from core net income 16 6 million in the third quarter the decrease in core income was primarily due to the previously mentioned tax benefit related to the filing of our 2017 federal tax return net interest income increased 1 million from the third quarter of 2018 to 48 9 million primarily due to the growth in our loan held for investments our portfolio of loan held for investments in this segment increased by 47 9 million or 1 during the fourth quarter growth occurred throughout the portfolio with the exception of a decline in the single family mortgage portfolio from the previously mentioned sales of single family mortgage loans during the quarter segment noninterest income decreased quarter to quarter to 10 4 million from 10 7 million this decrease with primarily do slightly lower profit margin from our sales of multifamily fannie mae dus loans and small balance commercial real estate loans during the quarter segment core non interest expense was 38 3 million an increase of 518 000 from the third quarter of a 18 this increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs as we added headcount ahead of two northern california retail deposit branches that were opened in early january of 19 non performing assets increased to 12 1 million or 17 basis points of assets at december 31st compared to 15 basis points of assets at september 30th we recorded a 500 000 provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter compared to 750 000 in the third quarter the decrease in provision was primarily due to a 559 000 due to a 559 000 of net recovery during the fourth quarter compared to net recovery of 122 000 during the third quarter deposit balances were 5 1 billion at december 31st a decrease of 103 6 million from september 30th i ll now share some key points from our mortgage banking segment results the mortgage banking segment s core net loss in the fourth quarter was 4 5 million compared to core net loss of 4 3 million in the third quarter compared to last quarter we had seasonally lower interest rate loss commitment that resulted in decrease in gain on loan origination and sale activity and lower mortgage banking servicing income offset some of our lower core non interest expense when single family interest rate locks are less than closings in a given quarter earnings are negatively affected as the majority of mortgage revenue is recognized at interest rate locks while majority of originating costs including commissions are recognized upon closing accordingly the larger balance between interest rate lock volume and close loan volume during the third quarter normalized during the fourth quarter resulting in lower differential between gain on loan origination sale revenue and salaries and commissions expense our gain on mortgage loan origination and sales composite margin was 323 basis points a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter primarily due to an increase in higher profit margin refinance and fha and va transactions in our origination mix mortgage banking segment core non interest expense of 47 1 million decreased 9 2 million from the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to the decrease in commissions paid as a result of lower closed mortgage loan volume single family mortgage servicing income was 5 4 million in the fourth quarter a decrease from 6 9 million in the third quarter this decrease was primarily due to lower risk management results partially offset by higher servicing income lower risk management results were primarily driven by a more volatile interest rate environment the continued flattening of the yield curve and increased negative convexity costs the increase in servicing income is related to a higher average balance of loans serviced for others our portfolio of single family loan serviced for others increased to 20 2 million of unpaid principal balances at december 31st compared to 19 8 million at september 30th the value of our mortgage servicing rights relative to the balance of loans serviced for others was 125 basis points at quarter end a decrease of 8 basis points compared to prior quarter end thanks for your attention and i ll turn it back over to mark mason mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thank you mark during the past year we ve made substantial changes in our mortgage banking business to improve profitability in response to the current market conditions as i stated earlier we continue to consider both operational and strategic changes to improve further the profitability of this business we are providing guidance today assuming that we will continue with our current operations and strategy and that there are no material changes to the interest rate environment that existed in december 31 2018 current staffing levels mortgage production volume is forecast by the mba or original outlook for mortgage production may impact these numbers actual results may vary from the guidance we are giving today possibly in material ways if our actual strategy or future operations differ from these assumptions we anticipate single family and mortgage loan lock and forward sale commitment volume of 1 2 billion and 1 5 billion in the first and second quarters of this year respectively we anticipate mortgage held for sale closing volumes of 1 1 billion and 1 6 billion for the same periods for the full year of 2019 we anticipate single family mortgage loan lock in and forward sale commitments to total 5 2 billion and loan closing volume to total 5 3 billion we expect our mortgage composite profit margins to remain in the range of between 310 and 320 basis points during the next two quarters as well as for the full year of 2019 in our commercial and consumer banking segment we expect our quarterly loan portfolio growth to average between 2 and 4 throughout this year reflecting the yield curve as of the end of the fourth quarter and absent changes in market rates and loan prepayment speeds we expect our consolidated net interest margin to decrease to the range of 300 basis points to 310 basis points over the next two quarters and remain within that range throughout this year during the first and second quarters of this year we expect our total core non interest expense to increase approximately 6 to 8 given seasonally increasing closed single family mortgage loan expectations for the full year of 2019 we expect our average quarterly net change in total core non interest expenses to increase by approximately 3 reflecting the growth of the business overall total core non interest expenses will vary quarter to quarter driven by seasonality and cyclicality in both our single family and commercial real estate closed mortgage loan volume this concludes our prepared comments thank you for your attention today mark and i would be happy to answer any questions you have at this time questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from jeff rulis of d a davidson please go ahead jeff rulis d a davidson analyst all right thanks good morning mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president good morning jeff rulis d a davidson analyst first question is more on the expense side just wanted to see if the restructuring noise either expenses or recovers as we saw this quarter is that largely complete at this point there s no tailwind into 2019 is that what you expect mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president yes with respect to the expense restructurings in the mortgage business that were announced in the earlier in the year and this quarter we had a fair amount of revenue noise or contra expense noise related to income taxes we don t expect to repeat any of that going forward jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay and then the just on the msr side any i guess any thoughts on additional sales and then on a related just kind of the mortgage servicing line item from a revenue basis any expectations in 2019 mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president we do not have any planned sales of mortgage servicing at this time i can t rule it out because we have since the company has been public on two occasions sold servicing primarily for capital planning purposes but we don t have any plan at this time mortgage loan servicing revenue has been challenged over the last two years in particular as the yield curve flattened and you can see that the company s risk management results have declined during that time historically the company has had very strong servicing revenue associated not just with the growth of the servicing portfolio but with the results of risk management which is really hedging and typically the hedging income has been substantial but as the yield curve has flattened the earnings on the swaps portion of that hedge which is the lion share at times 75 of the hedge position those earnings have declined substantially and so we expect that servicing income will be muted despite slow servicing speeds until we have a lift in the yield curve jeff rulis d a davidson analyst great and maybe last one on the just on the npa the modest lift in what consumer and commercial any color on those i assume not systemic issues wasn t large but any additional detail on the increase mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president there s nothing noteworthy there there is probably a little volatility given how low the numbers are jeff rulis d a davidson analyst fair enough okay thank you mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks jeff operator the next question comes from steve moss of b riley fbr please go ahead steve moss b riley fbr analyst good morning mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president good morning steve moss b riley fbr analyst wondering just go on the locked volume guide of 5 2 billion for 2019 obviously a bit lower from what it was before just wondering what are the drivers behind that versus expectations before mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well recently we ve seen anecdotally in our markets and specifically in most recent data home sales volume decline and while this last quarter and currently as long rates declined a little bit we ve seen some resurgence in refinancing we can t expect that to continue either and so based upon those changes we have lowered our expectations a little bit steve moss b riley fbr analyst okay and then on the margin guide here going to 3 to 3 10 in the upcoming quarters just wondering is it primarily expect driven by funding costs here mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president yes or just the dividend speeds right funding costs rising faster than asset yield asset yields are still rising and to the extent that we see moderation in deposit betas that would be better but conservatively we thought that we needed to lower the expectation range steve moss b riley fbr analyst okay and then i guess my third question i m not sure if i heard you correctly mark but was at 2 to 4 loan growth per quarter or for the full year mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer that s still per quarter obviously we didn t make it last quarter but that was in part due to a sale of single family loans right we would have made that range had we not elected to sell some single family mortgages on to the portfolio steve moss b riley fbr analyst all right thank you very much mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks steve operator the next question comes from jackie bohlen of kbw please go ahead jackie bohlen kbw analyst hi good morning everyone mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president good morning jackie jackie bohlen kbw analyst wanted to touch based on expenses and looking primarily to headcount and any anticipated de novo branches plans you might have in the year and understanding of course that there are no announced plans for the mortgage banking segment but there the possibility exists mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president in terms of de novo branches we opened two in january that had been delayed for some period of time at this time we are not planning any additional de novo branches for the foreseeable future so headcount increases associated with the branch network system will define substantially from prior years right in terms of the mortgage business we have had some attrition as a consequence of low volumes and as a performance related issue we may have additional attrition if volume continues to decline as the market is suggesting right now so that affects both of course reduction in positions but also the operational positions depending upon total loan volume jackie bohlen kbw analyst and have you been replacing any of the attrition or just absorbing it with those that you have mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well we tried to replace attrition in production personnel with people with higher volume in today s market conditions that s the day in day out part of the business we will attempt to replace attrition so that we keep seats filled in the offices that we have today if there are empty seats the office will not be operating as efficiently as it could or should so we will be attempting to replace attrition of folks that are not been able to generate volume with those who do jackie bohlen kbw analyst okay so it sounds like then for the overall company the headcount could come up a little bit in 2019 outside of any additional announcements mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president very slightly we have we entered the year with some open positions at various places in the company but our expectations are that the total headcount not increase materially this year jackie bohlen kbw analyst okay and then given all the tax noise in the quarter would you mind just providing us with an updated guidance for an anticipated range going forward in terms of the tax rate mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer yes jackie yes sure i would use our estimated to for you again 20 5 i believe at the prior quarter we provided 21 but i would stick with 20 5 going forward jackie bohlen kbw analyst okay and the b o should normalize next quarter mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer that was one time event you wouldn t see that again and so b o will normalize which does not run through the tax line number that run through the g a line that threshold jackie bohlen kbw analyst yes mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer yes right got it jackie bohlen kbw analyst yes definitely understood okay great thanks guys mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks jackie operator the next question comes from tim o brien of sandler o neill and partners please go ahead tim o brien sandler o neill analyst good morning guys mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president hey tim tim o brien sandler o neill analyst a quick question for mark ruh do you happen to have the dollar amount of sba gain on sale income for the quarter for 4q mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer we provide the dollar amount i m looking at 484 000 tim o brien sandler o neill analyst okay mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer it s in the table that s where i looking at it s in page 12 for a table of commercial and consumer banking segment 484 000 tim o brien sandler o neill analyst sorry i missed that i looked but i missed it but thank you for that and then another question i have for you with the government shutdown possibly extending could that affect your single family mortgage business in any way shape or form mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer so far not materially there s a couple of government related loan programs that have issues like tim o brien sandler o neill analyst like da program mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer there s a usda program and a department of homelands program that we do through fha that have both been shut down for a moment but they re not a material part of the originations tim o brien sandler o neill analyst okay and same thing on the multi side right not expected the impact the shutdown is not going to impact your multi sale business mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president fannie mae continues to operate right so fannie mae does business should be unaffected and the private business is not affected tim o brien sandler o neill analyst great and then you alluded to qualitatively some thoughts there might be some additional strategic changes that get looked at by the board this year mark could you talk a little bit about kind of the list of what some of those changes that might be considered could be any of them mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president you know we tim o brien sandler o neill analyst i put you on the spot there a little bit but mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well i want to give you a quality answer but the range of things that we look at is really why right i mean why as you might consider and so i don t want to overemphasize any particular option because that would suggest something that we are committed to doing and we re not yet but we continue to analyze ways to improve profitability of the size of our business the product lines within the business expense components there is a very tough time and while we have a deep and long history in the mortgage business status quo is not acceptable it s not acceptable to us it s not acceptable to our shareholders and you should expect us to go after fully analyzing additional changes make some changes that make a meaningful difference in the business tim o brien sandler o neill analyst so i guess looking into that the reverse of that are there any critical core parts of the business that you guys you can say right now that you remain committed to that probably won t see any meaningful material strategic adjustments around mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president that s kind of a tough question to answer because it s a very integrated business right and i think i ll just leave my comments where they are right now tim o brien sandler o neill analyst you re pretty open minded mark mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well we have to be right we have a responsibility here we have a lot of capital tied up in this business our shareholders capital my capital everybody s capital and we have been while we ve been active in trying to seek improved profitability we have been patient in believing that the cycle will turn and return superior profitability is taking a long time and while it s probably easier for us to be patient because we ve been through cycles there it s less easy for people who aren t as familiar and so we re doing a lot of work on analyzing the business today and that s all i am prepared to say tim o brien sandler o neill analyst hey guys thanks for the earnings call and for answering my questions and good luck in the new year mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks tim operator operator instructions the next question comes from tim coffey of fig partners please go ahead tim coffey fig partners analyst thank you good morning everybody mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president hey tim tim coffey fig partners analyst hey mark i was wondering can you provide little more detail on the residential mortgage loans that you ve sold out of the held for investment bucket mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president we took the opportunity to strip out a portion of that portfolio with an eye to one reducing the size a little but two trying to sell some lower coupon loans while the market rates were lower to improve the yields going forward tim coffey fig partners analyst okay and you have a outlook mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president i m sorry and in part responding to people inquiring of us whether we d be interested in selling a portion of the portfolio tim coffey fig partners analyst okay do you have other loans in the portfolio that kind of fit the characteristics of the loans that you sold mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well theoretically we always do it right if you think about originating continuously tim coffey fig partners analyst okay and then on the kind of commercial real estate loans sold in the quarter last couple of quarters you ve sold more than you ve originated given what we re seeing in the sba market and the trends that you ve shown in that cre non dust bucket could we see more loans being sold going forward than you originate and of course the portfolio you have of cre loans anyway is growing is that something we could see going forward mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well i think if you look at the full year last year was very seasonal in the first part of the year we originated more than we sold second part of the year we sold more than we originated i can t tell you exactly what the pattern is typically it s in part demand based right and demand grows in the second half of the year historically so that pattern great origination and sale of the first half greater the sale and origination in the second half is driven impart large part probably by a purchaser demand so i can t tell you exactly what the pattern will be but it will not surprise me if it s the same this year tim coffey fig partners analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then earlier in the q a you said that you re not expecting a resurgence in refi i m kind of wondering what you would need to see from the market to give you that indication that refi is picking up mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well it s picked up a little bit right if you look at the composition of lending and if you saw the december numbers and to extend january today the percentage of the composition of refi versus purchase has increased the dollar amount of that lending is still relatively weak right if you think about the lower levels seasonally i think it s important to remember that during the recession and the years following the recession as rates fell the industry refinanced a substantial amount of the mortgages in the united states and the average interest rate in the servicing portfolios across the united states is approximately the current rate and so the number of loans with a sufficient economic interest in refinancing is much smaller than in prior cycles at this time and so that s why i based my comments on tim coffey fig partners analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then the deposit cost trends i guess on total deposits we ve seen right around say 10 basis points increase every quarter throughout 2018 are you seeing that the trends are likely to be about the same or slowing mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well everybody s portfolio is different right and their needs are different we i believe deposit costs are going to continue to increase at least our line of sight right and then if i can say was 10 too far but that s our view here that the pace is not going to change in the near term tim coffey fig partners analyst okay and then this one follow on on the san diego branch that you acquired i mean are going to close on in march it s effectively kind of a small bank good loans good deposits but one of the seasoned banker that i know of can you kind of talk about how that branch fits into the hierarchy of your southern california footprint mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president sure this was a particularly good deal for us because we do not currently have a commercial lending team in san diego we currently have four branches there primarily consumer branches though we have some growing commercial business there but it s being served or serviced out of orange county and so being able to have an in market team a well known track record bankers is real boost to our business and we re looking forward to great things for that group after they join us tim coffey fig partners analyst and your loan growth kind of guidance for next question that was organic right that didn t include this branch mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president loan growth for this year that has historically has been an inorganic forecast of ours yes tim coffey fig partners analyst okay yes i was just double checking all right thank you very much those are my questions mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks tim operator and we have a follow up from jeff rulis of d a davidson please go ahead jeff rulis d a davidson analyst hey mark i just forgot or i didn t quite get the numbers down on the guidance i got the lock and closed for 2019 for the full year at 5 2 and 5 3 could you repeat the q1 and q2 lock and closed mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president sure it s locks are 1 2 billion and 1 5 billion for q1 and q2 and closings 1 1 billion and 1 6 billion jeff rulis d a davidson analyst great that was it thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mark mason

excited about the significant long term opportunities at etame and we will look to repeat similar drilling programs multiple times and continue adding reserves and production for many years to come we are poised financially and operationally to deliver profitable growth and add meaningful value for our shareholders gabon psc extension on september 25 2018 vaalco together with the other joint owners in the etame main block the consortium received an implementing presidential decree from the government of gabon authorizing the psc extension the psc extension extends the period for the three

exploitation areas in the etame marin block would begin expiring in june 2021 the psc extension also grants the consortium the right for two additional extension periods of five years each the psc

guinea equatorial gepetrol will act as the administrative operator under the terms of lifting of the suspension by march 28 2019 a new joint owner must assume gepetrol s working interest obligations if the joint owner is approved vaalco intends to seek a partner on a promoted basis that will cover all or substantially all of the cost to drill an exploratory well required by the agreement while there is no monetary penalty for failing to meet the terms of the lifting of the suspension vaalco would lose its interest in the license and the associated costs would become impaired as of december

budgeting for development and exploration activities under a development and production area in the block including the approval of a development and production plan the production sharing contract

totaled 3 717 bopd compared with 3 957 bopd in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 4 120 bopd in the third quarter of 2018 the fourth quarter of 2018 was impacted primarily by a two day field wide shutdown

financial measure pv 10 and probable reserves pv 10 is a non gaap financial measure and represents the period end present value of estimated future cash inflows from vaalco s reserves less future development and production costs discounted at 10 per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using sec pricing assumptions in effect at the end of the period pv 10 generally differs from standardized measure the most directly comparable gaap financial measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes pv 10 is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties vaalco s pv 10 is the same as its standardized measure for the periods presented herein neither pv 10 nor the standardized measure purports to represent the fair value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves vaalco has provided summations of its proved and probable reserves and summations of its pv 10 for its proved and probable reserves in this press release the sec strictly prohibits companies from aggregating proved probable and possible reserves in filings with the sec due to the different levels of certainty associated with each reserve category gaap does not provide a measure of estimated future net cash flows for reserves other than proved reserves investors should be cautioned that estimates of pv 10 of probable reserves as well as the underlying volumetric estimates are inherently more uncertain of being recovered and realized than comparable measures for proved reserves further because estimates of probable reserve volumes have not been adjusted for risk due to this uncertainty of recovery their summation may be of limited use nonetheless vaalco believes that pv 10 estimates for probable reserves present useful information for investors about the future net cash flows of its reserves in the absence of a comparable gaap measure such as standardized measure investor contact phil patman 713 623 0801 vaalco energy inc and subsidiaries consolidated balance sheets

there is a certain trend of opinion amongst the liberal left particularly in the us which never felt very comfortable with the bolivarian revolution now in the midst of a serious and well organised attempt by washington to remove maduro s government they insist on equally blaming both sides for the crisis one which in their view can be resolved through negotiations between the government and the opposition a chief representative of this point of view is gabriel hetland who has written several articles on venezuela for the nation jacobin and other left wing publications his latest article venezuela s deadly blackout highlights the need for a negotiated resolution of the crisis sums up this argument neatly so it is useful to analyse it in some detail the article is full of inaccuracies and half truths but its main flaw is a mistaken analysis of the situation in venezuela one that avoids a class approach to the different forces involved from which hetland derives a completely utopian solution the devil s in the details let s start with some of the factual inaccuracies the caption of the picture illustrating the articles reads people collect water from a leaking pipeline along the guaire river the same line is then used within the article for effect it is false during the blackout there was lack of water supply as a result people resorted to collecting water from springs coming down the avila mountain some of these springs are canalised and then end up in the guaire river people were collecting water from two such springs on the side of the guaire not from a leaking pipe water pipes were actually not carrying water this might seem like a small detail but it has a certain importance the headlines in many of the newspapers claimed people were collecting water from the guaire river itself which is extremely polluted el nuevo herald in miami said desperate venezuelans collect rotten water in the midst of blackout the mass media exaggerates and sometimes publishes straight lies in order to fit into a narrative of harrowing crisis in venezuela in order to justify the need for foreign intervention or in any case regime change hetland is not new to this business and should know he needs to check all the details he uses in his story another one in the opening paragraph of his article hetland seeks to draw attention to how bad and long lasting the blackout was he does mention how power was intermittently restored on sunday and monday in parts of caracas and elsewhere but then ends the paragraph with a mention of the new york times headline with the new york times on monday publishing an article titled no end in sight to venezuela s blackout experts warn what s the conclusion he wants the reader to draw that the blackout is far from over in fact we don t know when power will be restored at all there is just a small detail it does not coincide with the facts by midnight 11 march power had been restored in merida zulia and táchira the last remaining states affected by the blackout hetland s article carries the date of 13 march when the blackout was already over and there were only a few smaller towns left affected in paragraph two hetland states the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals of course the lack of power in hospitals is alarming and very dangerous however all hospitals in the country have their own independent power generators that activate in the event of an emergency a report by the opposition aligned ngo médicos por la salud published on 11 march in the evening a list of all 32 of the country s hospitals with a detailed explanation of their situation in all of them their own power plants were working with the exception of one where it was working intermittently heltand then adds to be blunt people are dying and more will die the longer the blackout continues to back up his assertion he links to a reuters report which quotes from medicos por la salud saying that 17 people have died as a result of problems with electricity supply when you then look at the ngo s own report the picture is less clear in the report about the state of hospitals which i quoted above of the 32 hospitals listed all bar two are marked as no deceased and the other two account for a total of three people dead in a separate report by the same ngo about the number of people who died during the blackout 24 are listed but no details are given as to the causes of death so these could be people who would have died regardless of the blackout again this might seem a small detail but details are important because they are what build a story a story can be constructed in two ways one would say hospitals dealt with the blackout by using their own emergency generators which greatly minimised the dangerous impact of lack of electricity the other says the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals to be blunt people are dying and more will die you are more likely to write the second if you rely largely or solely on material from reuters and other such agencies and you are also more likely to stray from the truth what caused the blackout of course heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given what does he tell us about it he starts by saying there are two competing narratives a word i particularly hate but neither he goes on does justice to venezuela s reality in heltand s opinion the blackout and the broader crisis are not entirely the fault of maduro nor of the united states and the domestic opposition the urgency of the situation demands recognition of shared responsibility for the crisis heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given but he doesn t provide one image telesur but then hetland states that only the most myopic analysis could ignore the government s clear responsibility for the perilous state of venezuela s electric grid and goes on to give as an example the scandal of the tacoma hydro plant a project that was never finished as a result of corruption even here he gets some facts wrong by using a report that is now outdated however the question is how does a non functioning power plant relate to the current blackout everyone government and opposition agrees that something went wrong inside the control centre for the el guri hydro complex the dispute is about what caused the fault the opposition says it was a wildfire under the main high power line out of el guri while the government claims it was a cyber attack affecting the scada system that regulates the plant which produces 80 percent of venezuela s power what is heltand s opinion about this he does not say though he of course mentions the possibility of a cyberattack quoting an article from forbes he does not go into any of the details and his conclusion is clear available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage but by the electric grid being pushed to the brink by years of increased use and a lack of investment and maintenance available evidence perhaps heltand knows more than everyone else because so far neither the government nor the opposition have provided much if any evidence to back up their stories their arguments are mostly based on circumstantial evidence the opposition has not provided any evidence of the mysterious wildfire that they say affected the 765kv power line and then caused the el guri system to shut down which should be relatively simple if such a fire had occurred furthermore guaidó rejected the idea of a cyber attack as he alleged that the el guri hydro complex was controlled analogically something that is a straight lie all of these things are being widely discussed in venezuela with claims and counter claims being made heltand ignores all of this and simply claims that available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage without even mentioning what is this available evidence he bases himself upon or providing any useful links as a reference in fact he has already decided on an explanation that fits his narrative and has written a story that ignores the available evidence just to cover himself after having declared what the cause of the blackout is he adds getting to the bottom of the blackout is important journalists based in venezuela should investigate the possible causes yes mr hetland getting to the bottom of the blackout is important jumpìng to conclusions based on preconceived ideas does not help journalists based in venezuela have already done a very good job of attempting to establish what actually happened and this article in 15 y último is perhaps one of the best efforts it was published on 11 march two days before hetland s article was published in the nation the path of negotiation however the main problem with heltand s article lies in the conclusions he draws calls for military intervention must be rejected one must recognize however the untenability of the status quo the combination of maduro s repressive and inept rule and debilitating us sanctions has brought venezuela to the edge of catastrophe the longer the situation continues the worse things will get yes on one thing we can certainly agree the situation in venezuela is bad and has significantly worsened over the last four or five years but what is the plausible path for resolving venezuela s crisis that he proposes first of all he accepts the premise that a peaceful transition needs to take place and this must be through free and fair elections here we see how our liberal critic in fact accepts all of the premises of regime change on which us imperialism bases its current assault on venezuela washington too says it is for a peaceful transition and above all for free elections in fact this is precisely what nominally they are trying to achieve with their policy of diplomatic pressure sanctions and the threat of military intervention hetland therefore assumes without explaining why that the presidential elections in 2018 were not free and fair and that therefore maduro is an illegitimate president otherwise why should there be new elections when he was just sworn in in january our liberal friend finds himself firmly in the camp of the venezuelan opposition and us imperialism his disagreement with imperialism seems to be just tactical he does not think that this outcome can or should be achieved through sanctions or military action he seems to will the ends but not the means how does he think this can be achieved then the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian and ignores venezuela s recent past in fact over the years there have been many negotiations between the government and the opposition the current attempt by imperialism is not the first already in april 2002 the opposition carried out a us backed coup barely three years into the chavez government when president chavez was returned to power by a mass movement of the poor what did he do he called on the opposition to the negotiating table how did they respond by immediately starting to prepare for another coup this time in the form of the sabotage of the oil industry and a bosses lockout which lasted from december 2002 until february 2003 and nearly crippled the economy the opposition does not want negotiations they want to crush the bolivarian revolution by any means necessary if they think they can achieve this via negotiations they will not object as long as their objectives are guaranteed hetland says the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian image flickr the white house the most recent attempt at negotiations was the 2016 17 talks in the dominican republic brokered amongst others by the former social democratic president of spain zapatero the main demand of the opposition in those talks was precisely free and fair early presidential elections when it seemed that an agreeable compromise had been reached and even a date for the elections had been fixed then the opposition under pressure from bogotá and washington decided to walk out of the talks zapatero was fuming and he advised the government to go ahead with the elections on the agreed date the election in which a section of the opposition led by henri falcon participated did take place maduro won and zapatero who acted as an observer vouched for the process but all of this appears to be a closed book to hetland and who is the government supposed to negotiate with throughout his article and in other writings hetland insists on establishing a difference between radical sectors of the opposition or sectors of the far right opposition and the opposition as a whole in practice on the ground such a difference does not exist the current coup attempt led in venezuela by guaidó is backed by all the opposition parties represented in the national assembly the 2016 violent riots which hetland mentions in his article were also part of a joint and united campaign by the opposition as a whole the bulk of the opposition under pressure from washington boycotted the presidential election and expelled henri falcón from the mud democratic unity roundtable for taking part in it in any case how are these negotiations going to happen the government has said repeatedly that it is prepared to negotiate even with trump but the opposition has rejected any advances hetland suggests that perhaps the eu s international contact group could make this happen this is either naïve or seriously dangerous the main eu countries are completely subordinate to washington s strategy on venezuela it was spanish president sanchez who issued an eight day ultimatum to maduro to call presidential elections he was then joined by france the uk germany and the majority of eu members who went on to recognise guaidó as the legitimate president of venezuela the icg was only created in order to destroy mexico s independent initiative to find a negotiated solution when the icg representatives arrived in montevideo the uruguayan government under pressure abandoned its independent position and left mexico on its own you cannot have half a revolution to add to hetland s mythical unicorn of a democratic opposition he then adds that once the us is removed from the equation how by whom then we can hope hope springs eternal in the liberal breasts for a growth of a much broader opposition movement one in which the voices of the popular classes could have much more weight this is perhaps the crux of the matter the main problem in hetland s approach is the lack of any discussion of the class nature of this conflict the venezuelan opposition and behind it washington represents the interests of the country s oligarchy the rich and wealthy families that have ruled venezuela for over a 100 years and playing a subordinate role to us imperialism their mass base of support is mainly drawn from the middle class and upper middle class areas in the east of caracas and other major cities chavismo has its roots amongst the working class the poor peasants and the urban poor the opposition supporters have an irrational hatred a primal fear of the chavista masses during the violent opposition rioting in 2016 a young man orlando figuera was burnt alive and died as a result his crime being dark skinned and therefore looking both poor and like a chavista certainly in this opposition the voices of the popular classes have no weight for good reason most of the venezuelan poor and the working class have a healthy class instinct and they reject an opposition that they correctly see as representing los amos del valle the age old oligarchy abiding by the interests of imperialism the maduro government s policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution image public domain the maduro government has had a policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class this has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution what progressives need to discuss is the root cause of the crisis in venezuela and on that basis discuss a solution that benefits the country s working people the frightful economic crisis from which venezuela is suffering was triggered in 2014 by the collapse in the price of oil and has been aggravated by some of the government s policy decisions deficit financing paying the foreign debt widespread corruption and us sanctions but its root cause are the well meaning attempts of the bolivarian government to regulate the capitalist economy through price and foreign exchange controls and robust labour and trade union legislation in order to protect the interests of the many this does not work capitalism cannot be regulated if such a thing is attempted capitalists resort to any measures necessary legal or illegal to circumvent such controls establish systems by which they end up benefiting from them foreign currency speculation black marketeering hoarding and generally resort to sabotage investment strikes and capital flight venezuela is a textbook case of this there are therefore only two solutions to the untenable status quo hetland talks about one resolves the crisis in the benefit of the capitalist class and imperialism that is the one advocated by guaidó in his plan país with the backing of the us it involves privatising state owned companies opening up the public sector to private capital and above all opening up the oil industry which is what john bolton demanded this would mean making the poor and workers pay the full price of the crisis that is the opposition s programme and it certainly does not give any weight to the voices of the popular classes the other solution would be based on pursuing genuine revolutionary policies in the benefit of the majority a return to the tasks that chavez announced but left unfinished a socialist economy and a communal state a socialist economy would require the expropriation of the multinationals and the main capitalist groups in venezuela as well as the latifundia in order to create a democratic plan of production under workers control to satisfy the needs of the majority a communal state would imply putting power in the hands of workers committees peasant committees and neighbourhood councils so that the people can rule hetland seems to perceive only a handful of actors in venezuela the us the far right opposition a mythical democratic opposition and the maduro government however there is also a chavista revolutionary movement which is not the same as the government this can be found in the el maizal in organisations like alexis vive in the few remaining experiences of workers control and in the tens of thousands of poor and working class venezuelans who have come out in the last few weeks to oppose imperialist intervention but you will not find it in the pages of the mass media in the us they are in different degrees critical of the maduro government as a whole or at least of some of its worst aspects corruption bureaucracy etc but they know full well that the coming to power of guaidó on the back of an imperialist intervention would be a major disaster what progressives in the us should do is first and foremost oppose the imperialist policies of their government including sanctions and military intervention this should be done not just through writing articles but by organising a mass campaign in the streets and a mass education campaign amongst students and workers that campaign must distance itself from and challenge the main premises that imperialism is using to justify its intervention it does not mean suspending criticism of the maduro government but that criticism should be made from the point of view of the interests of venezuelan workers and peasants not with a view to pleasing liberal academics in the usa of course such a campaign needs to offer an analysis of what has gone wrong in venezuela but that analysis needs to be firmly based on a class perspective not on the utopian idea that eu brokered talks can somehow resolve the conflict between the interests of the venezuelan workers and poor and those of the oligarchy and imperialism

the economy is on the ropes and it will force a change in sa right now we re looking like an eighties rerun and politicians will have to pray at the biggest altar of mass destruction ever interest rates it is a well known fact that government s debt to gdp ratio is going to be around 56 by the end of march 2019 debt from state owned enterprises soes is likely to add another 35 by the end of the month total public debt issued is therefore likely to be 91 5 by end march this is the highest level the total public debt to gdp ratio has ever been the last time south africa had similar debt levels was in the middle of the 1980s and it was very difficult to finance that amount of debt government was on the verge of defaulting and was looking at ways to re enter the world with the then prime minister failing to cross the rubicon in a speech a few quarters later south africa made use of financial experts in switzerland to find money on a daily basis as sanctions hurt sanctions by overseas pension funds and later banks made it more difficult to pay the interest which peaked north of 18 in january 1986 moreover south africa in the 1980s had prescribed assets which meant that 53 of one s pension had to be invested in government and soe bonds this was done so that the government had access to money for the debt repayments it had to make although interest rates rose this did not completely compensate for all the risks such as inflation and a possible default by government the situation got so out of hand that when a person in new york wanted to know what the swiss franc dollar exchange rate was they would phone the then transnet dealers nedbank was at times rumoured to be the biggest swiss franc dollar trader in the world incredible for a relatively small south african bank in the 1980s far away from the public eye however the nats were talking to the anc while others went on senegal safaris namibia gained independence and the sa national defence force withdrew from the then south west africa iscor was en route to being privatised as the socialist nats needed cash although it took another five years before it happened in 1989 lux air brought competition on some european air routes against saa private airline flitestar could operate domestically as saa didn t have the cash for more planes m net was allowed to compete against the sabc and sunday trading started all to get the economy going in 1990 nelson mandela was released and the anc was unbanned by fw de klerk before him however pw botha and the justice minister were already in talks with mandela south africa needed foreign funds and relief from the then lower but still high debt levels as sa had too many power stations it drew investment with very cheap electricity prices never to be seen again it attracted alusaf and other big power users this then brought the cheap power and the money to help pay off the eskom debt at the time while our railways made plans to export coal at a cheaper rate to generate revenue now south africa s total debt burden is about 3 higher as a ratio of gdp and the country is heading to the same repayment concerns as then today it is not financial sanctions but a rating downgrade that will get foreign capital to the local debt market a downgrade due to the high public debt levels and low growth that sa has now reminds one of the 1980s sa s current total debt to gdp ratio means that the country will struggle to finance the debt much like during the 1980s but without the excess electricity to sell and with load shedding which means the economy cannot function at its full potential a downgrade from moody s will increase the yields on bonds as foreign bond index funds and pension funds are forced to withdraw from the sa market much like jp morgan and calpers the california public employees retirement system did in the 1980s like a weapon of mass destruction this will blow up government s ability to borrow more and with tax rates higher than most countries the impact on government s ability to spend will be felt soon government will not be able to afford increases in social grants or the government wage bill and the cohesion that government spending brings will dissipate just like the 1980s the economy will force a change upon south africa there will be selling of assets pragmatic economic decisions and i suspect the socialist and racist rhetoric will almost disappear from government mumblings bill clinton said it s the economy stupid during his election campaign against george bush senior well economic reality is about to make a comeback in sa instead of wanting to know who won the elections south african businesses will want to know what the outcome of the election means for the economy and how the politicians will react to the new economic reality politicians will pray at the biggest altar of mass destruction ever interest rates they will pray for mercy at this altar even if they have no religion or respect for markets expect unions to fight for pension fund returns when prescribed assets in one form or another are implemented our old age is under threat of poverty and relying on a social pension will not be good enough for the majority of south africans expect bumps and turns before a whole host of reforms are packaged and sold as new solutions to very old problems expect some universities to close soes such as saa to disappear and many a government official to look for a new career the road to the future i describe will however be full of twists and turns and one must be careful not to panic save as you never have before or more because when you retire it will be harder diversify as fast and as much as possible but remember that you are now able to do more than before

stated we are very pleased with our overall performance during 2018 our total revenues increased by about 25 when compared to year 2017 at the same time our comprehensive loss went down 45 in 2018 compared to 2017 additionally our 4th quarter 2018 had an increase in our total revenues of 10 compared to the same quarter in 2017 in the second half of q4 2018 the market experienced a strong downward pressure however we are getting some optimistic signals for the future mainly from the supply side of the market we hope the trade war problems will be resolved for the benefit of the entire world economy and by extent for our industry the combination of the trade war brexit chinese new year among other factors repressed the demand which spilled over onto the industry charter rates however the fundamentals have improved slightly recently and with the baltic dry index doing better we are optimistic that the desperately needed rebound of the market isn t too far off fortunately we were able to seize the opportunity and secure some relatively good period charters for some of our vessels before this downward trend started additionally we are pleased to report our recent developments are as follows in october 2018 and following our reverse split effect of october 15 2018 we have regained compliance with nasdaq stock exchange with the price of 1 00 per share minimum

not a recognized measurement under ifrs adjusted ebitda is included herein because it is a basis upon which we assess our financial performance and because we believe that it presents useful information to investors regarding a company s ability to service and or incur indebtedness and it is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under ifrs some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business the following table sets forth a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to total comprehensive loss and

joining me today is our chief financial officer mark ruh in a moment mark will present our financial results but first i would like to give an update on our results of operations and review our progress in executing our business strategy notwithstanding the impact of a challenging period in the mortgage banking cycle i m proud of what we accomplished in 2018 our commercial and consumer banking segment achieved record net income for the year driven primarily by a 12 increase in loans held for investment all of which was from organic growth this growth was broad based in all of our primary commercial and consumer segment business lines of note commercial and industrial lending portfolio grew 16 reflecting the substantial investments we ve made in this line of business overall loan growth drove an increase in our net interest income during the year despite a decline in our net interest margin the yield curve ended the year flatter than previous quarters december 2018 marked both the lowest spread between the two year treasury and the 10 year treasury and the first time the yield curve was inverted along parts of the term structure since 2007 during the fourth quarter our loan portfolio grew only 1 which was less than our expectation of 2 to 4 growth the lower growth was due to the sale of approximately 70 million of single family loans in the quarter for the year loans held for investment grew 12 this interest rate environment and increasing competition for deposits continues to pressure our net interest margin after several quarters of short term interest rate increases by the federal reserve without a similar upwards movement in long term rates our cost of funds has increased at a faster rate than the yield on our assets additionally we experienced outflows of demand deposits by some of our commercial clients associated with the mortgage industry as seasonal servicing deposit remittances which we replaced with higher cost wholesale deposits and borrowing for the year deposits grew 6 lower than our expectations going into the year reflecting a more competitive deposit market notwithstanding a seasonal industrywide competitive pressure our de novo branches those opened five years or less grew deposit balances by 6 8 during the quarter and 30 during the year during the year we opened three new retail deposit branches all in washington we also consolidated two smaller branches in eastern washington into nearby branches lastly we announced our agreement to acquire a retail deposit branch including approximately 123 million of both deposits and commercial loans and a commercial lending team in san diego county we expect that transaction to close in march of this year after the quarter we opened retail deposit branches in san jose and santa clara california these are our first deposit branches in northern california and these branches will both open new markets for us but also will allow us to better serve existing commercial and consuming customers in northern california asset the quality remained strong during the quarter with our non performing asset ratio ending at 17 basis points of total assets our early warning credit indicators continued to reflect strong fundamentals in all of our markets we are keeping a careful eye on some of the secondary smaller markets on our footprint since these markets have historically exhibited a rare price volatility compared to primary markets during the downturn however job creation unemployment commercial and residential development activity and absorption vacancies cap rates and all other leading indicators of economic activity continue to reflect strong fundamentals while lower commission expenses on lower loan origination volume was the primary reason for the reduction in our non interest expense during 2018 our cost savings initiatives in 2017 and 2018 have also materially reduced these expenses as a result of these thoughtful operational changes base salaries occupancy and g a expenses are all meaningfully lower we reduced total headcount to 16 during the year and single family home loan centers including satellite locations decrease from 70 to 53 we believe that these cost savings initiatives will position the company for improved efficiency and profitability additionally while we expect our mortgage banking business profitability to improve as the mortgage cycle improves while we wait for this part of the cycle to end we are considering additional operational and strategic changes to further improve the profitability of the mortgage business during 2018 we sold 4 9 billion in unpaid principal balance of single family mortgage servicing rights and modified our loss sharing agreement with fannie mae related to our dus service both of these strategies improved our regulatory capital ratios also during the year we continued to refresh our board of directors by appointing mark patterson and sandra cavanaugh to the board adding valuable skill sets and perspective to our board since joining the board they have both made valuable contributions toward improved governance and our strategic objectives don voss who joined the board with our acquisition of simplicity bank was named the lead independent director since last proxy season we have held productive discussions regarding corporate governance business strategy and our results with most of our significant shareholders these discussions have given the management and the board meaningful insight on shareholder views on these subjects and positioned us well for the coming proxy season finally a few comments on the recent events and their effect on us many of you may remember the devastating wildfires that impacted parts of california during the fourth quarter with thousands of homes lost in the fire affected areas we have not seen a material impact to homestreet borrowers as all had adequate insurance in place for our borrowers who were affected many have paid off their loans in full with insurance proceeds while a few were taking out construction loans to rebuild additionally homestreet has less than 30 borrowers that are experiencing some financial distress due to their places of employment being affected by the fires we re not seeing any material uptick in single family mortgage delinquencies and we will continue to work with effective borrowers or monitoring the situation additionally we are keeping a careful watch on the effects of the ongoing federal government shutdown on our business we are receiving inquiries from furloughed federal workers about possible single family mortgage forbearance but today only four borrowers to apply for this loss mitigation the rest are using accumulated savings for the time being we stand ready to provide assistance in the form of late fee waivers loan modifications and short term loans where warranted the most acute impact however is on our sba lending business as part of the shutdown the sba is not issuing low numbers so loans cannot be closed or funded the secondary market for sba loan guarantee sales are also closed so loan sales will not recommence until after the government reopens other adverse effects may emerge as the shutdown persists and now i ll turn it over to mark who will share the details of our financial results mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer thank you mark good morning everyone and thank you again for joining us i will first talk about our consolidated results and then provide detail on our two operating segments regarding our operating results net income for the fourth quarter of 18 was 15 2 million or 0 56 per diluted share compared to 11 8 million or 0 44 per diluted share for the third quarter one time items includes the net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 or a non core net recovery of 622 000 of restructuring and acquisition related items net of tax and a non core 4 9 million income tax benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability position related to the tax cuts and jobs act legislation enacted in december december 17 recognized in relation to the filing of our 2017 federal tax return excluding the impact of these charges core net income for the fourth quarter was 9 7 million or 0 36 per diluted share compared to core net income of 12 3 million or 0 45 per diluted share for the third quarter the decrease in core net income from the prior quarter was primarily due to lower non interest income largely from seasonally lower net gain on loan origination and sale activities in our mortgage banking segment net interest income decreased by 272 000 to 51 4 million in the fourth quarter from 51 6 million in the third quarter this decrease in net interest income is primarily due to our slightly compressing net interest margin of 3 19 which decreased 1 basis point in the third quarter s net interest margin of 3 20 while our retail deposit bases have remained relatively low our wholesale deposit and borrowing cost have continued to increase as the federal reserve continued to increase short term interest rates during the quarter this increase in funding costs was partially offset by higher yields on our interest earning assets non interest expense excluding the net impact of acquisition and restructuring related items decreased to 85 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from 94 1 million in the third quarter this decrease in non interest expense was primarily from lower commissioning costs on lower closed single family mortgage loan volume but also due expense to expense reduction initiatives total non interest expense declined by 49 1 million or 11 2 for the year ended december 31 18 compared to the year ended december 31 17 the primary driver for this reduction was lower incentives and commission expenses due to lower mortgage loan volume however as a result of our 2017 and 2018 expense reduction initiatives we achieved on a core basis a 14 million or 8 8 decrease in base salary for the year ended december 31 18 compared to the year ended december 31 17 due to the overall reduction in our headcount our expense reduction initiative also reduced the general and administrative expenses on a core basis by 11 3 million or 70 during 2018 finally we reduced occupancy expense on a core basis by 2 6 million or 7 5 during 2018 due in part to reducing our total office count from 138 to 123 during the year these expense reductions were partially offset by increases in information services expense as we continue to invest in upgrading our technology platform our effective income tax benefits rate of negative 2 5 for the fourth quarter of 2018 differs from our combined federal and blended state statutory tax rate of 23 6 primarily due to a tax benefit of 3 7 million comprised of a non core 4 9 million benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability position related to the tax cuts and jobs act and a core expense of 1 2 million related to the filing of our 2017 federal tax return i ll now discuss some key points from our commercial and consumer banking segment results commercial and consumer banking segments core net income was 14 3 million in the fourth quarter a decrease of 2 3 million from core net income 16 6 million in the third quarter the decrease in core income was primarily due to the previously mentioned tax benefit related to the filing of our 2017 federal tax return net interest income increased 1 million from the third quarter of 2018 to 48 9 million primarily due to the growth in our loan held for investments our portfolio of loan held for investments in this segment increased by 47 9 million or 1 during the fourth quarter growth occurred throughout the portfolio with the exception of a decline in the single family mortgage portfolio from the previously mentioned sales of single family mortgage loans during the quarter segment noninterest income decreased quarter to quarter to 10 4 million from 10 7 million this decrease with primarily do slightly lower profit margin from our sales of multifamily fannie mae dus loans and small balance commercial real estate loans during the quarter segment core non interest expense was 38 3 million an increase of 518 000 from the third quarter of a 18 this increase was primarily due to higher salaries and related costs as we added headcount ahead of two northern california retail deposit branches that were opened in early january of 19 non performing assets increased to 12 1 million or 17 basis points of assets at december 31st compared to 15 basis points of assets at september 30th we recorded a 500 000 provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter compared to 750 000 in the third quarter the decrease in provision was primarily due to a 559 000 due to a 559 000 of net recovery during the fourth quarter compared to net recovery of 122 000 during the third quarter deposit balances were 5 1 billion at december 31st a decrease of 103 6 million from september 30th i ll now share some key points from our mortgage banking segment results the mortgage banking segment s core net loss in the fourth quarter was 4 5 million compared to core net loss of 4 3 million in the third quarter compared to last quarter we had seasonally lower interest rate loss commitment that resulted in decrease in gain on loan origination and sale activity and lower mortgage banking servicing income offset some of our lower core non interest expense when single family interest rate locks are less than closings in a given quarter earnings are negatively affected as the majority of mortgage revenue is recognized at interest rate locks while majority of originating costs including commissions are recognized upon closing accordingly the larger balance between interest rate lock volume and close loan volume during the third quarter normalized during the fourth quarter resulting in lower differential between gain on loan origination sale revenue and salaries and commissions expense our gain on mortgage loan origination and sales composite margin was 323 basis points a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter primarily due to an increase in higher profit margin refinance and fha and va transactions in our origination mix mortgage banking segment core non interest expense of 47 1 million decreased 9 2 million from the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to the decrease in commissions paid as a result of lower closed mortgage loan volume single family mortgage servicing income was 5 4 million in the fourth quarter a decrease from 6 9 million in the third quarter this decrease was primarily due to lower risk management results partially offset by higher servicing income lower risk management results were primarily driven by a more volatile interest rate environment the continued flattening of the yield curve and increased negative convexity costs the increase in servicing income is related to a higher average balance of loans serviced for others our portfolio of single family loan serviced for others increased to 20 2 million of unpaid principal balances at december 31st compared to 19 8 million at september 30th the value of our mortgage servicing rights relative to the balance of loans serviced for others was 125 basis points at quarter end a decrease of 8 basis points compared to prior quarter end thanks for your attention and i ll turn it back over to mark mason mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thank you mark during the past year we ve made substantial changes in our mortgage banking business to improve profitability in response to the current market conditions as i stated earlier we continue to consider both operational and strategic changes to improve further the profitability of this business we are providing guidance today assuming that we will continue with our current operations and strategy and that there are no material changes to the interest rate environment that existed in december 31 2018 current staffing levels mortgage production volume is forecast by the mba or original outlook for mortgage production may impact these numbers actual results may vary from the guidance we are giving today possibly in material ways if our actual strategy or future operations differ from these assumptions we anticipate single family and mortgage loan lock and forward sale commitment volume of 1 2 billion and 1 5 billion in the first and second quarters of this year respectively we anticipate mortgage held for sale closing volumes of 1 1 billion and 1 6 billion for the same periods for the full year of 2019 we anticipate single family mortgage loan lock in and forward sale commitments to total 5 2 billion and loan closing volume to total 5 3 billion we expect our mortgage composite profit margins to remain in the range of between 310 and 320 basis points during the next two quarters as well as for the full year of 2019 in our commercial and consumer banking segment we expect our quarterly loan portfolio growth to average between 2 and 4 throughout this year reflecting the yield curve as of the end of the fourth quarter and absent changes in market rates and loan prepayment speeds we expect our consolidated net interest margin to decrease to the range of 300 basis points to 310 basis points over the next two quarters and remain within that range throughout this year during the first and second quarters of this year we expect our total core non interest expense to increase approximately 6 to 8 given seasonally increasing closed single family mortgage loan expectations for the full year of 2019 we expect our average quarterly net change in total core non interest expenses to increase by approximately 3 reflecting the growth of the business overall total core non interest expenses will vary quarter to quarter driven by seasonality and cyclicality in both our single family and commercial real estate closed mortgage loan volume this concludes our prepared comments thank you for your attention today mark and i would be happy to answer any questions you have at this time questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from jeff rulis of d a davidson please go ahead jeff rulis d a davidson analyst all right thanks good morning mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president good morning jeff rulis d a davidson analyst first question is more on the expense side just wanted to see if the restructuring noise either expenses or recovers as we saw this quarter is that largely complete at this point there s no tailwind into 2019 is that what you expect mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president yes with respect to the expense restructurings in the mortgage business that were announced in the earlier in the year and this quarter we had a fair amount of revenue noise or contra expense noise related to income taxes we don t expect to repeat any of that going forward jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay and then the just on the msr side any i guess any thoughts on additional sales and then on a related just kind of the mortgage servicing line item from a revenue basis any expectations in 2019 mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president we do not have any planned sales of mortgage servicing at this time i can t rule it out because we have since the company has been public on two occasions sold servicing primarily for capital planning purposes but we don t have any plan at this time mortgage loan servicing revenue has been challenged over the last two years in particular as the yield curve flattened and you can see that the company s risk management results have declined during that time historically the company has had very strong servicing revenue associated not just with the growth of the servicing portfolio but with the results of risk management which is really hedging and typically the hedging income has been substantial but as the yield curve has flattened the earnings on the swaps portion of that hedge which is the lion share at times 75 of the hedge position those earnings have declined substantially and so we expect that servicing income will be muted despite slow servicing speeds until we have a lift in the yield curve jeff rulis d a davidson analyst great and maybe last one on the just on the npa the modest lift in what consumer and commercial any color on those i assume not systemic issues wasn t large but any additional detail on the increase mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president there s nothing noteworthy there there is probably a little volatility given how low the numbers are jeff rulis d a davidson analyst fair enough okay thank you mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks jeff operator the next question comes from steve moss of b riley fbr please go ahead steve moss b riley fbr analyst good morning mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president good morning steve moss b riley fbr analyst wondering just go on the locked volume guide of 5 2 billion for 2019 obviously a bit lower from what it was before just wondering what are the drivers behind that versus expectations before mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well recently we ve seen anecdotally in our markets and specifically in most recent data home sales volume decline and while this last quarter and currently as long rates declined a little bit we ve seen some resurgence in refinancing we can t expect that to continue either and so based upon those changes we have lowered our expectations a little bit steve moss b riley fbr analyst okay and then on the margin guide here going to 3 to 3 10 in the upcoming quarters just wondering is it primarily expect driven by funding costs here mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president yes or just the dividend speeds right funding costs rising faster than asset yield asset yields are still rising and to the extent that we see moderation in deposit betas that would be better but conservatively we thought that we needed to lower the expectation range steve moss b riley fbr analyst okay and then i guess my third question i m not sure if i heard you correctly mark but was at 2 to 4 loan growth per quarter or for the full year mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer that s still per quarter obviously we didn t make it last quarter but that was in part due to a sale of single family loans right we would have made that range had we not elected to sell some single family mortgages on to the portfolio steve moss b riley fbr analyst all right thank you very much mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks steve operator the next question comes from jackie bohlen of kbw please go ahead jackie bohlen kbw analyst hi good morning everyone mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president good morning jackie jackie bohlen kbw analyst wanted to touch based on expenses and looking primarily to headcount and any anticipated de novo branches plans you might have in the year and understanding of course that there are no announced plans for the mortgage banking segment but there the possibility exists mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president in terms of de novo branches we opened two in january that had been delayed for some period of time at this time we are not planning any additional de novo branches for the foreseeable future so headcount increases associated with the branch network system will define substantially from prior years right in terms of the mortgage business we have had some attrition as a consequence of low volumes and as a performance related issue we may have additional attrition if volume continues to decline as the market is suggesting right now so that affects both of course reduction in positions but also the operational positions depending upon total loan volume jackie bohlen kbw analyst and have you been replacing any of the attrition or just absorbing it with those that you have mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well we tried to replace attrition in production personnel with people with higher volume in today s market conditions that s the day in day out part of the business we will attempt to replace attrition so that we keep seats filled in the offices that we have today if there are empty seats the office will not be operating as efficiently as it could or should so we will be attempting to replace attrition of folks that are not been able to generate volume with those who do jackie bohlen kbw analyst okay so it sounds like then for the overall company the headcount could come up a little bit in 2019 outside of any additional announcements mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president very slightly we have we entered the year with some open positions at various places in the company but our expectations are that the total headcount not increase materially this year jackie bohlen kbw analyst okay and then given all the tax noise in the quarter would you mind just providing us with an updated guidance for an anticipated range going forward in terms of the tax rate mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer yes jackie yes sure i would use our estimated to for you again 20 5 i believe at the prior quarter we provided 21 but i would stick with 20 5 going forward jackie bohlen kbw analyst okay and the b o should normalize next quarter mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer that was one time event you wouldn t see that again and so b o will normalize which does not run through the tax line number that run through the g a line that threshold jackie bohlen kbw analyst yes mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer yes right got it jackie bohlen kbw analyst yes definitely understood okay great thanks guys mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks jackie operator the next question comes from tim o brien of sandler o neill and partners please go ahead tim o brien sandler o neill analyst good morning guys mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president hey tim tim o brien sandler o neill analyst a quick question for mark ruh do you happen to have the dollar amount of sba gain on sale income for the quarter for 4q mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer we provide the dollar amount i m looking at 484 000 tim o brien sandler o neill analyst okay mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer it s in the table that s where i looking at it s in page 12 for a table of commercial and consumer banking segment 484 000 tim o brien sandler o neill analyst sorry i missed that i looked but i missed it but thank you for that and then another question i have for you with the government shutdown possibly extending could that affect your single family mortgage business in any way shape or form mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer so far not materially there s a couple of government related loan programs that have issues like tim o brien sandler o neill analyst like da program mark ruh executive vice president chief financial officer there s a usda program and a department of homelands program that we do through fha that have both been shut down for a moment but they re not a material part of the originations tim o brien sandler o neill analyst okay and same thing on the multi side right not expected the impact the shutdown is not going to impact your multi sale business mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president fannie mae continues to operate right so fannie mae does business should be unaffected and the private business is not affected tim o brien sandler o neill analyst great and then you alluded to qualitatively some thoughts there might be some additional strategic changes that get looked at by the board this year mark could you talk a little bit about kind of the list of what some of those changes that might be considered could be any of them mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president you know we tim o brien sandler o neill analyst i put you on the spot there a little bit but mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well i want to give you a quality answer but the range of things that we look at is really why right i mean why as you might consider and so i don t want to overemphasize any particular option because that would suggest something that we are committed to doing and we re not yet but we continue to analyze ways to improve profitability of the size of our business the product lines within the business expense components there is a very tough time and while we have a deep and long history in the mortgage business status quo is not acceptable it s not acceptable to us it s not acceptable to our shareholders and you should expect us to go after fully analyzing additional changes make some changes that make a meaningful difference in the business tim o brien sandler o neill analyst so i guess looking into that the reverse of that are there any critical core parts of the business that you guys you can say right now that you remain committed to that probably won t see any meaningful material strategic adjustments around mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president that s kind of a tough question to answer because it s a very integrated business right and i think i ll just leave my comments where they are right now tim o brien sandler o neill analyst you re pretty open minded mark mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well we have to be right we have a responsibility here we have a lot of capital tied up in this business our shareholders capital my capital everybody s capital and we have been while we ve been active in trying to seek improved profitability we have been patient in believing that the cycle will turn and return superior profitability is taking a long time and while it s probably easier for us to be patient because we ve been through cycles there it s less easy for people who aren t as familiar and so we re doing a lot of work on analyzing the business today and that s all i am prepared to say tim o brien sandler o neill analyst hey guys thanks for the earnings call and for answering my questions and good luck in the new year mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks tim operator operator instructions the next question comes from tim coffey of fig partners please go ahead tim coffey fig partners analyst thank you good morning everybody mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president hey tim tim coffey fig partners analyst hey mark i was wondering can you provide little more detail on the residential mortgage loans that you ve sold out of the held for investment bucket mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president we took the opportunity to strip out a portion of that portfolio with an eye to one reducing the size a little but two trying to sell some lower coupon loans while the market rates were lower to improve the yields going forward tim coffey fig partners analyst okay and you have a outlook mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president i m sorry and in part responding to people inquiring of us whether we d be interested in selling a portion of the portfolio tim coffey fig partners analyst okay do you have other loans in the portfolio that kind of fit the characteristics of the loans that you sold mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well theoretically we always do it right if you think about originating continuously tim coffey fig partners analyst okay and then on the kind of commercial real estate loans sold in the quarter last couple of quarters you ve sold more than you ve originated given what we re seeing in the sba market and the trends that you ve shown in that cre non dust bucket could we see more loans being sold going forward than you originate and of course the portfolio you have of cre loans anyway is growing is that something we could see going forward mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well i think if you look at the full year last year was very seasonal in the first part of the year we originated more than we sold second part of the year we sold more than we originated i can t tell you exactly what the pattern is typically it s in part demand based right and demand grows in the second half of the year historically so that pattern great origination and sale of the first half greater the sale and origination in the second half is driven impart large part probably by a purchaser demand so i can t tell you exactly what the pattern will be but it will not surprise me if it s the same this year tim coffey fig partners analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then earlier in the q a you said that you re not expecting a resurgence in refi i m kind of wondering what you would need to see from the market to give you that indication that refi is picking up mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well it s picked up a little bit right if you look at the composition of lending and if you saw the december numbers and to extend january today the percentage of the composition of refi versus purchase has increased the dollar amount of that lending is still relatively weak right if you think about the lower levels seasonally i think it s important to remember that during the recession and the years following the recession as rates fell the industry refinanced a substantial amount of the mortgages in the united states and the average interest rate in the servicing portfolios across the united states is approximately the current rate and so the number of loans with a sufficient economic interest in refinancing is much smaller than in prior cycles at this time and so that s why i based my comments on tim coffey fig partners analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then the deposit cost trends i guess on total deposits we ve seen right around say 10 basis points increase every quarter throughout 2018 are you seeing that the trends are likely to be about the same or slowing mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president well everybody s portfolio is different right and their needs are different we i believe deposit costs are going to continue to increase at least our line of sight right and then if i can say was 10 too far but that s our view here that the pace is not going to change in the near term tim coffey fig partners analyst okay and then this one follow on on the san diego branch that you acquired i mean are going to close on in march it s effectively kind of a small bank good loans good deposits but one of the seasoned banker that i know of can you kind of talk about how that branch fits into the hierarchy of your southern california footprint mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president sure this was a particularly good deal for us because we do not currently have a commercial lending team in san diego we currently have four branches there primarily consumer branches though we have some growing commercial business there but it s being served or serviced out of orange county and so being able to have an in market team a well known track record bankers is real boost to our business and we re looking forward to great things for that group after they join us tim coffey fig partners analyst and your loan growth kind of guidance for next question that was organic right that didn t include this branch mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president loan growth for this year that has historically has been an inorganic forecast of ours yes tim coffey fig partners analyst okay yes i was just double checking all right thank you very much those are my questions mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president thanks tim operator and we have a follow up from jeff rulis of d a davidson please go ahead jeff rulis d a davidson analyst hey mark i just forgot or i didn t quite get the numbers down on the guidance i got the lock and closed for 2019 for the full year at 5 2 and 5 3 could you repeat the q1 and q2 lock and closed mark mason chairman chief executive officer and president sure it s locks are 1 2 billion and 1 5 billion for q1 and q2 and closings 1 1 billion and 1 6 billion jeff rulis d a davidson analyst great that was it thank you operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mark mason

statements contained in this document non gaap financial measures in this press release futurefuel used adjusted ebitda as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda is not a substitute for operating income net income or cash flow from operating activities each as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of performance or liquidity adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap futurefuel defines adjusted ebitda as net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization expenses excluding when applicable non cash share based compensation expense public offering expenses acquisition related transaction costs purchase accounting adjustments loss on disposal of property and equipment gains or losses on derivative instruments other non operating income or expense information relating to adjusted ebitda is provided so that investors have the same data that management employs in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of futurefuel s business futurefuel s calculation of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies therefore the results of its calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies adjusted ebitda allows futurefuel s chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of futurefuel s business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of its operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs to fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends in particular futurefuel management believes that adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of futurefuel s operating performance and liquidity relative to a performance and liquidity based on gaap results while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization which may vary among its operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance and of non cash stock based compensation expense which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies and gains and losses on derivative instruments whose immediate recognition can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel a table included in this earnings release reconciles adjusted ebitda with net income the most

china s economy slowed further in the first two months of 2019 as the growth of industrial production fell to its lowest rate in a decade industrial production growth slowed to 5 3 per cent in january and february compared to the same period last year down from 5 7 per cent growth in december according to data released on thursday by the national bureau of statistics nbs the result was below the 5 6 per cent expected by analysts in a bloomberg survey the january and february output growth rate was the lowest since 5 1 per cent in march 2009 but of particular concern to the government will be the sharp rise in the surveyed unemployment rate to 5 3 per cent in january and february from 4 9 per cent in december the rate in the first two months of the year is the highest since hitting 5 4 per cent in february 2017 a month after the survey was first collected to smooth out the impact of the lunar new year holiday which began on february 5 this year 10 days earlier than last year the nbs only released combined data for the first two months of the year the latest activity and spending data suggest that economic conditions remained weak at the start of 2019 the statistics bureau publishes combined data for the first two months of the year in order to iron out seasonal volatility caused by annual shifts in the timing of chinese new year said julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics retail sales rose 8 2 per cent in january and february compared to the same months in 2018 the same rate as in december as in december the january and february rate was the lowest since june 2003 and was in line with expectations in the bloomberg survey the stable growth rate may indicate subdued consumer spending at the start of the year as retail sales usually receive a boost during the lunar new year holiday period a traditional gift giving period today s data means the economy will take a longer time to bottom out as industrial production and consumption are still under pressure despite the rebound in investment and the worsening jobless rate indicates more easing policies to come as policymakers always put employment at the first place said liu peiqian asia strategist at natwest markets plc in singapore fixed asset investment rose 6 1 per cent in the first two months of the year accelerating modestly from the 5 9 per cent growth rate posted for all of 2018 the result was also in line with expectations the rise in overall investment reflected a strong gain in the property sector where investment jumped to 11 6 per cent in january and february from 9 5 per cent in december reflecting in part a continued increase in government infrastructure investment but the overall property sector remained weak with property sales growth plunging to 2 8 per cent in the first two months of the year from 12 2 per cent in december at first glance the bright spot in the data was fixed investment this was driven by stronger property investment which offset a slowdown in manufacturing and infrastructure investment added evans pritchard however the data on property investment are often distorted by land acquisition costs and the more reliable data on real estate activity were more downbeat property sales continued to contract and growth in floor space started dropped back sharply china s economic growth has continued to slow at the start of 2019 due to the effects of the government s deleveraging campaign to reduce debt and risky lending and the ongoing trade war with the united states china overall growth rate dropped to 6 6 per cent last year the slowest growth rate in 28 years currently there are many external imbalance and uncertainties especially the global economic growth and international trade showed sign of slowing while domestic structural issues remain such as the fall of auto said nbs spokesman mao shengyong the chinese economy could stay healthy if counter cyclical policies were fully in place the government acknowledged the slowdown last week by setting a growth target range of between 6 0 per cent to 6 5 per cent for this year with the target range giving it leeway in the face of continued uncertainties about the domestic and global growth outlooks the government has also enacted a series of fiscal stimulus measures including tax cuts and additional funds for local government infrastructure spending in an effort to stabilise growth zhang jun chief economist of morgan stanley huaxin securities in shanghai said the january and february data indicated consumption was still pretty weak while two major parts of fixed asset investment property and manufacturing investment are constrained by rising stocks and the squeezed corporate profitability infrastructure construction will recover but can hardly prop up the country s investment especially under the slogan of stabilising the macro leverage he said more consumption boosting measures are needed this year however the government is closely watching the lagged effects of previously announced measures including cuts of the required reserve ratio for banks and personal income tax and the impact of the recently announced corporate tax reduction before considering next moves what the authority now tries to do is to make the decline mild and controllable zhang added a crucial factor to the economic outlook is whether the government will be able to resolve its trade dispute with the us while officials have said that progress continues to be made toward a deal us trade representative robert lighthizer told the us congress this week that a number of important issues remain unresolved we expect beijing to ramp up supportive policies in coming months and still believe deregulating the property markets in big cities is the key to unlocking a growth recovery said nomura s chief china economist lu ting one of the moves lu added would be a 50 basis point cut of required reserve ratio the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank by the people s bank of china as early as april source south china morning post

sanctions do not target the people of zimbabwe us targets sanctions on those who engage in corruption violate human rights or undermine democratic institutions not the people of zimbabwe well the true nature and purpose of the sanctions was outlined by then us assistant secretary of state for african affairs chester crocker during senate hearings on the so called zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act on june 13 2000 before it was made into law in 2002 crocker said then to separate the zimbabwean people from zanu pf we are going to have to make their economy scream and i hope you senators have the stomach for what you have to do so if we were to decide to try and work for change in power in zimbabwe i would hope that we would have the wisdom to be discreet to be low key and to avoid giving those in power there the excuse that foreigners are out to get them the cat has been out of the bag since then on the surface the us lies about the lifting of sanctions being based on political and economic reform while behind the scenes it is all about regime change ever since zimbabwe s economy has been screaming as maliciously intended by the us sparing no one from the top to the bottom dispelling the lies by the us embassy individuals not on the so called targeted sanctions list have their tales to tell a colleague charles rukuni one of the most respected independent zimbabwean journalists out there recounted his personal deprivation because of sanctions i have tried for years to convince zimbabweans that the us sanctions do not only apply to politicians because i was denied a contract in malawi when the beneficiaries recommended me for an in house training programme simply because i was from zimbabwe this happened some years ago prior to june 2009 before i left the financial gazette this week a person who is vociferously pro sanctions had a taste of his own medicine or as they say in shona akarumwa nechekuchera as sanctions came home to roost when this sanctions zealot tried to register with paypal an american company operating a worldwide online payments system he was plainly told that this was out of bounds for any zimbabwean whether they oppose their government or not every act has unintended consequences you can be caught in the same trap you set this individual s anti government stance was not enough for the us to exempt him from the sanctions he is as much collateral damage as you and me as one zimbabwean edson mabibi observed gullible people who cannot separate party politics and national interests deserve such a wake up call chipped in simbarashe manhanga some people cannot see what is in front of them all they do is being used politically supporting things that actually disadvantage them are those hundreds of thousands of zimbabweans who have been queuing for months and weeks at western union and branches of other money transfer firms to collect remitted money and failing on the targeted sanctions list not at all it s because of the nefarious and contagion effect of the sanctions as this is playing according to crocker s regime change script how many people with chronic illnesses like diabetes could have died because of this sick charade by the americans well one rejoice ngwenya in the vociferous style of our paypal compatriot won t hear of that he fumed rudely saying iwe hey you tutani talk about the causes not symptoms of sanctions incredibly he reduces that possible loss of lives to a mere symptom of sanctions well unwitting levity goes together with lack of understanding one cannot say the death of all 157 people aboard an ethiopian airlines passenger plane this week was a mere symptom of mechanical or software failure by boeing the manufacturer of the plane after the event you cannot talk of symptom but consequence the law of levity should not be allowed to supersede the law of gravity the gravity of the situation the same with fuel queues wherever and whenever one sees a fuel queue they should also see sanctions there is a direct causal not casual link yes some people will find that most hard to digest because this completely destroys the political diet they have been fed all along offloading all the blame on the government but with time they will see the light it might be traumatic it might be worse than drinking poison it might be a hard pill to swallow it might sound like a substitute who is brought in and immediately scores an own goal but although it shakes the foundation of one s political beliefs it should not take them the 359 years from 1633 to 1992 it took for the roman catholic church to finally admit that galileo was correct in saying that the earth moves around the sun not vice versa dogma whether religious or political holds back the nation to get the whole picture american economist professor michael hudson one of the most respected independent economists in the world who is currently with the university of missouri kansas city lays out how the world should respond to the rapaciousness of the us where it imposes itself to extract maximum benefit referring to venezuela which is under a political and economic siege by the us hudson says an alternative also is needed to the world bank that would make loans in domestic currency above all to subsidise investment in domestic food production so as to protect the economy against foreign food sanctions the equivalent of a military siege to force a military surrender by imposing famine conditions who does not see that the us is using this scorched earth policy in venezuela and zimbabwe indeed the world cannot just fold hands and watch while the us trashes anything and everything in its path that has to be countered hudson this hostage taking now makes it urgent for other countries to develop a viable alternative especially as the world de dollarises and a gold exchange standard remains the only way of constraining the us any worse vampire than that hudson points out just as us policy in the 1970s under then secretary of state henry kissinger was to make chile s economy scream so the us is following the same path against venezuela that word scream goes a long way back eh with crocker using it against zimbabwe now it s like hudson is talking about zimbabwe s current plight no country should be obliged to pay foreign debt in a currency such as the dollar or its satellites whose us banking system acts to prevent payment the us is making impossible demands on zimbabwe by on the one hand insisting on repayment of loans in us dollars and on the other hand closing all us dollar transactions involving zimbabwe in the global financial system even americans like hudson see the gross injustice of this but you have one zimbabwean frivolously dwelling on what he she calls symptoms talk of captured minds conway nkumbuzo tutani is a harare based columnist email
