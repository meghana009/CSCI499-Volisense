as many of us already know balancing the objectives of price stability with output stabilisation especially in the face of external headwinds remains a challenge to monetary policy and central banks particularly in emerging and developing economies since the global financial crisis many central banks have begun to promote structural transformation and economic growth beyond the singular mandate of price stability consequently policy toolkits now contain instruments that are aimed at developing the financial sector engendering wider financial inclusion and aligning financial policies with sustainable development and growth as some of you may know the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 which was trigged by the housing price bubble in the united states created considerable uncertainty in the global financial market and uncovered the weakness of many economies it also exposed the inadequacies of conventional monetary policies in tackling the challenges that came as a result of the crisis as a result the united states and several countries within the euro area fell into a recession between 2008 2009 before the onset of that crises policymaking at central banks had been dominated by neo liberal and orthodox doctrines as promoted by key bretton woods institutions like the international monetary fund imf these tenets emphasised price stability as the sole and exclusive mandate of central banks however lessons learnt from recent crises in addition to the global financial crisis have raised doubts on the validity of this position what became obvious following the gfs crisis is that conventional monetary policy tools were not sufficient in dealing with the complexities resulting from the crisis such as debt overhang and stagnating economic growth as a result central banks in the us and in the euro area had to utilize unconventional tools in their efforts to achieve their macroeconomic goals of output growth and price stability the use of unconventional tools such as quantitative easing and forward guidance led to a growth recovery in the us as well as a reduction in the unemployment rate on the reverse side and not withstanding its achievements it is conceivable that unconventional policies could heighten tradeoffs such as its resulting effect on the balance sheets of central banks in this discussion i will highlight the cbn experience with unconventional monetary policies tools in light of the extraordinary challenges the nigerian economy faced as a result of drop in commodity prices between 2014 2016 i will also discuss some of the key challenges confronting the bank in the formulation and implementation of unconventional monetary policy tools including the reaction of key bretton woods institutions to our approach the policy remit of the cbn though the 2007 cbn act specifies price stability as the overriding mandate of the bank permit me to highlight here that the operationalisation of this mandate is somewhat tricky what exactly does price stability denote paul volcker and alan greenspan former governors of the us fed have defined it as what obtains when the public no longer takes account of actual or prospective inflation in its decision making for the cbn it is achieved when inflation lies within the tolerance band of 6 9 percent within this band we believe that the evolution of relative prices is able to optimize the micro objectives of firms and households while maximising total utilitarian welfare of the economy for an economy like ours which is yet to attain its full potential utilitarian welfare maximisation requires a functional consideration for real growth thus growth objectives cannot be overlooked the cbn act 2007 in recognising this provided the bank with the legal backing to undertake developmental functions that are consistent with price stability this has enabled the bank to simultaneously promote the development of financial markets and stimulate the growth of the real sector recent experience of the cbn ladies and gentlemen the cbn s experience with heterodox policies expanded during the recent economic crisis that begun in 2014 due to a number of global shocks three of which were simultaneous and significant in shaping the trajectory of the nigerian economy namely i widespread and rising geopolitical tensions along critical trading routes in the world this began around march 2014 with the united states led sanctions on russia for its role in precipitating the conflict in ukraine other areas include britain s desire to pull out from the european union and rising trade tensions between the united states and china with its attendant implications on global trade and capital flows ii softening crude oil prices the significant drop in the price of bonny light nigeria s crude from us 115 per barrel in june 2014 to us 31 per barrel by january 2016 exposed the structural vulnerabilities of an oil dependent economies like ours and iii normalisation of monetary policy by the us fed in october 2014 the us federal reserve commenced the tapering of its quantitative easing programme towards a more conventional monetary tightening cycle this decision led to acute capital flow reversals especially from emerging markets and heightened financial fragilities in these countries effects on the domestic economy unarguably the most important of these factors to impact the nigerian economy was the plunge in crude oil price nigeria s overdependence on crude oil for over 60 percent of fiscal revenue and over 90 percent of fx inflows meant that shocks in the oil market were transmitted entirely to the economy via the fx markets as manufacturers and traders who required fx for input purchases were faced with dwindling supplies average monthly inflows of fx into the cbn fell from over us 3 4bn in june 2014 to a low of us 1 4bn in september 2016 the decline in fx earnings was further complicated by the foreign capital flow reversals due to rising yields in the usa the impact of these on our economy was evident in the rising pressure on the naira dollar exchange rate with the drop in fx inflows the exchange rate at the parallel market rose from about n200 us in august 2015 to n525 us in february 2017 inflation also rose from 9 6 percent in january 2016 to over 18 7 percent in january 2017 our external reserves fell from about us 31bn in april 2015 to us 23bn in october 2016 and activities in the industrial sector witnessed a lull as manufacturers struggled to get access to key inputs needed in the production process other vulnerabilities include slowdown in government spending following the fall in government revenue build up in the demand for foreign exchange and high exposure of the banking sector to the oil and gas sector driven largely by the downside effects of these shocks real gdp growth plunged sharply from 6 2 percent in 2014 to a 1 6 percent contraction in 2016 nigeria effectively slipped into a technical recession in the second quarter of 2016 and maintained negative growths in ensuing quarters of that year disaggregation of the 2016 outcomes showed the worst contraction of 2 4 percent in quarter three and a turning point thereafter addressing the recession the monetary and fiscal policy mix in a bid to contain rising inflation and to cushion the impact of the drop in fx supply on the nigerian economy the monetary and fiscal authorities took extraordinary measures to tackle these extraordinary challenges some of the measures we took a number of which are indeed unconventional include monetary policy over the intervening period the cbn embarked on a cycle of tightening which culminated in a july 2016 hike in the monetary policy rate from 12 percent to 14 percent this decision was expected to rein in expected inflationary pressures that may result from exchange rate pass through to domestic prices and ensure that inflation expectations are well anchored it was also expected to stimulate increased capital inflows to the country which should improve accretion to reserves conserving our fx we introduced demand management approaches to conserve our reserves and support domestic production of certain goods in nigeria in this regard we analysed our import bill and encouraged manufacturers to consider local options in sourcing their raw materials by restricting access to foreign exchange on 41 items now increased to 43 four of these items alone constitute over n1 trillion of our annual import bill fx market in april 2017 we introduced an investors and exporters i e window which allowed investors and exporters to purchase and sell foreign exchange at the prevailing market rate in addition exchange rate management was further liberalized following the operationalisation of the revised guidelines for the operation of the nigerian inter bank foreign exchange market in june 2016 the commencement of this policy guideline introduced the naira settled foreign exchange futures market risk based supervision the weakening of the naira following the shift to a more flexible foreign exchange mechanism along with the exposure of several banks to the oil and gas sector impacted somewhat on the balance sheets of domestic banks to support the health of the banking system the cbn took a number of steps including o monitoring compliance of supervised institutions with the foreign exchange management framework issued in june 2016 through our risk based supervision methodology o monitoring the financial position and performance of supervised institutions o assessment of the risk profile and governance management practices of banks and in the event of major deteriorations on any key risk indicator we engaged with the affected bank in order to mitigate concerns and shore up their capital base development finance intervention the cbn increased its lending to the agricultural and industrial sectors through targeted intervention schemes such as the anchor borrowers program commercial agricultural credit scheme and the real sector support facility in particular we sought to improve domestic supply of four commodities rice fish sugar and wheat which consume about n1 3 trillion annually in our nation s import bill the anchor borrowers programme abp which was launched in november 2015 was designed to build partnerships between small holder farmers and reliable large scale agro processors with a view to increasing agricultural output while improving access to credit for farmers our targeted focus on the agricultural and industrial sectors were driven by the vast opportunities for growth in these sectors given our high population it was also instrumental in taking nigeria out of the recession in 2017 over 50 percent of the contributions to gdp growth came from the agriculture and industrial sectors these sectors have the ability to absorb the growing labor pool of eligible workers in our effort to meet the household consumption needs of the nigerian populace if efforts were made to improve productivity gains in these sectors it will reduce our dependence on imported items that could be produced in nigeria furthermore improved productivity in the agriculture and manufacturing could also help in reducing our dependence on proceeds from crude oil in 2017 nigeria s total revenue from exports of crude oil was us 23 billion relative to indonesia which earned close to us 22bn from the export of palm oil in 2017 nigeria has vast amounts of arable land that can be put to good use in the cultivation of not only palm oil but also cotton cocoa tomatoes and rice to mention a few supporting growth in the agriculture and industrial sectors is critical in our efforts to create a diversified wealth base for the country doctrinal critique of our policies by bretton woods while many of these measures were an attempt at using unconventional tools to mitigate the effects of a slowdown in growth they were initially criticised by adherents of conventional monetary policy tools in the view of some critics for instance our fx policies constitute exchange restrictions rationing of fx discretionary allocation based on priority categories and a multiple currency practice many are also unaccepting of our 41 items restriction and its recent increase to 43 items regardless of its apparent successes while there is sufficient evidence of significant reductions in our annual import bill increased non oil output and exports and a robust bop position these critics assert that we are restricting trade and creating unfair competition to our critics who are against the imposition of the fx restrictions conventional monetary policy requires that to encourage domestic production we should impose higher tariffs and levies however our experience in nigeria has shown that this practice has never worked due to certain inefficiencies in attaining these objectives our development finance initiatives in growth driving and employment generating sectors have equally not gone down well with the proponents of conventional monetary policy tools while they acknowledged our measures have had a positive impact on output and employment they assert that these tools constitute quasi fiscal activities they also maintain that implicit interest rate subsidies can have distortive effects on resource allocation our argument for the unconventional monetary policy approach has always been that just like fiscal monetary policy could at a time when development challenges abound complement the efforts of the fiscal in employment generation wealth creation and attainment of other growth objectives policy outcomes and exit from recession regardless of these scathing views and critiques the fact remains these unorthodox policies were well conceived and has been yielding significant gains for the nigerian economy noticeable successful outcomes are gleaned from i gdp after 5 consecutive quarters of negative growth beginning in the first quarter of 2016 a coordinated approach by the fiscal and monetary authorities supported a rebound in the nation s economy during the second quarter of 2017 the recovery has been driven largely by improved non oil activities especially the agriculture sector which expanded consistently by about 3 5 4 3 percent reflecting efforts at diversifying the economy this was nonetheless reinforced by the pickup in the oil sector as oil prices rallied in 2017 the recovery which has been sustained for eight consecutive quarters is expected to strengthen in the short to medium term ii inflation as a result of the implementation of a tighter monetary policy regime intervention programs in the agriculture and industrial sectors as well as improved fx inflows inflation began to decline from its peak of 18 7 percent in january 2017 it currently stands at 11 37 percent as at april 2019 iii reserves the introduction of the i e window along with improvement in domestic production of goods have helped shore up our external reserves transactions have reached over 48 billion since the inception of the window and our foreign exchange reserves has risen to us 45bn in april 2019 from us 23bn in october 2016 nigeria s current stock of external reserves is now able to finance over 9 months of current import commitments with improved availability of foreign exchange the exchange rate at the i e fx window has remained stable over the past 24 months at an average of n360 us and the parallel market exchange rate has appreciated from n525 us in february 2017 to n360 us today iv anchor borrowers program the program has helped to bolster agricultural production by removing obstacles faced by small holder farmers we have also improved access to markets for farmers by facilitating greater partnership with agro processors and industrial firms in the sourcing of raw materials so far the program has supported more than 1 059 604 small holder farmers across all the 36 states of nigeria in cultivating 16 different commodities over 1 114 million hectares of farmland it has also supported the creation of over 2 5m jobs across the agricultural value chain v industrial sector activities in the industrial sector also witnessed significant improvement between august 2016 and february 2019 as the primary manufacturing index rose from a low of 42 percent in august 2016 to 57 percent in april 2019 this development was attributed to sustained supply of fx and the dogged implementation of our fx restriction on certain items vi because of our unconventional fx and development finance policies we have recorded spectacular improvements in domestic production of most of the targeted items local manufacturers are consequently reporting major boosts to their revenue and profit peer review in assessing nigeria s recovery efforts and performance it is essential to conduct a comparative assessment of our peers strikingly it will be discovered that nigeria did not fare badly vis à vis other emerging market economies like brazil south africa turkey and argentina that had similar economic experiences amidst the growing challenges nigeria has managed to keep real gdp growth positive and has avoided a double dip recession in contrast to some other emerging markets economies in comparison and following its 2016 contractions the south african economy recorded a double dip recession with renewed contractions of 2 6 and 0 7 percent in the first and second quarters of 2018 respectively its economy grew by 8 percent in 2018 in argentina though the economy was in recession throughout 2016 moderate upticks which peaked at 1 9 percent quarter two of 2017 ended that recession however the argentinian economy fell back into a recession as gdp growth declined by 1 percent in 2018 the brazilian economy had been in recession since 2015 and only emerged from it the first quarter of 2017 with a growth rate of 1 0 percent since then the growth has slowed progressively until the last quarter of 2017 when growth remained flat economic recovery still remains tepid with a gdp growth rate of 1 1 percent in 2018 possible complexities of heterodox monetary policy while developmental mandate enhances the ability of central banks to foster economic growth this may come with appreciable hitches essentially policies designed to attain price stability may in fact lack congruence with the goal of economic growth there is therefore the need for a clear understanding of what the limits of central banks are when it is compelled to assume a growth mandate together with the traditional price stability goal some of the challenges include multi mandate risks some of the risks that might arise from central banks increased mandate are identified trade offs may possibly arise from the pursuit of growth and price stability objectives unconventional monetary policy tools could inadvertently cause liquidity surfeit and undermine price stability developmental roles may expose central banks to undue political pressure to the detriment of the economy balance sheet following the 2008 financial crisis many central banks including those of key advanced economies quickly realised the inadequacy of the conventional approach as they hit the lower limits of adjustments to their interest rates they thus looked for other approaches to bolster the real economy these banks including the us fed the bank of england the european central bank the bank of japan etc experienced considerable expansions of their balance sheet while adopting an unconventional monetary policy approach their experiences show that growth financing monetary policy may lead to unsustainably expanded balance sheet of the central bank especially if there are no robust means of contracting the balance sheet when the need arises an expanded balance sheet could portend inflation risk as monetary aggregates grow and financial stability risk due to excessive credit expansion regardless of these probable complexities the cost benefit analysis of undertaking unconventional monetary policies indicates that the societal gains of such policies outstrip whatever challenges that may subsist the experience since the global financial crises show that growth consideration cannot be sacrificed over the long term for an exclusive focus on price stability because unabated real contractions and the associated persistent negative output gaps can only lead to declining potential output an outcome which is entirely dangerous for any economy given the structural fall in its long run growth trajectory way forward ladies and gentlemen relative to our peers the favourable outcomes and strengthening outlook of the nigerian economy is traceable to the timeous adoption on non traditional policy methods the cbn has been able to reduce inflation build our fx reserves maintained fx market stability and foster real growth nonetheless challenges still remain the pace of population growth at about 2 6 percent still outstrips real growth rate while inflation is outside our tolerance band unemployment rate and incidence of poverty remain at unacceptable levels i am happy to note that much of the success we see today is due to the adoption of heterodox macroeconomic policies within the cbn our unconventional methods especially in the management of the fx market and our development financing supported by the orthodox approaches in the form of our timely adjustments of monetary policy rate have been able to optimally balance the delicate objectives of price stability and real output growth we will continue to develop policy instruments and device ways of ensuring that an optimal mix of heterodox policies is continually deployed to engender the overall wellbeing and prosperity of the nigerian economy our overall aim remains the concurrent attainment of price stability real growth full employment and poverty reduction

published wednesday 5 june 2019 print disqus by richard rick mills gold was riding high monday on bad news regarding the us economy causing stocks to fall and wall street traders to pile into bullion us markets were choppy on the first trading day after june 1 when the united states increased the tariff on 200 billion of chinese imports from 10 to 25 shares of the so called faang stocks slumped pulling the s p 500 and the dow with them after media reports that the department of justice is weighing actions against google and apple and the federal trade commission said it wants to conduct a probe against facebook for improper use of data roller coaster dow jones contributing to the jitters was a white paper from china published over the weekend that blamed the us for escalating the trade war ie imposing 25 tariffs following an accusation that china backtracked on commitments agreed to earlier the u s government accusation of chinese backtracking is totally groundless it is common practice for both sides to make new proposals for adjustments to the text and language in ongoing consultations the white paper read in the previous more than 10 rounds of negotiations the u s administration kept changing its demands it is reckless to accuse china of backtracking while the talks are still under way us president trump responded that the tariffs on china are working with chinese firms leaving the country to avoid paying tariffs no visible increase in inflation and the us taking billions the imf showed that the billions in tariffs are actually being paid by us companies not chinese firms as trump has argued he also accused china of subsidizing its industries to help them cope with the trade war all the uncertainty was enough to propel gold to a two month high as of 14 37 new york time the precious metal was holding at 1 324 38 a climb of nearly 43 since may 1 when gold finished at 1 281 40 the price was helped by a 0 1 point drop in the us dollar index since may 31 the index has dropped over a full point from 98 12 to the current 97 06 gold and the usd normally move in opposite directions there are plenty of other reasons to believe we are heading into a summer exploration season backstopped by some very bullish signs for gold this article gets into the nitty gritty of each and concludes that now is a very good time to be owning promising junior gold stocks as a wager on rising gold prices and some spectacular drill results forward looking indicators the first reason is a set of forward looking indicators that show the us economy has all but stopped growing from the 3 2 it managed in the first quarter the pmi the ism manufacturing index and orders for durable goods orders for durable goods are down and the purchasing managers index pmi of the countries that count are frankly sucking wind wolf street called the us pmi figure 50 2 the cleanest of the dirty shirts germany japan and china were all lower the finance publication notes that orders for durable goods like cars and appliances have steadily ticked down since december and have shown no growth for three months in a row the pmis for us services and manufacturing in may were the lowest since recessionary 2009 after the data was released gdp forecasts for the second quarter were slashed from 2 2 to 2 in the best case scenario barclays plc to 2 25 to 1 in the worst case jpmorgan chase pouring more kerosene on the fire was another bad report released on monday by the institute for supply management its manufacturing index read 52 1 in april weaker than consensus forecasts which expected 53 readings above 50 are seen as a sign of economic growth zero hedge notes that the 52 1 figure was the weakest since october 2016 despite a kick of new export orders and employment the fact that three of five ism components production inventories and supplier deliveries declined is a worrying sign that stagflation is looming when unemployment and inflation both rise and economic growth falls no trade deal the lack of a trade deal between the us and china of course it s what scaring everybody into thinking that we could be in for a long

now and inflation later scotiabank commodity strategist nicky shiels wrote in a macro update last week the us president isn t helping matters by his erratic careless messaging that is putting the country at odds with its so called allies on monday trump kicked off a state visit to the united kingdom by calling london s mayor a stone cold loser after mayor sadiq khan said trump is one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat to liberal democracy from the far right trump ended last week by impetuously threatening mexico with 5 tariffs on june 10 if moves are not made to stem migrants from central america cnn business noted that mexico is now the united states largest trading partner and that the tax on imports would affect just about every sector of the american economy including autos electronics oil food products and appliances yield curve inversion in may the yield curve between 10 year and 3 month treasury notes re inverted after dipping in march into negative territory for the first time since 2007 marketwatch reported the yield on the 10 year note fell to 2 402 below the 3 month note s 2 406 yield an inverted 10 year 3 month yield curve is a reliable recession indicator the yield curve is the difference in returns between short term and long term bonds the curve has been inverted since may 23 the yields on long term treasury bills are getting worse they should be much higher than short term notes because investors demand a higher interest rate for holding bonds long term on monday the yield on the 10 year note fell below 2 07 the lowest in 20 months while the 30 year bond also slumped to 2 53 forbes quotes an economist at moody s analytics saying that the yield curve inversion spells bad news ahead for the us economy generally the yield curve inverts when investors are worried about the long term outlook of the economy said deritis most economists say an inverted yield doesn t cause a recession but reflects negative sentiment about growth meanwhile in canada which takes its cues from the us economy the yield curve on government bonds inverted the most since 2007 on worries that trump s threat to impose tariffs on mexican imports could mean the demise of the new nafta agreement ten year bond yields last friday fell five basis points to 1 51 and 17 points below the three month notes said bloomberg trade war with europe the us federal reserve pays close attention to the yield curve as it is a measure of investors confidence in the economy the fed had planned to raise interest rates this year on the strength of a growing economy but has since backed off considering the negative outlook for global growth and concerns over the us economy now the fed is watching bond yields to see if a further yield curve inversion will drag the dollar down which would be good for gold prices a little out of left field morgan stanley thinks it s not the us china trade dispute investors should be paying attention to but a looming trade conflict with the european union that could seriously dent the economy the trump administration was planning on slapping a 25 tariff on european car imports on may 18 but has deferred a decision for six months the morgan stanley analysts said in a report that a trade war with europe would cause so much economic pain it would force the fed to lower interest rates to juice growth as for the fed its board of governors is hinting that a potential rate cut is being considered as a way to bolster a flagging economy the new york times states if the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation below our 2 percent objective or were it to indicate that global economic and financial developments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook officials would take that into account in assessing whether interest rates should continue to remain unchanged the fed s vice chairman richard clarida said during a speech in new york on thursday depression analog in fact some would say the fed is downplaying a far greater risk to the economy heralded by the disturbing yield curve inversion and the trade war which appears to escalate by the week clive maund states in an editorial that what is going on now is very similar to what went down in the 1930 s with protectionism trade wars and then depression leading to a major war maund thinks a war between the us and iran is the most likely scenario given the neo conservative alliance with israel we agree with the first part and that iran is certainly a powder keg but the drama will be contained a more regional rather than global affair at ahead of the herd we prefer to place our bets on a military confrontation with china which certainly by the trump administration is seen as the enemy other authors agree over at project syndicate economics professor nouriel roubini argues that china and the us are gradually moving towards war maybe not a hot war although the constant tensions in the south china sea suggest otherwise but likely a cold war which is what historically happens when an emerging power china confronts an established power the us something called the thucydides trap what started as a trade war now threatens to escalate into a permanent state of mutual animosity this is reflected in the trump administration s national security strategy which deems china a strategic competitor that should be contained on all fronts for more on this read out trade war will hasten bull market for rare earths flashpoint taiwan we have written extensively on the tensions between the us and china in the south china sea where china holds historical claims despite international treaties to the contrary ie the un convention on the law of the sea ongoing maneuvers in the south china sea demonstrate that beijing is willing to flex its muscles in a region it sees as strategically and economically important china has been dredging seabed and building islands on which it has constructed outposts including missile batteries despite claims of ownership by vietnam malaysia philippines taiwan and brunei in 2016 steve bannon president donald trump s former chief strategist declared that there was no doubt in his mind that the us would go to war with china in the south china sea in the next five to 10 years there s also taiwan the united states supplies weapons to taiwan despite not having diplomatic relations with the island and its government china sees taiwan as a breakaway territory that must be re united with the chinese mainland its independence is not recognized by beijing a forced annexation of taiwan to china would almost certainly cause a war between china and the us the americans would never allow taiwan a key tentacle of us influence to be overtaken by the chinese yet that is exactly what beijing appears willing to go to war over shao yuanming a senior official of the people s liberation army reportedly said after a speech by acting us defense secretary patrick shanahan that china would defend its sovereignty over taiwan should anyone ie the us try to keep it separate from the mainland china will have to be reunified shao said on saturday if anybody wants to separate taiwan from china the chinese military will protect the country s sovereignty at all costs the next day defense minister wei fenghe equated president lincoln s efforts to prevent the secession of the union during the civil war to china s approach to taiwan it sees the island as integral to its territory bloomberg reported american friends told me that abraham lincoln was the greatest american president because he led the country to victory in the civil war and prevented the secession of the u s wei said on sunday at the shangri la dialogue a security conference in singapore the u s is indivisible so is china china must be and will be reunified tensions over taiwan have escalated in recent months with the us regularly sailing warships through the taiwan strait gold backed asian currency china has recently taken steps towards moving away from the us dollar as the world s reserve currency in may 2018 the country launched a shanghai based oil futures contract denominated in the national currency the yuan or renminbi and backed by gold the oil futures contract would be a way for oil producers like saudi arabia to circumvent the us petrodollar which derives much of its value by being the currency used to buy and sell oil currency observers say the oil futures contract is a way for china to challenge the petrodollar and to set the stage for the yuan as the world s dominant currency later in 2018 china announced that it signed a c ross border pact with russia to work out a new payments system the idea being that national currencies could be used in bilateral trade to cut out the us dollar and thereby allow russia to bypass us sanctions and china to get around us tariffs the malaysian prime minister has taken this idea a step further in suggesting a common asian currency presumably similar to the euro of the european union last week prime minister mahathir mohamad said common currency for east asia could be pegged to gold and used for settling imports and exports though not for domestic transactions the concept was a reaction to what mohamad said was the manipulation of local currencies by external factors and came on the heels of a statement by the trump administration that included malaysia among nine countries to watch for currency manipulation peak gold at ahead of the herd among the reasons we like gold as an investment is that gold companies are finding less of it last month anglogold ashanti announced plans to sell its last remaining gold mine in south africa the mponeng mine southwest of johannesburg due to ore depletion we are now facing peak gold where gold production from here on will keep falling the experts agree the industry is seeing a significant slowdown in the number of large deposits being discovered it used to be that major gold miners were looking at 5 million ounce projects to buy and develop now they d be happy with a million ozs in the ground one of the most well respected ceos in the industry mark bristow who headed randgold before it merged with barrick remarked on the tight gold supply in a recent interview with the northern miner asked to comment on how the gold industry could look in five to 10 years bristow had this to say the industry is in decline we ve got ourselves into a really tight spot because we haven t invested in exploration and our future now when you look at the average life of mine it s less than the time it takes to discover and develop a world class asset the supply side of our industry is very tight the demand side and i disagree with some of the talk presenters here today in that gold is an inelastic industry just like everything else when we overdid the hedging and dumped twice as much gold into the market that we were actually producing the gold price went to us 255 an ounce we stopped doing it and it started going up the chinese started buying gold and it went even further then all we did is we took lower and lower grades and produced more and more gold and we put a roof a ceiling on the gold price and we ve driven it down since then to a point now where we are staring at tightening in the market conclusion the result as we see it has to be continuing strength in the gold price with major producers like anglogold ashanti seeing the end of gold mining in south africa a lack of discoveries in recent years and as bristow points out the length of time needed to build a gold mine these days being longer than the time it takes to mine it out that s really something when you think about it the lives of gold mines have become so short it takes longer to discover one and put it into production than the time from the onset of mining to closure combine these supply factors with the demand side reasons for owning gold right now to recap they include the series of economic indicators showing that us growth is grinding to a halt worsening yield curve inversion a potential trade spat with europe waiting in the wings as the us china trade war appears no closer to a resolution and the increasing tension between china and the us over taiwan and the south china sea raising the possibility of war and a flight to safe havens like gold and you have all the makings of a powerful and prolonged bull market for gold just as we are entering the most active time of the year for junior resource

growth in india is projected to accelerate to 7 5 in fy 2019 20 emerging and developing economy growth is constrained by sluggish investment and risks are tilted to the downside these risks include rising trade barriers renewed financial stress and sharper than expected slowdowns in several major economies the world bank says in its june 2019 global economic prospects heightened tensions subdued investment structural problems that misallocate or discourage investment also weigh on the outlook stronger economic growth is essential to reducing poverty and improving living standards said world bank group president david malpass current economic momentum remains weak while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing economies are holding countries back from achieving their potential it s urgent that countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate and attract investment they also need to make debt management and transparency a high priority so that new debt adds to growth and investment growth among advanced economies as a group is anticipated to slow in 2019 especially in the euro area due to weaker exports and investment u s

lowering extreme poverty under 3 percent by 2030 will remain unreachable analytical sections address key current topics government debt has risen substantially in emerging and developing economies as hard won cuts in public debt ratios prior to the financial crisis have to a large extent been reversed emerging and developing economies need to strike a careful balance between borrowing to promote growth and avoiding risks associated with excessive borrowing growth rates in low income countries are expected to rise to 6 in 2020 from 5 4 in 2019 but that is still not enough to substantially reduce poverty while a number of low income countries progressed to middle income status between 2000 and 2018 the remaining low income countries face steeper challenges to achieving similar progress many are poorer than the countries that made the leap to higher income levels and are fragile disadvantaged by geography and heavily reliant on agriculture investment growth among emerging and

growth is necessary to meet key development goals business climate reforms can help encourage private investment sharp currency depreciations are more common in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies and central banks are often required to respond to these fluctuations to maintain price stability the exchange rate pass through to inflation is more limited when central banks pursue credible inflation targets operate within a flexible exchange rate regime and are independent of the central government in the current environment of low global interest rates and weak growth

us economic and political actions against china and russia are likely driving the two countries closer analysts say hong kong china while much of the western media have been scrutinising the so called special relationship between the united states and the united kingdom this week as their leaders met in london another close and growing geopolitical and economic bond is receiving relatively little attention china s president xi jinping is in russia on a state visit to meet his counterpart vladimir putin just as both countries feel the long arm of us trade and foreign policy hurting their interests on a personal level xi and putin seem to have a very special relationship indeed in an interview with russia s state tass news agency xi said i have had closer interactions with president putin than with any other foreign colleagues he is my best and bosom friend i cherish dearly our deep friendship the two countries have long supported one another in the international political arena at the united nations on syria and iraq for instance xi s visit marks 70 years of diplomatic ties between them but much of the focus of xi s latest visit is on their growing economic relationship xi will attend the 23rd st petersburg international economic forum its theme this year is creating a sustainable development agenda and he is expected to deliver a speech on china s important proposals in the field of sustainable development which includes advocating multilateralism and improving global governance agathe demarais global forecasting director at the economist intelligence unit eiu says three issues are likely to dominate xi s meetings in russia north korea with which both russia and china have a particular relationship russia s energy exports to china in particular through the power of siberia gas pipeline that is being constructed in western siberia and the respective relations of russia and china with the us both russia and china are facing economic challenges on tuesday the world bank lowered its growth forecast for russia for 2019 to 1 2 percent down from 1 4 percent the us has led international sanctions against russia over its military actions in ukraine but falling oil production and slowing bank lending are having the biggest impact on its economy according to the world bank meanwhile tit for tat punitive trade tariffs between china and the us have hurt the confidence of businesses and consumers in china a mutual rival some analysts say the us s actions are likely driving china and russia closer together policymakers in both countries have actively tried to strengthen trade ties in recent years and it s no coincidence that this surge in russia china trade has come at the same time that the us has tightened sanctions on russia and concerns about the us china trade war have intensified liam carson emerging europe economist at capital economics told al jazeera there has been a marked increase in trade between russia and china over the past couple of years the value of russia s exports to china doubled between 2016 and 2018 while that was due partly to higher oil prices flattering the value of exports non oil exports also rose by almost 50 percent over this period said carson bilateral trade topped us 108bn last year a record high spurred in part by china s need to find new markets for products as the trade war with the us rages according to data from china s national bureau of statistics chinese exports to russia jumped 9 1 percent in 2018 to 316 7bn chinese yuan 45 8bn while imports from russia rocketed 39 4 percent to 390 9bn yuan 56 5bn the total value of china s imports from russia rose faster than those of any other top trade partner in 2018 but they still account for relatively small proportions of one another s trade all told 1 9 percent of all chinese exports went to russia in 2018 and russia accounted for 2 8 percent of chinese imports by comparison chinese imports from the us fell 2 3 percent to 1 019 5bn yuan 147 3bn while exports to the us rose 8 6 percent in 2018 from a year earlier to 3 160 3bn 456 5bn bruno sergi an author and professor of russian and chinese political economy at harvard university believes that a bolstered trade relationship will lead to an informal alliance in deeper hi tech cooperation and a new strategic alignment it is fair to assume that the key topics of discussion will be the issues of keeping the stability and increasing the volume of foreign trade turnover of russia and china implementing joint fuel and energy projects etc probably standard solutions will be searched for and prospects for cooperation in the green economy and environmental protection will be discussed sergi told al jazeera though sergi thinks the oil and natural gas industry is part of the story he feels this will not tie xi and putin into an international treaty any time soon common ground china and russia have had a complicated relationship in the past they fought a brief border war in 1969 but they have been drawing closer in recent years as their interests converge sergi says there is no doubt that the two countries are closer together now than over the past few decades he points to a recent agreement to make it easier to transport goods across their land border as a major achievement in this regard russia and china are likely to boost technology cooperation and use china s belt and road initiative a series of land and maritime infrastructure projects stretching from asia to europe to facilitate future tie ups says sergi the presence of a shared adversary has been a key factor in their renewed economic cooperation analysts say i think that the aggravation of us china relations objectively pushes russia and the to cooperate more closely with each other and in the conditions of today s confrontation china and russia have the opportunity to improve economic ties sofya bakhta marketing strategy analyst for daxue consulting told al jazeera bakhta believes the trade war challenges china s development in the areas of economic energy and food security and it is in these areas that moscow and beijing can strengthen cooperation but not everyone is convinced that china s and russia s troubles with the us are pulling the cold war allies closer despite headlines russia s much trumpeted pivot towards asia is so far not taking place with little energy supplied by russia to asian countries and low levels of russian exports to china china absorbs 10 9 percent of russia s exports a far lower share than the eu said the eiu s demarais conversely china does not appear to prioritise cementing its relations with russia which it sees as a junior partner partly for fear of further antagonising the us she does however think one field where relations are evolving is in foreign exchange transactions russia was one of the first countries in the world to ink a currency swap agreement with china in 2014 for an amount of 24 5bn such an agreement makes it possible for russia and china to conduct trade directly in renminbi and rubles without having to use a third currency such as the us dollar such an agreement aims at strengthening trade ties it also preempts potential us sanctions that target payments in us dollars said demarais nuclear energy is another area where the two are helping one another this was underlined during the china russia summit in early june 2018 when rosatom the russian state owned nuclear energy company signed four new nuclear power agreements one of the largest deals in sino russian nuclear cooperation said demarais

illustration by melinda beck a version of this article appeared in the autumn 2019 issue of strategy business for the last 70 years the world has done remarkably well according to the world bank the number of people living in extreme poverty today is less than it was in 1820 even though the world population is seven times as large this is a truly remarkable achievement and it goes hand in hand with equally remarkable overall advances in wealth scientific progress human longevity and quality of life but the organizations that created these triumphs the most prominent businesses governments and multilateral institutions of the post world war ii era have failed to keep their implicit promises as a result today s leading organizations face a global crisis of legitimacy for the first time in decades their influence and even their right to exist are being questioned businesses are also being held accountable in new ways for the welfare prosperity and health of the communities around them and of the general public pwc s own global network of firms is among these businesses the accusations facing any individual enterprise may or may not be justified but the broader attitudes underlying them must be taken seriously the causes of this crisis of legitimacy have to do with five basic challenges affecting every part of the world asymmetry wealth disparity and the erosion of the middle class wealth disparity and the erosion of the middle class disruption abrupt technological changes and their destructive effects abrupt technological changes and their destructive effects age demographic pressures as the average life span of human beings increases and the birth rate falls demographic pressures as the average life span of human beings increases and the birth rate falls populism growing populism and rejection of the status quo with associated nationalism and global fracturing growing populism and rejection of the status quo with associated nationalism and global fracturing trust declining confidence in the prevailing institutions that make our systems work we use the acronym adapt to list these challenges because it evokes the inherent change in our time and the need for institutions to respond with new attitudes and behaviors a few other challenges such as climate change and human rights issues may occur to you as equally important they are not included in this list because they are not at the forefront of this particular crisis of legitimacy in the same way but they are affected by it if leading businesses and global institutions lose their perceived value it will be harder to address every other issue affecting the world today ignoring the crisis of legitimacy is not an option not even for business leaders who feel their primary responsibility is to their shareholders if we postpone solutions too long we could go past the point of no return the cost of solving these problems will be too high brexit could be a test case the costs and difficulties of withdrawal could be echoed in other political breakdowns around the world and if you don t believe that widespread economic and political disruption is possible right now then consider the other revolutions and abrupt dramatic changes in sovereignty that have occurred in the last 250 years often with technological shifts and widespread dissatisfaction as key factors what then would it take to rebuild the credibility of the important businesses of the world and other critical multilateral institutions so that they retain enough legitimacy to not just survive but participate as leaders in solving the world s urgent problems as business leaders we must accept our responsibility for helping to solve these problems we must recognize that the solutions are neither easy nor obvious and that they will require a fundamental shift in thinking we need to recognize the factors that generated the problems how they emerged as the unintended consequences of successful business and political practices why they have been ignored for so long and how to come to terms with addressing them asymmetry prosperity derailed the city of hamilton ontario gained its prosperity from steel mills opened in the early 1900s they were a constant source of good wages for industrial workers who could afford small houses nearby and who expected their children to attend college and live better lives than they had hamilton s two global steelmaking companies stelco and dofasco supported a vibrant community with a major university mcmaster and a renowned medical school if you don t believe that widespread economic and political disruption is possible right now then consider the revolutions that have occurred in the last 250 years but after the fall of the berlin wall in 1990 canada s steel industry collapsed mill workers had trouble finding new jobs and the work they found was often lower paid their neighborhoods have since become less desirable their children s prospects bleaker however today entrepreneurs in higher tech industries in hamilton are doing better than ever and the area s wine region is thriving hamilton is a microcosm of the economic challenges facing us not just in industrialized countries such as canada but everywhere wealth disparity is increasing the world s assets are now concentrated in the hands of a small number of people as the gap widens the average wealth and purchasing power of the middle class erodes this may be more obvious in the oecd organisation for economic cooperation and development countries where the size of middle income groups those with a household net income that is between 0 75 and two times the median has consistently decreased since 1988 but it is also true of major emerging economies such as china and india where the urban middle class has not kept pace with those at the top of the pyramid and is even at risk of slipping back according to the crowdsourced cost of living database numbeo a number of cities in emerging economies have extremely high ratios of average housing price to average annual income these include algiers beijing caracas guangzhou kathmandu mumbai phnom penh shanghai shenzhen and tehran in the world as a whole less than 1 percent of the adults hold more than 45 percent of the wealth between 2008 and 2018 the number of billionaires more than doubled from 1 125 to 2 754 two main factors have driven economic asymmetry the shift of work from high wage to lower wage countries due to globalization and automation and the growing amount of wealth including that generated by productivity gains captured by shareholders instead of employees both factors have had a host of secondary effects often showing up as disparities between capital holders and wage earners analysis by the international labour organization pdf has found that in 52 high income countries average labor productivity and thus typically profits grew nearly 17 percent from 1999 to 2015 while real wages grew only about 13 percent over time wealthy investors have used their leverage to widen the gap still further for instance they have moved away from the public capital markets to private equity hedge funds and syndicates these vehicles tend to give better returns but are open only to accredited investors meanwhile the prevailing shift in pension funds from defined benefit schemes which feature a monthly payment to defined contribution systems in which employees accrue a lump sum to live on after retirement has left many middle class people dependent on the stock market for their old age which is less advantaged and thus less capable of supporting them other effects of asymmetry reinforce the trend exacerbating the damage it does for example rising house prices will prevent many middle class people currently under the age of 40 from buying homes in their lifetime they will thus lose one of the main middle class means of accumulating wealth in australia according to theconversation com a site that reports on academic research homeownership by 25 to 34 year olds fell from 61 percent to 44 percent between 1981 and 2016 wealth disparity also challenges the ability of many governments to collect tax revenues and provide services the three most widely used forms of individual taxation are disproportionately low for those with extreme wealth they receive less of their wealth in salaries income tax consume relatively little in proportion to their wealth consumption tax and often live in residences owned by corporations real estate tax in addition in recent years technological advances have made it easier for high net worth individuals to move their money to low tax regimes thus as wealth disparity grows the availability of tax revenue shrinks just when more is needed finally economic asymmetry makes the middle class more vulnerable to other threats if automation takes middle class workers jobs away they have less of a cushion to fall back on while looking for work or developing new skills if storms and other extreme weather events related to climate change threaten their homes and livelihoods they are less likely to have insurance and more likely to lose any savings they have people also become more vulnerable to emotional problems when quality of life for the middle class declines in a seemingly never ending cycle people respond by losing hope in the rural u s in the last few years for example rates of excessive drinking drug overdoses and suicide have increased enough to shorten average life expectancy in the united states although much has been written about the effects of asymmetry it does not receive the attention it deserves among global business leaders that s in part because of the way economic success is most often measured through shareholder value for organizations and gdp for countries reliance on these two metrics has distorted our understanding of economic value they provide high level views of average prosperity gains that mask the disparities beneath disruption technology unbound a few years ago one of the remarkable success stories of china was the midsized city of kunshan just outside shanghai as recently as the late 1970s many of its people had lived in huts subsisting on the land or lakes then it became a manufacturing center known as little taiwan its factories attracted many workers from central and western china typically women chosen for their skill at small parts assembly they lived in large communal housing and sent much of their salary home kunshan ultimately developed one of the world s great universities and is launching many technology based startups it is now a thriving modern city with many cultural activities high quality infrastructure trees and flowers everywhere and a reputation as a foodie town but it is no longer a magnet for factory employees its plants are converting to robots this leaves many of kunshan s migrant employees with few options beyond returning home to an existence similar to the one they left behind the impact of technological disruption is just now becoming apparent to be sure it does have an extremely positive side advances in medicine materials science energy production and information technology have improved life in ways that might have been unimaginable in the early 1900s entrepreneurs have abandoned old business models to create powerful startups that generate great wealth and prosperity and improve the quality of life but disruption is also having severe effects on workers who face potential job losses from automation on governments which have to manage many new stresses and especially on existing businesses according to credit suisse the average life span of a standard poor s company has decreased since the 1950s from more than 60 years then to less than 20 years today is nothing new noted the bank s 2018 report on this theme what s new is the speed complexity and global nature of it most industries are adapting business leaders know they have to embrace new forms of digital technology and new platforms are emerging to help them do this solutions are being found for the challenges of artificial intelligence ai automation cyber attack intellectual property theft and the misuse of consumer data nonetheless these problems are so pervasive and daunting that many mainstream institutions still find them hard to manage which has exacerbated the loss of their credibility the worst effects are felt by established institutions whose reputations depend to some degree on public trust banks and financial services firms the media regulators schools the legal system and the police these institutions have generally been in existence for a long time and they were designed to change slowly to be solid reliable entities that could provide a sustained service to society professional journalists long supported by stable media funded through advertising and subscriptions are replaced by clickbait vendors on social media platforms who attract attention by telling people what they want to hear education must keep up with the demands for new skills and major changes in the way people receive information police are grappling with the task of preventing new forms of crime while also having their own actions captured on video and distributed digitally regulators and tax authorities are trying to catch up with radical new businesses that operate across a broad range of countries and industries to address the impact of technological disruption we will need to invest far more money time attention and knowledge in building the skills of the global workforce this will involve identifying the capabilities that companies and governments need and creating a culture of lifelong learning including for people who have not been used to it in many cases this challenge will bring together government industry and academic groups that have not worked together before the challenge of re skilling the planet is immense but the stakes could not be higher without the right talent the world s institutions will simply not be able to fulfill their purpose age demographics unresolved at japan s ministry of education senior officials tell a tale of woe shrinking enrollment competition for revenues from a declining tax base and a lack of jobs for teachers and university professors the average age in japan will be 53 in 2050 a function of declining fertility rates and increasing average life expectancy unless there is a significant unforeseen change the country can look ahead to overtaxed healthcare systems inadequate pensions and retirement savings and a relatively small workforce supporting a huge base of retirees get the strategy business newsletter delivered to your inbox sample email email address then there s india s ministry of education it s hard to believe it exists in the same world as japan s indian officials have proposed building 500 000 new schools over the next decade including at least 1 000 new universities to accommodate the country s burgeoning youthful population but they ll never get the approval the task would consume several times the government s entire budget instead the country will try to create between 10 million and 18 million new jobs a year at a time when many of its newly formed technology jobs such as call center staffing are being threatened by technological disruption and ai most countries today fall into one of two groups defined by their demographic problems old population societies such as japan china russia and most western european countries have too many aging people to sustain current workforce policies and pension systems their challenges are exacerbated by the medical and lifestyle related challenges of a longer life even the healthiest people over 65 require higher levels of medical expenditure and increases in chronic disease and lifelong obesity add dramatically to these costs it s not surprising that healthcare expenses per capita are rising at alarming rates throughout the developed world on the opposite end of the spectrum are young population societies india indonesia saudi arabia thailand most of africa much of latin america and many other emerging economies if they don t each generate at least hundreds of thousands of jobs per year for the next 10 years they will face an immense population of unrooted unsupported people most of these countries already have difficulties providing education and jobs for their young citizens and the challenge will get even more difficult as companies adopt automated manufacturing systems embedded with ai these countries won t be able to jump start their manufacturing industries as south korea and china did with low wage factory jobs because those jobs will be replaced by robots the tension raised by these soaring old and young populations can be summed up in a metric known as the age dependency ratio this is the percentage of people who cannot work and thus need economic support the figure is already almost double what it was in 1950 and is rising at an unprecedented rate see global age dependency ratio 1950 2050 these demographic issues are even more daunting when added to the negative consequences of asymmetry and disruption there is no clear view of how to design or fund an effective response and few institutions are confronting them with the requisite speed and creativity older countries may soon lose their capacity to support themselves and young countries will probably be overwhelmed by people looking for any way to make a living populism consensus fractured the week before the brexit vote in may 2016 a liverpool taxi driver told his u s passenger that he was voting to leave the european union he had grown up in liverpool he said but he no longer recognized the town two of his friends had given up their fishing business because of the catch limits imposed by the e u violent crime was increasing the pubs and restaurants he liked were closing he blamed all these shifts on decisions made in brussels his life was being changed he said by people he did not know whom he could not influence and who felt no accountability toward him my brexit vote is the most important decision of my life he said adding that he d studied the issue for a year then he summed up his opposition to the e u it s taxation and regulation without representation you started a revolution over this in america did you not when asked if he recognized the economic consequences of an exit he mused will it be worse than the second world war we survived that one the populist movement around the world is fueled by attitudes like this it should not be understood as allegiance to authoritarianism it is a basic combination of fear of future uncertainty and concerns about fairness when wages are stagnant for years the quality of life is poorer and the future is uncertain anxiety grows in the middle class people naturally experience their status and relevance as diminished and they worry that their children will be even worse off when the accumulation of great wealth in the hands of a few is conspicuous people perceive a basic lack of fairness in society they believe that institutions and political leaders are biased against them when uncertainty and unfairness are perceived as the overarching state of affairs people tend to vote more for populists and nationalists these political candidates seem to be the only ones who hear them as they want to be heard populist movements can lead politicians to support policies that often unintentionally have a chaotic effect on business for example they may involve retreating from global agreements governance structures and standards investment and innovation which rely on the free flow of ideas goods and people across boundaries are more difficult in the kind of closed border world favored by populism protectionist tariffs make it more difficult for businesses to compete and populism makes it increasingly difficult for global enterprises to defend or continue the international supply chain operations that have sustained them for decades the nationalist challenge has placed a burden of proof on global institutions to show that they are capable of answering the genuine demands that people have for a visibly better future no matter where they are located or what kind of work they do this will require sustainable solutions for several significant issues such as the growing number of weather related disasters the emotionally charged issue of immigration policy and the challenge of skill building solutions must come first only when fundamental issues are credibly understood and addressed will trust in society s institutions return we no longer live in a world in which movement toward liberal democracy and capitalism can be taken for granted it is doubtful that the world will return to a relatively simple global multilateral order there will be several competing political and economic models each dominant in a few regions the most influential large nations will have different views on how to compete economically on who should write the rules as in trade climate and financial regulation on how to share resources and on how to organize the interoperable platforms of digitally driven commerce the models may vary widely but they will also need to function effectively alongside one another the smaller countries will try to preserve their independence while navigating between these larger powers in the end the competition of ideas brought on by populism may be a blessing in disguise the older models are no longer perceived as advancing the common good and with luck new models will emerge that do a better job trust institutions disrespected in november 2018 when the group of 20 international forum g20 held its annual summit in buenos aires argentina a corruption scandal was dominating local headlines former argentine president cristina kirchner had been formally accused of being one of the leaders of a massive bribery network which included many of the country s business leaders a raft of similar cases had recently come to light starting in brazil and moving throughout latin america highlighted by a wave of media attention and facilitated by reforms in the criminal justice system the revelations were generally treated as damaging but not surprising commentators warned of indifference and scandal fatigue the average citizen in the region has long regarded corruption as a way of life feels little trust in government or other related institutions and assumes that no sustainable solution is likely latin america is not unique at a time of electronic media saturation and partisan political rancor when email hacks and political leaks occur regularly mistrust of institutions has become a worldwide phenomenon this has taken more of a toll than people realize the edelman trust barometer which has tracked the perception of institutional credibility since 2001 presents a sobering picture in 2019 the firm found a record high trust gap between the informed public and everyone else the first group college educated people age 25 to 64 in the top quarter of household income in their market reported significant engagement with news media and tended to have a positive view of society s institutions the rest of the population in aggregate was far more skeptical overall only about 20 percent of the entire global population said they felt the system was working for them institutions that have lost credibility are government corporations media schools and universities and religious organizations worse still a significant amount of the loss of trust reflects institutional bad behavior the 2008 financial crisis institutional leaks and a wide range of public disclosures of egregious acts have all contributed the net result is a broad body of people who do not trust any institution charged with shepherding their future consider for example france s yellow vest protests which began in opposition to a green fuel tax in the fall of 2018 no solution was considered sufficient because no one was trusted to deliver results without some trustworthy institutions civilization cannot fully function the sources of disruption themselves technology and social media are also increasingly seen as untrustworthy people are becoming preoccupied with privacy and security they see their personal data being stolen from sites they thought were secure learn of the manipulation of people through social media and find out about algorithms that facilitate the purchase of bomb materials without traceability as occurred in recent terrorist attacks in the united kingdom it s difficult to see how trust can be broadly restored but data from the edelman barometer offers some clues globally 75 percent of respondents trusted the enterprise they worked for a much higher figure than that for trust in media 47 percent government 48 percent business in general 56 percent or nongovernmental organizations 57 percent many of these respondents said they look to business as a catalyst for social change 71 percent agreed for example that it s critically important for my ceo to respond to challenging times to regain trust institutions have to be seen as functionally competent and as working for the common good schools businesses and governments are gradually learning what this means it means not just providing value to everyone who interacts with them but doing so in an engaging way so that the experience of interacting with them is welcome many efforts to do this in the past have been simplistic or insincere this time the stakes are high and halfhearted efforts will not suffice the lack of trust in organizations today is a sign that full scale renewal is needed as is a shift to a broader sense of purpose a catalyst for change if leaders are serious about restoring trust in mainstream institutions they have to think freshly about legitimacy and leverage many institutions day to day practices and ways of thinking have contributed to this crisis building trust requires changing habitual practices often at a large scale what are the fresh ideas for effectively addressing 21st century challenges we think these are the places to start take responsibility the issues described here are vast and it s easy to become inured to them but business leaders have to care about the results we need to create alternatives to a system that sets up new college graduates with massive personal debt and little opportunity that lets people retire broke with almost no safety net and that lets people in midcareer lose their jobs to automation and with them their homes and hope for their children s future we have to care about the middle class around the world to prevent it from being hollowed out we have to balance that with care about the poorest regions the regions at risk of drought flooding and neglect if we don t want these results funded in the long run by wealth redistribution we have to foster them in the short run through genuine commitment more effective management and smarter solutions move with rapid speed and at massive scale recognize the urgency and scope of the issues we must address we cannot take up time debating and conferring before acting for example finding education and work for 442 million people in africa over the next 10 years cannot be accomplished at the current pace of existing multinational institutions be local first in democratic systems international and national policy debates have become so polarized that we are unlikely to find the answers we need there nor can we fully trust authoritarian systems which have their own agendas during the next few years the most important role of international societies and national governments may be to step back and create the conditions that will allow local communities to thrive by solving problems they need to be set up to experiment pay attention to the results offer transparency and learn from their own experience and one another there is a better chance to build social cohesion and inclusive opportunity at the level of local communities if we can deploy our growing expertise to support them redefine success the prevailing economic focus on gdp growth and shareholder value has hidden the real harms people are experiencing national and global averages do not paint a full picture organizations must make decisions based on their more fundamental purpose to improve the world s value in human as well as economic terms they need to be held accountable to the success of the communities in which they operate countries need to refocus on overall societal well being and not just gdp growth humanize technology digital tools and media are unless programmed otherwise indifferent to their consequences it is up to people to ensure the effects are beneficial social media can produce accurate news technology can improve memory and attention and reduce depression and anxiety ai can replicate the best of us not the worst of us to ensure this happens we need more people to be digitally skilled and aware capable of driving better outcomes and more inclusive innovation reinvent our institutions tax systems can be made fairer capital markets can be made more accessible and effective educational systems can be brought up to date in both their methods and their curricula to instill the skills society needs we must engage our imagination to find new models of organizational practice and governance most of these new models involve new levels of transparency egregious practices which once seemed like they could be hidden will now be more likely to come to light rethink leadership perhaps most importantly we need to recognize the inherent paradoxes that leaders must navigate today to be technologically savvy and acutely focused on furthering humanity to heroically drive change but remain humble enough to recognize our limits to have the political skills to operate among diverse constituencies but not lose our integrity to prize that which came before and still drive massive innovation those who are followers members of businesses organizations and society should expect no less of their leaders everyone should recognize that at some moment in the near future each person will be called upon to lead in some small way these may seem like daunting or quixotic goals but they are achievable indeed many of them have matured in recent years away from earlier idealism and optimism and toward more pragmatic understanding but that too is reason for hope we don t know right now what solutions will work best for the crisis of legitimacy but we know that there will be great opportunities along with daunting challenges involved in finding out author profiles blair sheppard is

trade war unjustified china s rise no threat to us updated 2019 06 05 06 59 hk edition many hong kong economic analysts have tried to draw a parallel between the us trade war with japan in the 1980s and that washington is now having with china it s a futile exercise both academically and practically because there s just no parallel in the nature of the two conflicts and there s none in the challenges they each posed to hong kong in the 1980s hong kong was an emerging financial center in the region servicing its neighboring economies japan was one of the economies hong kong served but it wasn t a major banking customer there were also south korea indonesia and thailand where the demand for syndicated loans was large the japanese yen s appreciation against the greenback to which the hong kong dollar is pegged following the plaza accord in 1985 had the effect of pushing up prices of a wide range of consumer products imported from japan that had added to the inflation woes that afflicted many economies around the world but in hong kong the pain of inflation was largely mitigated by rising wages as the local economy was growing at a brisk pace while going through a transformation from one that was based on manufacturing to services the explosive demand for workers by the thriving services sector helped push up workers take home wages and gave them a strong sense of job security as such expectations of rising prices acted as a strong stimulant to consumer expenditure which helped generate economic growth at a time when exports of goods manufactured on the chinese mainland but routed through hong kong were also booming at that time the demand for financial services from hong kong was boosted by the need for japanese manufacturers who were moving part of their production to various low cost manufacturing bases in the region to enhance their competitiveness eroded by the strong yen this had also led many japanese banks and investment houses to expand overseas and many of them chose hong kong as their regional base the protracted trade row between the us and china is something that should never have happened in the 1980s japan posed a serious and existential threat to the core us industries in just a few years japanese car imports to the us threatened to destroy the then all important us auto industry raising questions about the durability of the us industrial might numerous papers and books were written portraying the demise of the us as an economic power being relegated to a raw material supplier to feed the industries of japan the very mention of the all conquering japan inc struck terror in the minds of many us economic planners at that time the rise of china poses no such threats to the us to be sure us trade deficit with the chinese mainland may look large but it s insignificant when taken in the context of the overall economy indeed foreign trade accounts only for a relatively minor share of total us economic output compared to domestic consumption what s more chinese mainland exports to the us consist mainly of light industrial consumer products most of which are too costly to be manufactured in the us the demise of heavy industries in the rust belt of the us mid west states has little or nothing to do with chinese imports irrational as it is the trade dispute instigated by the us against the chinese mainland is exacting a heavy price on hong kong the direct cost may seem minimal confining to a fall in trade throughput which accounts for a diminishing share of the total economy but the magnitude of the indirect cost is harder to ascertain on the currency front the appreciation of the us dollar against the chinese yuan has triggered speculation among some international currency traders that the hong kong dollar which is pegged to the us dollar is becoming increasingly overvalued at the time when the local economy which is closely integrated to that of the mainland s is troubled by the trade stand off such disparity could force banks to raise local interest rates which are lagging behind that of the us a sudden surge in interest rates could send the nervous asset markets into a tailspin the stock market has been moving listlessly in the past several weeks while maintaining a downward trend the property market boom in the past few months has fizzled out as potential home buyers and investors are staying on the sidelines watching the unfolding drama served up by the trade dispute the sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter of this year was largely seen as a reflection of the decline in demand for financial and trade services from hong kong the second quarter s performance is widely expected to remain depressed the impact of the trade tensions between the world s two largest economies is nothing hong kong has ever seen before the author is a current affairs commentator hk edition 06 05 2019 page9

the u s federal debt has more than doubled since the 2008 financial crisis shooting up from 9 4 trillion in mid 2008 to over 22 trillion in april 2019 the debt is never paid off the government just keeps paying the interest on it and interest rates are rising in 2018 the fed announced plans to raise rates by 2020 to normal levels a fed funds target of 3 375 percent and to sell about 1 5 trillion in federal securities at the rate of 50 billion monthly further growing the mountain of federal debt on the market when the fed holds government securities it returns the interest to the government after deducting its costs but the private buyers of these securities will be pocketing the interest adding to the taxpayers bill in fact it is the interest not the debt itself that is the problem with a burgeoning federal debt the principal just gets rolled over from year to year but the interest must be paid to private bondholders annually by the taxpayers and constitutes one of the biggest items in the federal budget currently the fed s plans for quantitative tightening are on hold but assuming it follows through with them projections are that by 2027 u s taxpayers will owe 1 trillion annually just in interest on the federal debt that is enough to fund president donald trump s trillion dollar infrastructure plan every year and it is a direct transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy investors holding most of the bonds where will this money come from crippling taxes wholesale privatization of public assets and elimination of social services will not be sufficient to cover the bill bondholder debt is unnecessary the irony is that the united states does not need to carry a debt to bondholders at all it has been financially sovereign ever since president franklin d roosevelt took the dollar off the gold standard domestically in 1933 this was recognized by beardsley ruml chairman of the federal reserve bank of new york in a 1945 presentation before the american bar association titled taxes for revenue are obsolete the necessity for government to tax in order to maintain both its independence and its solvency is true for state and local governments he said but it is not true for a national government the government was now at liberty to spend as needed to meet its budget drawing on credit issued by its own central bank it could do this until price inflation indicated a weakened purchasing power of the currency then and only then would the government need to levy taxes not to fund the budget but to counteract inflation by contracting the money supply the principal purpose of taxes said ruml was the maintenance of a dollar which has stable purchasing power over the years sometimes this purpose is stated as the avoidance of inflation the government could be funded without taxes by drawing on credit from its own central bank and since there was no longer a need for gold to cover the loan the central bank would not have to borrow it could just create the money on its books this insight is a basic tenet of modern monetary theory the government does not need to borrow or tax at least until prices are driven up it can just create the money it needs the government could create money by issuing it directly or by borrowing it directly from the central bank which would create the money on its books or by taking a perpetual overdraft on the treasury s account at the central bank which would have the same effect the power revolution transferring the money power to the banks the treasury could do that in theory but some laws would need to be changed currently the federal government is not allowed to borrow directly from the fed and is required to have the money in its account before spending it after the dollar went off the gold standard in 1933 congress could have had the fed just print money and lend it to the government cutting the banks out but wall street lobbied for an amendment to the federal reserve act forbidding the fed to buy bonds directly from the treasury as it had done in the past the treasury can borrow from itself by transferring money from intragovernmental accounts social security and other trust funds that are under the auspices of the treasury and have a surplus but these funds do not include the federal reserve which can lend to the government only by buying federal securities from bond dealers the fed is considered independent of the government its website states the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities are categorized as held by the public because they are not in government accounts according to marriner eccles chairman of the federal reserve from 1934 to 1948 the prohibition against allowing the government to borrow directly from its own central bank was written into the banking act of 1935 at the behest of those bond dealers that have an exclusive right to purchase directly from the fed a historical review on the website of the new york federal reserve quotes eccles as stating i think the real reasons for writing the prohibition into the can be traced to certain government bond dealers who quite naturally had their eyes on business that might be lost to them if direct purchasing were permitted the government was required to sell bonds through wall street middlemen which the fed could buy only through open market operations purchases on the private bond market open market operations are conducted by the federal open market committee fomc which meets behind closed doors and is dominated by private banker interests the fomc has no obligation to buy the government s debt and generally does so only when it serves the purposes of the fed and the banks rep wright patman chairman of the house committee on banking and currency from 1963 to 1975 called the official sanctioning of the federal open market committee in the banking laws of 1933 and 1935 the power revolution the transfer of the money power to the banks patman said the open market is in reality a tightly closed market only a selected few bond dealers were entitled to bid on the bonds the treasury made available for auction each week the practical effect he said was to take money from the taxpayer and give it to these dealers feeding off the real economy that massive wall street subsidy was the subject of testimony by eccles to the house committee on banking and currency on march 3 5 1947 patman asked eccles now since 1935 in order for the federal reserve banks to buy government bonds they had to go through a middleman is that correct eccles replied in the affirmative patman then launched into a prophetic warning stating i am opposed to the united states government which possesses the sovereign and exclusive privilege of creating money paying private bankers for the use of its own money i insist it is absolutely wrong for this committee to permit this condition to continue and saddle the taxpayers of this nation with a burden of debt that they will not be able to liquidate in a hundred years or two hundred years the truth of that statement is painfully evident today when we have a 22 trillion debt that cannot possibly be repaid the government just keeps rolling it over and paying the interest to banks and bondholders feeding the financialized economy in which money makes money without producing new goods and services the financialized economy has become a parasite feeding off the real economy driving producers and workers further and further into debt in the 1960s patman attempted to have the fed nationalized the effort failed but his committee did succeed in forcing the central bank to return its profits to the treasury after deducting its costs the prohibition against direct lending by the central bank to the government however remains in force the money power is still with the fomc and the banks a model we can no longer afford today the debt growth model has reached its limits as even the bank for international settlements the central bankers bank in switzerland acknowledges in its june 2016 annual report the bis said that debt levels were too high productivity growth was too low and the room for policy maneuver was too narrow the global economy cannot afford to rely any longer on the debt fueled growth model that has brought it to the current juncture the bis warned but the solutions it proposed would continue the austerity policies long imposed on countries that cannot pay their debts it prescribed prudential fiscal and above all structural policies structural readjustment that means privatizing public assets slashing services and raising taxes choking off the very productivity needed to pay the nations debts that approach has repeatedly been tried and has failed as witnessed for example in the devastated economy of greece meanwhile according to minneapolis fed president neel kashkari financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government bailout only modestly from 84 percent to 67 percent that means there is still a 67 percent chance of another major systemwide crisis and this one could be worse than the last the biggest banks are bigger local banks are fewer and global debt levels are higher the economy has farther to fall the regulators models are obsolete aimed at a form of old fashioned banking that has long since been abandoned we need a new model one designed to serve the needs of the public and the economy rather than to maximize shareholder profits at public expense this article is excerpted from my new book

slash global economic output by 0 5 per cent in 2020 the international monetary fund warned as world finance leaders prepare to meet in japan this weekend imf managing director christine lagarde said in a blog and briefing note for g20 finance ministers and central bank governors that taxing all trade between the two countries as president donald trump has threatened would cause some us455 billion in gross domestic product to evaporate a loss larger than g20 member south africa s economy these are self inflicted wounds that must be avoided lagarde said in an imf blog post how by removing the recently implemented trade barriers and by avoiding further barriers in whatever form the imf said that us tariffs and chinese retaliatory measures put in place thus far including a recent increase in us tariffs to 25 per cent on a us200 billion list of chinese imports could cut 2020 growth by 0 3 per cent more than half of that impact comes from negative effects on business confidence and

yves here randy wray has an important post on how contrary to the views of some pundits japan isn t following mmt principles particularly with prime minister abe raising the sales tax when japan has a negative policy interest rate however and i hope people who are more current on japan would pipe in it s not clear that it is all that easy to do what mmt proponents advocate which is to stimulate consumption japan has been trying to do that since the mid 1980s with not much success admittedly more government net spending would improve the labor market even though japan s headline unemployment rate is 3 that figure masks considerable under employment and employment insecurity as an asahi shimbun article in the past week points out a significant portion of university graduates in the post crisis years of 1993 to 2004 wound up as freeters or temps even if they worked for long periods for a large company they were still second class citizens subject to reductions in hours and not integrated into the extremely important social fabric of the organization the asahi shimbun article says the government wants to do something the labor ministry compiled a package of policy measures may 29 to help people in their mid 30s to mid 40s the so called lost generation land stable employment millions of people in this age bracket failed to find regular work after they graduated from university or high school due to the slowdown triggered by the collapse of the asset inflated economy in the early 1990s the ministry said the next three years will be an intensive support period as it expands subsidies for companies that hire those in their middle 30s to middle 40s as regular employees it will also implement vocational training programs in cooperation with companies or local governments people who graduated from university or high school from around 1993 to 2004 faced extreme difficulty landing stable jobs now aged between 35 and 44 they number about 17 million in total of them 3 17 million are non regular workers and 520 000 people are freeters those who continue to work as part timers without landing regular work about 400 000 people are not looking for work as a pillar of support measures the ministry will set up vocational training courses so that trainees can obtain qualifications to secure stable jobs quickly courses will be offered through industry organizations covering industries such as construction transportation and agriculture which are all facing a shortage of workers the ministry will also make it easier for companies to apply for a subsidy of up to 600 000 yen 5 475 for offering regular work to those from the lost generation as a result of their unstable employment record many of those from the lost generation have also faced difficulties getting married low household formation isn t entirely due to the lousy state of the japanese economy parasite singles meaning women who deferred marriage by staying with their parents and often having some sort of paid work started in the bubble years of the 1980s they were arguably caught out by the crisis however i wonder even if the economy hadn t imploded how many would actually have gotten married later these women were seldom putting off getting married to pursue careers only in 1987 did japan require that companies hire women into a professional track as opposed to being tea ladies who were expected to get married my impression at sumitomo bank then is that very few women were hired for these positions and they were hazed badly by the men i can t prove it but i would hazard that a significant driver of the drop in the household formation rate was women not wanting to get married because they didn t like the deal successful men would work late all week and even on saturdays often coming home drunk they would bear all the childrearing duties as well as keeping up the household and cooking another reason it is hard to get japanese to consume more is that they live in cramped housing i visited two homes in japan which is a big honor one was of a sumitomo bank board member in hiroo garden hills super glam by virtue of having open space with trees and grass while being within the otemachi line as in central tokyo he had what looked like a 900 square foot apartment with a not large combined living dining room a small galley kitchen one bath and three barely bigger than tatami mat sized bedrooms it had simple and not fancy furniture and there would be no point in tarting it up since pretty much no one entertains at home the other residence i saw was of a billionaire client in nagoya it was a proper reasonable sized house maybe 2500 square feet with nicely proportioned rooms it was furnished traditionally which means hardly at all my client did show me his vault and some of his goyas but that was as far as his display went and buying goyas does not do much to stimulate the domestic economy by randy wray originally published at new economic perspectives in recent days the international policy making elite has tried to distance itself from mmt often going to hysterical extremes to dismiss the approach as crazy no one does this better than the japanese as mmt began to gather momentum its developers began to receive a flood of calls from reporters around the world enquiring whether japan serves as the premier example of a country that follows mmt policy recommendations my answer is always the same no japan is the perfect case to demonstrate that all of mainstream theory and policy is wrong and that it is the best example of a country that always chooses the anti mmt policy response to every ill that ails the country reporters find that shocking biggest government fiscal deficits in the developed country world check highest government debt ratios in the developed country world check isn t that what mmt advises no nay it is the perfect demonstration that all the mainstream bogeymen are false big deficits cause inflation no japan s inflation runs just above zero see graph big debts cause high interest rates no japan s policy rate is about 0 10 negative rates big debts cause bond vigilante strikes no japan s government debt is hoovered up as fast as it can be issued all the more true with the boj running qe and creating a scarcity in spite of the quadrillions of yen debt available critics of mmt counter that japan is proof that big deficits kill investment and growth well it is true that japan has been growing at just 1 per year certainly nothing to write home about however investment grows at about a 2 pace but is pulled down by lack of consumption growth which has averaged just about zero over the past few years yet unemployment clocks in at only 3 in spite of slow growth as the labor force shrinks due to an aging population per capita gdp has been stuck at about 38 000 for years not so bad but not growing and japan s current account surplus has surged from under 1 to 4 of gdp over the past few years considered to be good by most commentators unfortunately trump s trade war seems to have already hurt japan s exports and the prognosis for growth this year is rather dismal the april survey of consumer confidence showed it collapsing to the lowest level in three years from the mmt perspective what japan needs is a good fiscal stimulus albeit one that is targeted japan has three injections into the economy the fiscal deficit which has fallen from 7 of gdp to about 5 over the past few years still a substantial injection the current account surplus and private investment but what it needs is stronger growth of domestic consumer demand which would also stimulate investment directed to home consumption so fiscal policy ought to be targeted to spending that would increase economic security of japanese households to the point that they d increase consumer spending so what is prime minister abe s announced plan to raise the sales tax to squelch consumption and reduce economic growth you cannot make this up this has been japan s policy for a whole generation any time it looks like the economy might break out of its long term stagnation policy makers impose austerity in an attempt to reduce the fiscal deficit and thereby throw the economy back into its permanent recession clearly this is the precise opposite to the mmt recommendation and yet pundits proclaim japan has been following mmt policy all these years why because japan has run big fiscal deficits as if mmt s policy goal is big government deficits and debt ratios no we see the budget as a tool to pursue the public interest things like full employment inclusive and sustainable growth to be sure by many reasonable measures japan does ok in spite of policy mistakes certainly in comparison to the usa japan looks pretty good good and accessible healthcare low infant mortality long lifespans low measured unemployment and much less inequality and poverty but japan could do better if it actually did adopt the mmt view that the budgetary outcome by itself is not an important issue but no the japanese officials are falling all over themselves to make it clear that they will never adopt mmt finance minister taro aso called mmt an extreme idea and dangerous as it would weaken fiscal discipline one wonders how a reporter could listen to that without bursting out in laughter japan s fiscal discipline would be threatened by mmt the debt ratio is already approaching 250 by conventional measures japan has the worst fiscal discipline the world has ever seen but wait it gets even funnier boj policy board member yutaka harada kept up the attack on mmt the approach proposed by mmt will cause inflation for sure the boj has done everything it could think of for the past quarter century to get the inflation rate up to 2 quadrillions of qe negative interest rates and the boj thinks mmt could produce runaway inflation i doubt that even weimar s reichsbank could cause high inflation in japan ok that s a cheap shot at japan s policymakers what they do not understand is that there are two ways to produce a high deficit and debt ratio the ugly way and the good way mmt has been arguing this for a long time but with little progress in promoting understanding i think that the main reason is because we ve been using plain english economists are not good at reading for comprehension they need pictures and math perhaps the following will help yes i gave it a name there s the laffer curve the phillips curve and now the wray curve i didn t draw it on a cocktail napkin at a bar but rather jotted it down on a note pad before bed last night assume the economy is at point a for japan this would represent a 5 deficit ratio and a 1 rate of growth now pm abe imposes a consumption tax or the usa plummets into a downturn reducing japan s growth rate the economy moves up and to the left toward point b as growth slows and the deficit ratio rises slower growth reduces tax revenue even as it scares households and firms which reduce spending in an effort to build up savings the slower growth also reduces imports so the current account improves somewhat from the sectoral balance perspective the government s balance moves further into deficit to say a 7 fiscal deficit the current account surplus rises say from 4 to 5 and the private sector s surplus grows to 12 the sum of the other two balances that s the ugly way to increase a fiscal deficit it is the japanese way it is like a perpetual bleeding of the patient in the hope that further blood loss will cure her ills what is the mmt alternative measured and targeted stimulus designed to restore confidence of firms and households ramp up the social security safety net to assure the japanese people that they will be taken care of in their old age recreate a commitment to secure jobs and decent pay either promote births or encourage immigration to replace the declining workforce undertake a green new deal to transition to a carbon free future in that case we move along the curve from point a toward point c the fiscal deficit increases in the good way while growth improves note however that the boost to the deficit will only be temporary households and firms will begin to spend and their surplus will fall the current account surplus will fall too as imports rise tax revenues will increase not because rates rise but because income increases the fiscal deficit will fall as the domestic private surpluses decline precisely how much the deficit will fall depends on the movement of the private surplus and current account surplus with the deficit falling to equality with the sum in terms of the graph above the wray curve shifts out to the right point a will be consistent with a higher rate of growth for a given deficit ratio there s nothing natural about the deficit ratio at point a as it depends on the other two sectoral balances for the usa point a is consistent with a higher growth rate but probably a similar deficit ratio to that of japan our current account balance is of course negative which implies a higher fiscal deficit however our private sector s surplus is smaller than japan s for any given growth rate which implies a lower fiscal deficit the two essentially offset one another to leave the us deficit ratio at about 5 but with higher growth than japan note that we are not proposing a sort of reverse laffer curve recall that the laffer curve says that tax cuts more than pay for themselves trickle down growth boosts revenue sufficiently to close a fiscal deficit i am not arguing that the stimulative increase of government spending will increase tax revenue so much that the deficit ratio returns to its original level or less where it actually ends up depends on movements of the two other sectoral balances not that the size of the deficit by itself is important what is important is whether government budget policy helps in the pursuit of the public and private interests the deficit will always adjust to be just the right size to balance the other two sectoral balances but that equality can be consistent with any growth rate including a rate that is too low deflationary or too high inflationary and the sectoral balance equality holds with any fiscal deficit ratio so while it is likely that a successful stimulus will shift the wray curve out to the right we cannot predict exactly where the new fiscal deficit ratio will settle as the growth rate rises what is most important about this graph is the recognition that there are at least two different growth rates consistent with a given deficit ratio we can achieve a particular growth rate either in the ugly way or in the good way while generating the same deficit ratio japan continually operates its economy to produce ugly deficits precisely because it fears fiscal expansion for further discussion of fiscal deficits along these lines see the new textbook by mitchell wray and watts macroeconomics macmillan international red globe press chapter 8 and especially pp 124 128 note i am presuming that japan is unhappy with zero growth and that the country faces many unmet domestic needs i am not an advocate of growth for growth s sake especially in light of the growing recognition that humanity may well have only a decade or so left on planet earth unless we very quickly change our ways however changing our ways will require major investments in a japanese green new deal so even with zero growth there is a role for ramped up fiscal policy

million in fiscal 2017 the increase in wind business unit revenues was driven primarily by increased revenues from inox in india due to increased ecs shipments during fiscal 2018 inox has been active in the new central and state government auction regime in india and has over 900 mw of orders from the first four solar energy corporation of india limited seci central government auctions and 50 mw from the maharashtra state government auction however we cannot predict if and how successful inox will be in executing on these orders or in obtaining new orders under the new central and state auction regime any failure by inox to succeed under this regime or any delay in inox s ability to deliver its wind turbines could result in fewer ecs shipments to inox cost of revenues and gross margin cost of revenues decreased by 5 to 42 2 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 44 6 million in fiscal 2017 gross margin increased to 24 9 in fiscal 2018 from 7 8 in fiscal 2017 the increase in gross margin in fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by lower depreciation and reduced fixed factory overhead operating expenses research and development research and development r d expenses decreased by 15 to 9 9 million or 18 of revenue in fiscal 2018 compared to 11 6 million or 24 of revenue in fiscal 2017 the decrease in r d expenses is primarily the result of lower compensation cost due to decreased headcount selling general and administrative selling general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by 2 to 22 0 million or 39 of revenue in fiscal 2018 from 22 6 million or 47 of revenue in fiscal 2017 the decrease in sg a expenses is primarily the result of lower compensation cost due to decreased headcount gain on sinovel settlement we recorded a gain of 52 7 million net of legal and other direct costs in the year ended march 31 2019 as a result of the receipt of the payments from sinovel wind group co ltd sinovel required by the settlement agreement described further

acquisition of infinia technology corporation in 2017 the itc acquisition resulted in a loss of 0 1 million in fiscal 2017 the change in the fair value was primarily driven by the change in stock price from the acquisition date through the settlement date restructuring we recorded restructuring charges of 0 5 million in fiscal 2018 for facility exit costs and 1 5 million in fiscal 2017 which was comprised of 1 3 million severance pay as a result of the reduction in force announced on april 4 2017 and 0 2 million for facility exit costs resulting from the move of the corporate office

operating loss for fiscal 2018 is primarily due to lower depreciation and lower operating expenses compared to the prior year the wind segment generated operating income of 48 1 million in fiscal 2018 and an operating loss of 8 9 million in fiscal 2017 the increase in operating income for fiscal 2018 was due primarily to the receipt of the payments from sinovel required by the settlement agreement

income net other income net was 1 6 million in fiscal 2018 compared to other expense net of 2 8 million in fiscal 2017 the increase in other income net was due primarily to higher foreign currency gains in fiscal 2018 27 income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of 6 4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to an income tax benefit of 0 2 million in fiscal 2017 the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the repayment of previously reserved intercompany trade balances due to amsc austria from amsc china a dividend paid by amsc austria to the parent company following the sinovel settlement and deferred tax expense related to withholding taxes expected on future foreign dividends to the parent please refer to the risk factors section in part i item 1a for a discussion of certain factors that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition non gaap measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the non gaap measures included in this form 10 k however should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measure prepared in accordance with gaap we define non gaap net loss as net loss before gain on sale of minority investments gain on sinovel settlement net stock based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles consumption of zero cost basis inventory changes in fair value of warrants and contingent consideration non cash interest expense other non cash or unusual charges and the tax effect of adjustments indicated in the table below the tax effect of adjustments relates primarily to the gain on sinovel settlement net we believe non gaap net loss assists management and investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding these non cash charges and other items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance in addition we use non gaap net loss as a factor to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap net loss is set forth in the table below in thousands except per share data year ended march 31 2019 2018 net income loss 26 761 32 776 gain on sale of interest in minority investments 127 1 167 gain on sinovel settlement

in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in net income driven by higher revenues as well as lower depreciation and operating costs we define non gaap operating cash flow as operating cash flow before the gain on sinovel settlement net of legal fees and expenses tax effect of sinovel settlement net and other unusual cash flows or items we believe non gaap operating cash flow assists management and investors in comparing our operating cash flow across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding these non recurring cash items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating cash flow a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap operating cash flow is set forth in the table below in thousands march 31 2019 operating cash flow 42 714

operating losses and as of march 31 2019 had an accumulated deficit of 961 5 million in addition although we generated positive operating cash flows in the year ended march 31 2019 we have historically experienced recurring negative operating cash flows although our sales to inox increased in the year ended march 31 2019 compared to the year ended march 31 2018 we cannot predict if and how successful inox will be in executing on seci orders or in obtaining additional orders under the new central and state auction regime any failure by inox to succeed under this regime or any delay in inox s ability to deliver its wind turbines could result in fewer ecs shipments to inox our cash requirements depend on numerous factors including whether inox is successful under the new central and state auction regime as noted above the successful completion of our product development activities our ability to commercialize our reg system and ship protection system solutions rate of customer and market adoption of our products collecting receivables according to established terms and the continued availability of u s government funding during the product development phase of our superconductors based products we continue to closely monitor our expenses and if necessary expect to further reduce our operating and capital spending to enhance liquidity at march 31 2019 we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash of 78 2 million compared to 34 2 million at march 31 2018 an increase of 44 0 million our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash balance as of march 31 2019 reflects the 52 7 million in payments from sinovel under the settlement agreement as described above as of march 31 2019 we had approximately 31 6 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash in foreign bank accounts our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are summarized as follows in thousands march 31 march 31 2019 2018 cash and cash equivalents 77 483 34 084 restricted cash 715 165 total cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 78 198 34 249 net cash provided by used in operating activities was 42 7 million and 24 8 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due primarily to the receipt of the full amount of the sinovel settlement offset slightly by lower depreciation expense in fiscal 2018 net cash provided by investing activities was 2 2 million and 15 6 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due primarily to the proceeds from the sale of the devens property in fiscal 2017 with no similar transactions in fiscal 2018 net cash provided by used in financing activities was 0 3 million and 15 3 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the proceeds from our equity offering in fiscal 2017 and the lack of a similar offering in fiscal 2018 at march 31 2019 we had 0 7 million of restricted cash included in long term assets and at march 31 2018 we had 0 2 million of restricted cash included in long term assets these amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent deposits to secure surety bonds and letters of credit for various customer contracts these deposits are held in interest bearing accounts we believe we have sufficient available liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months in addition we may seek to raise additional capital which could be in the form of loans convertible debt or equity to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures our liquidity is highly dependent on our ability to increase revenues including our ability to collect revenues under our agreements with inox control our operating costs and our ability to raise additional capital if necessary there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all or execute on any other means of improving our liquidity as described above legal proceedings from time to time we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate if a matter is both probable to result in liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated we estimate and disclose the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements not misleading if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated a liability is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 29 off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec rules such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for the purpose of facilitating transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet except as discussed below we occasionally enter into construction contracts that include a performance bond as these contracts progress we continually assess the probability of a payout from the performance bond should we determine that such a payout is probable we would record a liability in addition we have various contractual arrangements under which we have committed to purchase certain minimum quantities of goods or services on an annual basis recent accounting pronouncements in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb issued accounting standards update asu 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 the guidance substantially converges final standards on revenue recognition between the fasb and iasb providing a framework on addressing revenue recognition issues and upon its effective date replaces almost all existing revenue recognition guidance including industry specific guidance in current u s generally accepted accounting principles the fasb has subsequently issued multiple amendments to asu 2014 09 which are all effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 as of april 1 2018 we have adopted asu 2014 09 and its amendments reported the impact in our consolidated financial statements and implemented changes to our business processes systems and controls to support revenue recognition and the related disclosures under this asu our assessment included a detailed review of representative contracts from each of our revenue streams and a comparison of our historical accounting policies and practices to the new standard we adopted the new standards retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the modified retrospective transition method to all existing contracts that have remaining obligations as of april 1 2018 accordingly we have elected to retroactively adjust only those contracts that do not meet the definition of a complete contract at the date of the initial application this guidance has led us to recognize certain revenue transactions sooner than in the past on certain contracts as we need to estimate the revenue we will be entitled to upon contract completion and later on other contracts such as consulting and statement of work transactions due to the lack of an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations satisfied over time there are no changes in the accounting for our largest revenue stream which includes inox wind ltd as our primary customer across other revenue streams such as d var equipment and d var turnkey the timing of revenue recognition will be affected for multiple types of contracts primarily multiple performance obligation contracts in our grid business unit but those differences did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements the adjustment to opening retained earnings was not significant for the period commencing on april 1 2018 additionally the adoption of this new standard did not have any tax impact on the consolidated financial statements as part of this analysis we evaluated our information technology capabilities and systems and did not incur significant information technology costs to modify systems currently in place in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016 01 financial instruments overall subtopic 825 10 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the amendments in asu 2016 01 enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision useful information this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years we adopted asu 2016 01 effective april 1 2018 and noted no significant impact to our consolidated financial statements in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 2016 02 leases topic 842 the guidance in this asu supersedes the leasing guidance in topic 840 leases under the new guidance lessees are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement this asu and its amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years in july 2018 the fasb issued asu 2018 10 codification improvements to topic 842 leases the amendments in asu 2018 10 provide more clarification in regards to the application and requirements of asu 2016 02 in july 2018 the fasb issued asu 2018 11 topic 842 leases targeted improvements the amendments in asu 2018 11 provide for the option to adopt the standard prospectively and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as well as offer a new practical expedient that will allow us to elect by class of underlying asset to not separate non lease and lease components in certain circumstances and instead to account for those components as a single item we have evaluated the provisions of asu 2016 02 and its amendments and assessed the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial position results of operations and disclosures this process has included identifying the implementation team applying the revised definition of a lease per accounting standards codification asc 842 to existing agreements and from that information creating an initial population we have made the policy election to exclude all leases shorter than 12 months from the recognition of the recording of the right of use rou asset and related liabilities we have elected the package of three practical expedients in regards to all leases that commenced before the effective date we made a policy election to not separate non lease and lease components for all asset classes the adoption of this guidance will result in certain changes to our financial statements to add the related asset and liability accounts for all of our operating leases we will continue to assess our agreements for any other impacts that may result from the adoption of this standard based on our analysis of our population of lease agreements we have determined that our initial population will be made up entirely of operating leases we have prepared control wording and are finalizing the overall lease policy as well as identifying and implementing changes necessary to comply with the provisions of asu 2016 02 30 asu 2016 02 became effective on april 1 2019 and we adopted the new

interim periods within those periods we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of asu 2018 13 may have on our consolidated financial statements we do not believe that other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material impact on our financial statements 31 critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions our accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates are as follows revenue recognition accounts receivable inventory valuation of long lived assets goodwill income taxes stock based compensation contingencies product warranty and fair value of financial instruments revenue recognition on april 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method therefore prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods the adoption of this guidance has led to recognizing certain revenue transactions sooner than in the past on certain contracts as we are required to estimate the revenue we will be entitled to upon contract completion and later on other contracts such as consulting and statement of work transactions due to the lack of an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations satisfied over time specifically in the technology product line revenue contracts are defined as an arrangement that creates enforceable rights and obligations of both parties where collection of the contract price is deemed probable we record revenue based on a five step model which includes identifying the performance obligations determining the transaction price allocating the contract transaction price to the performance obligations and recognizing the revenue when or as control of goods or services is transferred to the customer the transfer of control can occur at the time of delivery installation or post installation where applicable for certain arrangements such as contracts to perform research and development prototype development contracts and certain customized product sales we record revenues using the over time method measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs over time revenue recognition accounting is predominantly used on certain turnkey power systems installations for electric utilities and long term prototype development contracts with the u s government we follow this method when any of the three following criteria are met when the customer receives the benefits as they are performed control transfers to the customer as the work is performed or there is no alternative use to us and there is an enforceable right to payment through the life of the contract however the ability to reliably estimate total costs at completion is challenging especially on long term prototype development contracts and could result in future changes in contract estimates for contracts where reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs cannot be made we follow the point in time method we enter into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer sales of certain products may include extended warranty and support or service packages and at times include performance bonds as these contracts progress we continually assess the probability of a payout from the performance bond should we determine that such a payout is likely we would record a liability we would reduce revenue to the extent a liability is recorded in addition we enter into licensing arrangements that include training services performance obligations are separated into more than one unit of accounting when 1 the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and 2 our promise to transfer the goods or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract in general revenues are separated between the different product shipments which have stand alone value and the various services to be provided revenue for product shipments is generally recognized at a point in time where control of the product is transferred to the customer while revenues for the services are generally recognized over the period of performance we identify all goods and or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price ssp which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach for products and a relief from royalty method for licenses revenue allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when or as the performance obligation is satisfied we review ssp and the related margins at least annually our license agreements provide either for the payment of contractually determined paid up front license fees or milestone based payments in consideration for the grant of rights to manufacture and or sell products using our patented technologies or know how some of these agreements provide for the release of the licensee from past and future intellectual property infringement claims when we can determine that we have no further obligations other than the grant of the license and that we have fully transferred the technology know how we recognize the revenue under a point in time model in other license arrangements we may also agree to provide training services to transfer the technology know how in these arrangements we have determined that the licenses have no standalone value to the customer and are not separable from training services as we can only fully transfer the technology know how through the training component accordingly we account for these arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize revenue over the period of its performance using the over time method costs for these arrangements are expensed as incurred 45 existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors if it is determined that collectability of any portion of the contract value is not probable an analysis of variable consideration will be performed using either the most likely amount or expected value method to determine the amount of revenue that must be constrained until the scenario causing the variability has been resolved for contractual arrangements that involve variable consideration we recognize revenue for these amounts upon reaching the constraining event successfully we do not generally provide for extended payment terms or provide our customers with a right of return infrequently we receive requests from customers to hold product being purchased from us for a valid business purpose we recognize revenues for such arrangements provided the transaction meets at a minimum the following criteria a valid business purpose for the arrangement exists risk of ownership of the purchased product has been transferred to the buyer there is a fixed delivery date that is reasonable and consistent with the buyer s business purpose the product is ready for shipment we have no continuing performance obligation in regards to the purchased product and these products have been segregated from our inventories and cannot be used to fill other orders received there were no such transactions during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 such transactions recognized as revenue were 3 7 million we have elected to record taxes collected from customers on a net basis and do not include tax amounts in revenue or costs of revenue our contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations our accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances see note 3 revenue recognition for further information regarding the company s adoption of accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers accounts receivable accounts receivable consist of amounts owed by commercial companies and government agencies accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of customers as of march 31 2019 of our total receivable balance vestas accounted for approximately 21 and res system 3 llc accounted for approximately 16 with no other customers accounting for greater than 10 of the balance as of march 31 2018 of our total receivable balance inox accounted for approximately 32 and fuji bridex pte ltd accounted for approximately 17 with no other customers accounting for greater than 10 of the balance changes in the financial condition or operations of our customers may result in delayed payments or non payments which would adversely impact our cash flows from operating activities and or our results of operations as such we may require collateral advanced payment or other security based upon the customer history and or creditworthiness in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based primarily on the probability of recoverability based on historical collection and write off experience the age of past due receivables specific customer circumstances and current economic trends if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment additional allowances may be required failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 32 inventory inventories include material direct labor and related manufacturing overhead and are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in first out basis or net realizable value determined on a first in first out basis as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation we record inventory when we take delivery and title to the product according to the terms of each supply contract program costs may be deferred and recorded as inventory on contracts on which costs are incurred in excess of approved contractual amounts and or funding if future recovery of the costs is deemed probable at each balance sheet date we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence inventories that management considers excess or obsolete are reserved management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand competitiveness of product offerings market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established it is not written back up if demand increases we recorded inventory reserves of 0 9 million and 0 4 million during fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively based on evaluating our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence valuation of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets consisting principally of fixed and amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for the treatment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets or asset group that is held and used including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable under the held and used approach the asset or asset group to be tested for impairment should represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities the determination of our asset groups involves a significant amount of judgment assumptions and estimates we evaluate our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market and operational performance indicators of potential impairment include a significant change in the manner in which an asset group is used a significant decrease in the market value of an asset group identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit a significant adverse change in its business or the industry in which it is sold a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset group and significant advances in our technologies that require changes in our manufacturing process there were no indicators requiring further impairment testing on our long lived assets during the fiscal years ended march 31 2019 or 2018 33 goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated we perform our annual assessment of goodwill on february 28 of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether a triggering event has occurred often involves significant judgment from management an entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test the quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount we determine the fair value of a reporting unit based on an income approach utilizing a discounted cash flow adjusted for entity specific factors in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount an entity should consider the totality of all relevant events or circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss equal to the difference is recorded see note 4 acquisition and related goodwill for further information and discussion we performed our annual assessment of goodwill on february 28 2019 and noted no triggering events from the analysis date to march 31 2019 and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill income taxes our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse all deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as non current in the consolidated balance sheet we regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence both positive and negative and make significant judgments about many factors including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income based on all the available evidence we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realizable due to the taxable losses that have been incurred since our inception and uncertainty around our future profitability accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if based on the technical merits it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors including but not limited to changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision we include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes see note 13 income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our income tax assumptions and expenses on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the act was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code changes include but are not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 34 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 and a one time mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings we have calculated a provisional estimate of the impact of the act in our year end income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the act and guidance available as of the date of this filing see note 13 income taxes of our consolidated financial statements for the results of this assessment stock based compensation we measure compensation cost arising from the grant of share based payments to employees and non employees at fair value and recognize such cost over the period during which the employee and non employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period total stock based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal years ended march 31 2019 and 2018 was 3 0 million and 2 7 million respectively for awards with service conditions only we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service vesting period for awards with performance conditions accruals of compensation cost are made based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions the cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility management determined that expected volatility rates should be estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of our common stock the expected term represents the average time that the options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and our historical exercise cancellation and expiration patterns the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment as a result if circumstances change and we use different assumptions our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future in addition we are required to estimate an expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period see note 14 stockholders equity of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses our adoption of asu 2018 07 compensation stock compensation topic 718 improvements to non employee share based payment accounting on april 1 2018 resulted in the accounting for share based payments made to non employees to be accounted for in the same manner as other share based payments for employees with the measurement being based on the fair value at the grant date the non employee share based payments will be included within our stock compensation currently reported 34 contingencies from time to time we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated a liability is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements if with respect to a matter it is not both probable to result in liability and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated an estimate of possible loss or range of loss shall be disclosed unless such an estimate cannot be made we do not recognize gain contingencies until they are realized legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred see note 15 commitments and contingencies of our consolidated financial statements for further information product warranty warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of our products we generally provide a one to three year warranty on our products commencing upon installation the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products the accounting estimate related to product warranty involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable notes receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and warrants the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses due to their short term nature approximate fair value at march 31 2019 and 2018 the estimated fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources and management estimates notes receivable fair value has been estimated based on a present value calculation using current market information for a similar term loan with similar terms we have appropriately valued notes receivable within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy the fair value for the debt and warrant arrangements has been estimated by management based on the terms that we believe we could obtain in the current market for debt with the same terms and similar maturities the warrants are subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value will be recorded as a change in fair value in other expense income until the earlier of the warrants exercise or expiration we rely on assumptions used in a lattice model to determine the fair value of the warrants we have appropriately valued the warrants within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy

the new zealand dollar rose as the us dollar reached a seven week low and on the release of a speech a reserve bank official gave in tokyo last week in which he indicated that interest rates will probably be on hold for the foreseeable future the kiwi rose to 66 30 us cents at 5pm in wellington off the day s high at 66 36 immediately after assistant governor christian hawkesby s speech was released but up from 66 16 at 7 50am the trade weighted index rose to 72 71 points from 72 52 hawkesby told the bank of japan s institute for monetary and economic studies that the new monetary policy committee which has replaced the governor as the sole decision maker had considered a range of scenarios in may before deciding to cut the official cash rate by 25 basis points to a record low of 1 5 percent those scenarios assessed over a seven day period leading up to the official announcement on may 8 ranged from holding the ocr steady to cutting it by 75 basis points over 12 months if rates had remained unchanged the projections suggested that it would have taken a number of years for inflation to return to target and employment would have fallen below the maximum sustainable level hawkesby said if it had lowered the ocr by about 75 basis points over the next 12 months the projections suggested it would result in a situation where both inflation and employment would be overshooting their targets he said tim kelleher head of institutional foreign exchange sales at asb bank says the market was blind sided by the release of hawkesby s remarks especially because they were delivered on may 30 it was quite strange we thought our view on it is maybe they were trying to dampen down expectations of more than one rate cut kelleher says noting that the speech hadn t been flagged as the central bank normally does with important speeches they don t do themselves any favours on the communication front driving the us dollar lower and therefore driving other currencies higher against it federal reserve chair jerome powell said in a speech in chicago that the fed is watching economic developments including president donald trump s threat to impose tariffs on all mexican imports the fed is ready to keep the near record us expansion going including cutting interest rates powell said in prepared remarks we are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the us economic outlook and as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labour market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective kelleher says it will be a matter of watching developments and the data i don t think there s anything revolutionary about a fed chair saying he would act to protect the us economy at least they ve got some ammo they wouldn t have any ammo if they hadn t been tightening the fed funds rate is currently targeting 2 25 2 5 percent after lifting that target four times in 2018 financial markets have priced in two cuts from the fed by the end of the year the new zealand dollar was trading at 94 74 australian cents from 94 56 at 52 18 british pence from 52 04 at 58 87 euro cents from 58 72 at 71 65 yen from 71 48 and at 4 5825 chinese yuan from 4 5684 the new zealand two year swap rate edged down to 1 3880 percent from 1 4081 yesterday while the 10 year swap rate nudged up to 1 9000 percent from 1 8950 businessdesk comments from our readers no comments yet add your comment your name your email not displayed to the public comment comments to sharechat go through an approval process comments which are defamatory abusive or in some way deemed inappropriate will not be approved it is allowable to use some form of non de plume for your name however we recommend real email addresses are used comments from free email addresses such as gmail yahoo hotmail etc may not be approved anti spam verification type the text you see in the image into the field below you are asked to do this in order to verify that this enquiry is not being performed by an automated process related news skc resignation of coo australia and interim appointment hgh meets challenger bank milestone nz 210m equity raise april 8th morning report being ai limited trade with caution statement fletcher building executive team announcement manawa energy appoints gm market operations gm people april 5th morning report paysauce quarterly market update march 2024 april 3rd morning report bank of china new zealand limited director change

source benutzer zaufatch accessed in wikimedia commons june 4 marked the 30th anniversary of the chinese government s crackdown on and massacre of tiananmen square protestors and innocent bystanders that anniversary comes this year in the midst of the worst spate of trade tensions between china and the united states since the u s established diplomatic relations with china and china began its reform and opening policies those policies and u s china relations have anniversaries to celebrate this year as well both were announced in december 1978 so we re just halfway through the 40th anniversary year marking the process that gradually transformed china from an industrializing but poor centrally planned economy into a hybrid market cum state economy belonging to the ranks of the world s high middle income countries a world bank classification which china shares with countries like brazil mexico and malaysia reform and opening in china were but a decade old when the tiananmen violence occurred china s new economic strategy the communist party s declaration with tanks and bullets that the reform was to be economic only and today s trade war are all parts of one piece first we can set a few things straight china was not entirely an economic basket case in 1979 when it moved from its about face of being on the left of the soviet union with respect to egalitarianism and suppression of market forces to embracing those forces as key to a new socialism with chinese characteristics the best available estimates suggest that its total output value grew at about 6 per year between 1952 and 1979 with heavy industrial output growing much faster than consumer goods non staple crops and services comparisons indicate that despite the numerous policy swings between ultra leftists supported by mao zedong and more pragmatic bureaucratic plan advocates like deng xiaoping and zhou enlai and despite political and economic calamities caused by the great leap forward 1959 60 and the launching of the cultural revolution 1966 69 the three decades between the ascension to power of the ccp and the beginning of reform and opening saw considerably higher rates of economic growth more rapid rates of basic industrialization and far better improvements in life expectancy and literacy than in india china s fellow asian mega country which began independence at a similar level of poverty and which passed through the same years under a bureaucratically supervised capitalist and politically democratic system what proved most intolerable to would be modernizers like deng was not the complete absence of progress under the planned economy but the glaringly poor comparison with taiwan south korea and hong kong s paces of catching up with the industrialized west that and the sense that china had been holding itself back through ideological rigidity and that it could almost double its growth pace if it seized the opportunities that relative poverty a largely healthy and disciplined workforce a long coastline and abundance of ports and geographic and cultural proximity to the fastest growing economies in the world afforded it did the u s and the other western countries aid and abet china s economic rise after 1979 absolutely i clearly recall sitting in numerous seminars at the u s universities i attended in the late 1970s and being told again and again that china would never be able to follow in the footsteps of taiwan and s korea were it to try such a thing because their rapid growth had relied heavily on exporting to relatively open western markets such markets many economists felt could absorb the manufactures of some small strategically allied countries but would never be left so open to the greater flow of manufactures from an export oriented continent sized country with many times the populations of taiwan and s korea and yet when china proceeded to follow those japan inspired growth models by establishing special economic zones along its southeastern coast and inviting private investment investment that proceeded to flow especially rapidly from an overseas chinese diaspora possessed of approximately the same volume of capital in private hands as the nation of china had accumulated in public hands during its three decades of central planning the u s and other western markets proved remarkably open far from boycotting chinese goods in order to contain china the primary response was to celebrate the fact that china seemed to be abandoning communism and to welcome its entrance into world markets while gradually tutoring it in that market s rules major second thoughts followed the brutal 1989 crackdown beijing university students had taken advantage of the relatively liberal atmosphere permitted by the recently purged and then deceased hu yaobang and by his successor and reformist partner zhao ziyang they had begun staging protests on a larger scale than had been witnessed since the early months of the maoist cultural revolution and the government was showing surprising forbearance events then took a surreal turn top u s and european television news anchormen and camera crews descended on beijing in mid may 1989 to cover the historic visit of mikhail gorbachev itself marking an effort to turn the page on a sino soviet dispute that had been roiling world political waters since 1960 including the spawning of several proxy wars between opposing militias in africa the demonstrators realized that the government couldn t stage a crack down in china s central political square in front of so many cameras and the number of demonstrators ballooned with similar demonstrations beginning in many other cities once gorbachev and some of the cameras were gone china tried using local troops to clear the square but beijing residents stood up for the demonstrators and the local army units accepted flowers from them and refused to crack down with many protestors believing they had outmaneuvered the government deng xiaoping and hardliners dismissed the too tolerant zhao brought in loyal army units from more remote regions in the dead of the night of june 3 and turned the area around tiananmen square into a battle scene with uncounted numbers of dead the burst of unrestrained killing followed by months of political education and propaganda convinced the public that political reform was off the table and that their survival required silence the west greeted as heroes those protest leaders who managed to be smuggled out china safely and many voices were raised to call for strong sanctions against china s government foreign investment briefly declined and the harder line communist elements who replaced zhao even flirted with scuttling some 1980s era reforms but within three years deng succeeded in drumming up a new burst of reform and foreign investment started to rise on an unprecedented scale soon a new generation of chinese leaders committed to both rapid economic growth using a blend of the e asian export promotion model massive state investment in supporting industries and infrastructure and bottom up entrepreneurial spirit in city and countryside were planning to meet the requirements for wto entry which would further ramp up chinese export growth and guarantee growth of the market side of the hybrid economy even they probably didn t realize how little of the state control side of this hybrid they would really be required to concede to achieve the bargain by the 2010s the chinese government was sitting atop mountains of foreign currency buying companies and geostrategic access around the world and investing massively to bring its scientific and technological capabilities up to the international frontier and in some areas even to begin surpassing a u s whose anti state ideology was starving its scientific labs of proper funding was it a mistake for the west to permit china s economic rise without demanding more political reforms we clearly have to answer in the affirmative if we re thinking of the tens of thousands of han chinese dissidents still in prisons and re education camps or under house arrest or of the millions of uyghurs tibetans and other minorities being imprisoned and seeing their ancestral lands be systematically sinicized by growing ethnic han populations or of the millions of chinese men who will be unable to find wives due to the gender imbalance created by the excesses of china s one child policy or of the tens of millions of missing or unborn chinese women or of the hundreds of thousands who will be victims of petty violence caused by the attendant social stresses etc etc we have to answer in the affirmative if we think that china s transition from scandinavian like low levels of inequality to guatemala like heights of economic inequality is not entirely a good thing we have to answer in the affirmative if we think of the hundreds of millions of chinese who grew up in ignorance of their government s blatant trampling on basic human rights and values and of the tens of thousands who continue to leave china year after year to seek out better lives in freer countries robbing their nation of its best and brightest but the question on the strictly economic side of the ledger is more complicated in brief china s economy achieved the longest period of the highest sustained economic growth for any large nation in the world s economic history thanks in part to its openness to the entrepreneurial energies of investors from taiwan hong kong s korea and other countries and to the openness of markets like that of the u s to the products this juggernaut has been pumping out decade after decade domestic entrepreneurship and energy including the impressive efforts of local leaders in tens of thousands of china s rural towns and small cities also contributed its part the average incomes of china s people have more than quintupled since economic reforms began a feat unrivaled in human history though income gains within china have been extremely unequal almost everyone has gained a little and at least half a billion people have gone from global poverty standards of 2 or 3 a day worth of consumption to joining the world s middle and upper middle classes not to mention the tens of thousands who have joined the world s rich the costs of the vast majority of consumer goods in the united states from shoes clothing and sporting equipment to smartphones tv sets and computers have risen less rapidly than would otherwise have been expected thanks to the relatively low wages and efficiency of chinese production contributing considerably to americans abilities to maintain their lifestyles despite stagnant incomes for the lower 90 numerous countries in africa central asia and other regions have seen improvements in rates of economic growth thanks to china s immense demand for petroleum minerals and selected agricultural products even as china has assiduously maintained food self sufficiency in staples like rice wheat and pork it cannot be counted as bad that the ranks of the world s economic middle class people who can comfortably enjoy the advantages of modern indoor plumbing heating and air conditioning transport and communication and some discretionary spending on the occasional movie and meal out has grown from the small fraction of the world s people living in western europe and its offshoots in the u s canada and the like to at least double its 1979 numbers thanks to china s economic rise but in 2019 it s clear that there s been a high price to pay the globalization which raced ahead as china and the u s became ever more entangled in an unsustainable economic embrace with china s trade surpluses ballooning and the u s s foreign debts correspondingly growing in large parts thanks to cheap financing of our public debt by china coincided with an era in which u s economic policy was itself lurching further and further away from its mid 20th century equilibrium between business and labor this form of globalization worked splendidly for america s elites including corporations like walmart and apple who were able to profit handsomely from the stream of low cost chinese products and elite universities brimming with the full tuition paying children of china s nouveau riche both mainstream democrats and pre trump republicans were happy enough with the status quo everyone was fine with the fact that china s government s pumping of money into domestic projects to allow its economy to continue growing through the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 prevented the world economy as a whole from experiencing a deeper and more prolonged recession everything has changed since donald trump recognized the potential to harness blue color grievances against china s economic successes and a raft of other issues to turn u s politics on its head the disagreements on trade and other matters between the u s and china have genuine substance but they re being milked by our current administration only for short run political gain and with little chance of actually harnessing the benefits of global trade and economic growth for the benefit of anyone beyond the wealthy beneficiaries of current policies the old jobs aren t coming back forming a new world economic order that benefits the large majority of people in both america and china and ideally in a still broader range of countries is to be aspired to but neither june 4 2019 nor july 4 2019 are likely to see much immediate relief from the current trends on both sides of the pacific

l randall wray in recent days the international policy making elite has tried to distance itself from mmt often going to hysterical extremes to dismiss the approach as crazy no one does this better than the japanese as mmt began to gather momentum its developers began to receive a flood of calls from reporters around the world enquiring whether japan serves as the premier example of a country that follows mmt policy recommendations my answer is always the same no japan is the perfect case to demonstrate that all of mainstream theory and policy is wrong and that it is the best example of a country that always chooses the anti mmt policy response to every ill that ails the country reporters find that shocking biggest government fiscal deficits in the developed country world check highest government debt ratios in the developed country world check isn t that what mmt advises no nay it is the perfect demonstration that all the mainstream bogeymen are false big deficits cause inflation no japan s inflation runs just above zero see graph big debts cause high interest rates no japan s policy rate is about 0 10 negative rates big debts cause bond vigilante strikes no japan s government debt is hoovered up as fast as it can be issued all the more true with the boj running qe and creating a scarcity in spite of the quadrillions of yen debt available critics of mmt counter that japan is proof that big deficits kill investment and growth well it is true that japan has been growing at just 1 per year certainly nothing to write home about however investment grows at about a 2 pace but is pulled down by lack of consumption growth which has averaged just about zero over the past few years yet unemployment clocks in at only 3 in spite of slow growth as the labor force shrinks due to an aging population per capita gdp has been stuck at about 38 000 for years not so bad but not growing and japan s current account surplus has surged from under 1 to 4 of gdp over the past few years considered to be good by most commentators unfortunately trump s trade war seems to have already hurt japan s exports and the prognosis for growth this year is rather dismal the april survey of consumer confidence showed it collapsing to the lowest level in three years from the mmt perspective what japan needs is a good fiscal stimulus albeit one that is targeted japan has three injections into the economy the fiscal deficit which has fallen from 7 of gdp to about 5 over the past few years still a substantial injection the current account surplus and private investment but what it needs is stronger growth of domestic consumer demand which would also stimulate investment directed to home consumption so fiscal policy ought to be targeted to spending that would increase economic security of japanese households to the point that they d increase consumer spending so what is prime minister abe s announced plan to raise the sales tax to squelch consumption and reduce economic growth you cannot make this up this has been japan s policy for a whole generation any time it looks like the economy might break out of its long term stagnation policy makers impose austerity in an attempt to reduce the fiscal deficit and thereby throw the economy back into its permanent recession clearly this is the precise opposite to the mmt recommendation and yet pundits proclaim japan has been following mmt policy all these years why because japan has run big fiscal deficits as if mmt s policy goal is big government deficits and debt ratios no we see the budget as a tool to pursue the public interest things like full employment inclusive and sustainable growth to be sure by many reasonable measures japan does ok in spite of policy mistakes certainly in comparison to the usa japan looks pretty good good and accessible healthcare low infant mortality long lifespans low measured unemployment and much less inequality and poverty but japan could do better if it actually did adopt the mmt view that the budgetary outcome by itself is not an important issue but no the japanese officials are falling all over themselves to make it clear that they will never adopt mmt finance minister taro aso called mmt an extreme idea and dangerous as it would weaken fiscal discipline one wonders how a reporter could listen to that without bursting out in laughter japan s fiscal discipline would be threatened by mmt the debt ratio is already approaching 250 by conventional measures japan has the worst fiscal discipline the world has ever seen but wait it gets even funnier boj policy board member yutaka harada kept up the attack on mmt the approach proposed by mmt will cause inflation for sure the boj has done everything it could think of for the past quarter century to get the inflation rate up to 2 quadrillions of qe negative interest rates and the boj thinks mmt could produce runaway inflation i doubt that even weimar s reichsbank could cause high inflation in japan ok that s a cheap shot at japan s policymakers what they do not understand is that there are two ways to produce a high deficit and debt ratio the ugly way and the good way mmt has been arguing this for a long time but with little progress in promoting understanding i think that the main reason is because we ve been using plain english economists are not good at reading for comprehension they need pictures and math perhaps the following will help yes i gave it a name there s the laffer curve the phillips curve and now the wray curve i didn t draw it on a cocktail napkin at a bar but rather jotted it down on a note pad before bed last night assume the economy is at point a for japan this would represent a 5 deficit ratio and a 1 rate of growth now pm abe imposes a consumption tax or the usa plummets into a downturn reducing japan s growth rate the economy moves up and to the left toward point b as growth slows and the deficit ratio rises slower growth reduces tax revenue even as it scares households and firms which reduce spending in an effort to build up savings the slower growth also reduces imports so the current account improves somewhat from the sectoral balance perspective the government s balance moves further into deficit to say a 7 fiscal deficit the current account surplus rises say from 4 to 5 and the private sector s surplus grows to 12 the sum of the other two balances that s the ugly way to increase a fiscal deficit it is the japanese way it is like a perpetual bleeding of the patient in the hope that further blood loss will cure her ills what is the mmt alternative measured and targeted stimulus designed to restore confidence of firms and households ramp up the social security safety net to assure the japanese people that they will be taken care of in their old age recreate a commitment to secure jobs and decent pay either promote births or encourage immigration to replace the declining workforce undertake a green new deal to transition to a carbon free future in that case we move along the curve from point a toward point c the fiscal deficit increases in the good way while growth improves note however that the boost to the deficit will only be temporary households and firms will begin to spend and their surplus will fall the current account surplus will fall too as imports rise tax revenues will increase not because rates rise but because income increases the fiscal deficit will fall as the domestic private surpluses decline precisely how much the deficit will fall depends on the movement of the private surplus and current account surplus with the deficit falling to equality with the sum in terms of the graph above the wray curve shifts out to the right point a will be consistent with a higher rate of growth for a given deficit ratio there s nothing natural about the deficit ratio at point a as it depends on the other two sectoral balances for the usa point a is consistent with a higher growth rate but probably a similar deficit ratio to that of japan our current account balance is of course negative which implies a higher fiscal deficit however our private sector s surplus is smaller than japan s for any given growth rate which implies a lower fiscal deficit the two essentially offset one another to leave the us deficit ratio at about 5 but with higher growth than japan note that we are not proposing a sort of reverse laffer curve recall that the laffer curve says that tax cuts more than pay for themselves trickle down growth boosts revenue sufficiently to close a fiscal deficit i am not arguing that the stimulative increase of government spending will increase tax revenue so much that the deficit ratio returns to its original level or less where it actually ends up depends on movements of the two other sectoral balances not that the size of the deficit by itself is important what is important is whether government budget policy helps in the pursuit of the public and private interests the deficit will always adjust to be just the right size to balance the other two sectoral balances but that equality can be consistent with any growth rate including a rate that is too low deflationary or too high inflationary and the sectoral balance equality holds with any fiscal deficit ratio so while it is likely that a successful stimulus will shift the wray curve out to the right we cannot predict exactly where the new fiscal deficit ratio will settle as the growth rate rises what is most important about this graph is the recognition that there are at least two different growth rates consistent with a given deficit ratio we can achieve a particular growth rate either in the ugly way or in the good way while generating the same deficit ratio japan continually operates its economy to produce ugly deficits precisely because it fears fiscal expansion for further discussion of fiscal deficits along these lines see the new textbook by mitchell wray and watts macroeconomics macmillan international red globe press chapter 8 and especially pp 124 128 note i am presuming that japan is unhappy with zero growth and that the country faces many unmet domestic needs i am not an advocate of growth for growth s sake especially in light of the growing recognition that humanity may well have only a decade or so left on planet earth unless we very quickly change our ways however changing our ways will require major investments in a japanese green new deal so even with zero growth there is a role for ramped up fiscal policy
examining the jse s top companies can illuminate the problems of the economy and the business environment as well as giving us a clue about what might happen to jse stocks in future advertisement don t want to see this remove ads we should be concerned about the state of the jse because most of us are invested in the stock market through retirement funds exchange traded funds or unit trusts government pensioners through the public investment corporation are invested in the jse though their pensions are guaranteed by the state whatever happens to the government employees pension fund so taxpayers are ultimately on the hook around r1 trillion of the r1 8 trillion pic investment portfolio is invested in the jse according to the 2018 pic annual report and the companies listed on the jse particularly those with domestic operations are the biggest employers and potential taxpayers so what happens to them should also concern us not all companies on the jse have major domestic operations however richemont for instance created out of the anton rupert empire in the 1980s to keep the family fortunes safe overseas sells european luxury goods like cartier jewellery iwc schaffhausen wristwatches and mont blanc pens and only derives around 7 of its sales in the middle east and africa so there s the catch for those who complain that the south african economy and by extension the south african government are solely to blame for the market s inferior performance the top companies on our stock exchange as gavin keeton of rhodes university s economics department points out such as the world s largest publicly traded tobacco company british american tobacco plc bat and the world s largest brewer anheuser busch inbev sa nv have their headquarters and extensive operations outside the country bat for instance reports that only around 18 of its revenue and a like amount of operational profit came from the americas and sub saharan africa region and ab inbev has reported

with offshore hqs and operations account for a big share of the jse market cap only about a quarter of the shares of the foreign domiciled companies like bat are actually available to south african investors according to a 2017 ownership monitor report commissioned by the treasury this means that the stratospheric market capitalisation of the jse is an illusion in that report 55 of the jse s market cap was available in 2017 to south african investors that would mean a market cap for the jse now of r8 5 trillion as opposed to r15 5 trillion the domestic resources companies rely on export earnings and what they export is determined in global markets over which south africa has no say gold platinum coal and iron ore prices are priced on world exchanges in dollars not only do global

scenarios when global liquid capital is in more of a gambling mood than not and prepared to invest in emerging markets and risk off situations where capital prefers safe though not particularly profitable havens such as low interest us bonds uncertainty about global economic growth because of a developing trade war between the us and china might for instance prompt foreign investors to sell shares on the jse and keep the money in cash or bonds a slump in commodities might mean investors take a dim view of our mining companies prospects and move into us manufacturing firms for example south africa needs foreign investment because our cheque account with the rest of the world the current account of the balance of payments is in deficit that deficit was around 3 5 of gross domestic

speculation shares of companies that are priced in us dollars or swiss francs should rise when the rand falls but as richemont s share performance over five years shows rand hedges haven t invariably been surefire investments while the big foreign based firms and the exporters depend on the global economy a stagnant local economy has made life hard for south african based companies the difference in the mean average of real gdp growth rates in the world and the south african gdp growth rate average was 0 6 percentage points from 2000 to 2013 it widened to 2 44 between 2014 and 2018 in short south africa s economic growth which has been tracking the world growth rate quite closely since 1994 has shown a widening gap since 2014 stock markets and economic growth do not rise and fall in tandem and stock market performance can be decoupled from growth but low disposable income and weak consumer confidence et al do affect domestic investor share buying source international monetary fund so the consequence of mediocre economic growth a reduced global appetite for emerging markets the collapse in commodity prices and global economic adversity has taken its toll on the country and companies on the jse looking at the top companies on the jse one could conclude not much has changed from when the south african economy consisted of digging stuff out of the ground selling it overseas and sending the money abroad to buy stuff made overseas except that we have more people than ever selling financial and other services as well the only big purely industrial company listed on

areas of what has been described as our cartel economy were exposed to new competition steinhoff was one of the companies that fell out of the top 40 when its share price plunged the value destruction steinhoff represents would have been difficult to believe five years ago the company s problems can be laid at the door of outright criminality but hard questions have to be asked about governance and the ability of the market and media to see red flags at other companies too which have plummeted out of the top 40 never waste a good crisis the saying goes and now is the time to take a hard look at

a bank clerk counts u s dollars in nanjing capital of east chinaâ s jiangsu province on august 12 2015 xinhua china has reduced the u s government bonds it holds thereby becoming the second largest holder of u s treasuries behind japan at the end of october 2016 china s u s government investments had fallen 41 3 billion to 1 12 trillion while japan s portfolio had decreased by 4 5 billion to 1 13 trillion according to a report by ftchinese com china s massive foreign exchange reservesâ over 3 trillionâ is indicative of achievements in trade over the past decades in becoming the world s largest goods trader china has accumulated vast foreign exchange reserves which ensure its trade security it is not however a case of the bigger the better if things go wrong the huge foreign exchange pool could trigger a trade war and become an impediment for china for years the yuan u s dollar exchange rate and china s huge trade surplus with the united states have caused much contention and many trade disputes between the two sides before the yuan became an international reserve currency china s foreign exchange reserves had to be settled in u s dollars in the dollar dominated world the best way to invest in this fortune was to buy u s treasury bonds even though china s holdings of u s debt depreciated as the dollar lost value during the financial crisis back then u s treasuries remained the safest means of maintaining the value of assets things however changed over the past years with several rounds of quantitative easing in the united states and urgent demand by europe for china s foreign exchange reserves china began diversifying its foreign holdings into different currencies gradually reducing its u s exposure and buying more euro denominated assets now included in the international monetary fund s special drawing rights sdr basket the yuan is becoming an international reserve currency and its exchange rate has been pegged to the values of multiple currencies instead of just to that of the u s dollar this is another reason for china to reduce its u s government bond holdings a more important reason is maintaining yuan exchange rate stability a more stable and market oriented formation of renminbi exchange rates is needed to ensure exchange rate reform and safeguard the yuan s sdr inclusion and the renminbi s overvaluation for more than two decades must also be reversed such depreciation in value is normal abnormal market fluctuations have also played a role in recent yuan depreciation for instance the first interest rate hike by the u s federal reserve in 2015 stimulated yuan depreciation and the interest rate gap between onshore and offshore renminbi markets led to short selling of renminbi by international speculators to avoid the chilling effect on the renminbi exchange rate under such circumstances china s central bank needed to purchase the renminbi with its foreign exchange reserves in order to maintain the yuan s stability as donald trump has been elected u s president and the u s federal reserve has raised interest rates again china faces the double pressure of declining renminbi exchange rates and capital outflow the yuan has been depreciating against the dollar since october 2016 therefore given china s hefty foreign exchange reserves the central bank has continued to use standard means to keep the yuan stable after 2014 most of china s foreign exchange reserves were used to buy u s treasuries now though such investment has been reduced partly because china s central bank is selling u s dollars to maintain renminbi stability in the future china will increase or narrow its holdings of u s treasuries according to changing market circumstances the state of the u s economic recovery and the status of the u s dollar mean that china must hold a certain amount of u s treasuries while the yuan s position as an international reserve currency becomes more stable china s holdings of u s treasuries will fluctuate to address market risks brought by the internationalization process china s planned reduction in its u s government investments and its reduction of foreign exchange reserves are active measures to make its foreign trade more balanced this is conducive to lowering china s trade surplus improving its relations with major trading partners and reducing the likelihood of currency and trade wars with major trading economies it is also a signal sent by china as a responsible trading power in the post crisis era the author is a visiting researcher at chongyang institute for financial studies at renmin university of china and this article is published in national business daily copyedited by chris surtees

while no one can predict what new headlines are in store for us today we can expect volatility reflecting investors frayed nerves in the earlier asian session regional equities popped higher on hopes the fed to offset the negative impact of ongoing trade wars however most indices gave up some gains after the world bank downgraded its forecast for the world economy citing the escalating trade

regional benchmark closing in the red 0 03 if china s own stimulus failed to support the index from slipping almost a full percentage point yesterday it appears that a potential fed cut also failed to excite chinese traders mexico s confidence in resolving its dispute with the u s does not help china either if anything the less distracted trump is with other countries the more focused he can be on china global financial affairs in tuesday s u s session shares on all four major indices jumped at least 2 the most since jan 4 powell acknowledged the uncertainty of trade negotiations their possible adverse impact on the u s economy and the fed s commitment to its 2 inflation target we are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u s economic outlook and as always we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion said powell fedspeak for putting a rate cut squarely on the table the argument for a potential rate cut was reinforced with vice chair who repeated the message that the fed would put in place policies that not only achieve but sustain price stability and maximum employment and we ll do that if we need to the move would align u s policymakers with global central banks which have been based on economic data clarida made a rare reference to financial markets saying the central bank can t be handcuffed to them and suggesting it was too early to take a signal of concern from the inverted treasury yield curve though he would take it seriously if the situation persisted in other words while the fed s monetary policy isn t dictated by investors the central bank might follow their lead if they are stubborn enough which is why the financial market is a leading indicator of the economy meanwhile yields have erased gains that had been favored by

excerpts from recent editorials in the united states and abroad ___ june 5 china daily on the united states approach to chinese telecommunications equipment company huawei us secretary of state mike pompeo may think he has been doing a good job in throttling the growth of chinese telecommunications equipment company huawei because wherever he goes he has tried to sell the notion that the company poses a severe threat to national security and intelligence and dissuade the countries concerned from doing any business with it but he might have been overdoing it a little bit even to the extent that the well intentioned advice as he claims it is has sounded more like coercion that even his hosts find it hard to accept during his visit to the netherlands early this week pompeo told his hosts not to do anything that would endanger our shared security interests by embracing huawei prompting his dutch counterpart to retort that every country must make its own security decisions the us top diplomat had already harped on the same string in germany last week urging chancellor angela merkel s government to take actions against chinese espionage and warning the us might have to change its behaviour regarding intelligence sharing if berlin failed to do so the fact that pompeo has often received a cold shoulder when trying to smear huawei in this way shows his audiences know when they are being fed a line he seems to have forgotten that country to country relations are built on common interests not one dictating to another what the other can and cannot do that s why the united kingdom has so far resisted washington s call to shun huawei in its new 5g network despite the tremendous pressure it faces from the us because it knows firsthand that the chinese company does not threaten its national security as it has already been closely involved in its 4g network if he truly believes that huawei is bent on helping the chinese government spy on other governments even after it has proposed to sign no spy deals with possible partners and even after countries have put themselves on high alert in response to the us sounding constant alarm bells pompeo should at least consider changing tactic rather than keep on babbling about an imagined danger he should have confidence in the counterintelligence capabilities of the world s sole superpower and let other governments give huawei s equipment and system a try if huawei is spying the us should be able to catch it red handed that outcome if it materialized would save pompeo all the trouble of travelling around the world trying to convince a largely incredulous audience after all facts speak louder than words online ___ june 4 the virginian pilot on the victims of a mass shooting in virginia beach keith cox served the residents of virginia beach in the public utilities department for 12 years well liked by co workers he spent his final moments on friday working to protect them from a gunman in the municipal centre sacrificing his life in the process the remembrance of cox published in the pilot on monday is one of many heartbreaking stories to emerge from the darkness that still hangs over this community four days after the worst mass shooting in the city s history attention should be paid to the criminal investigation being conducted by local state and federal law enforcement agencies they are diving into the details of the shooter s life his movements prior to the attack and the possible motivation for this horrific act in the hope of gaining some insight into why and how this happened but for now our focus should be on those precious lives cut short on friday celebrating their memory and paying tribute to their selflessness they deserve no less from the community they served so let us remember cox the public utilities account clerk who was described as a jovial caring co worker and a talented singer in the choir at new hope baptist church where his father serves as pastor as the shooter roamed the building cox ushered several employees into an office telling them to lock the door while he looked for others to help rich nettleton spent 28 years working for the city as a utilities engineer a norfolk resident and old dominion university graduate he was a lieutenant for the army s 130th engineer brigade in germany where he served with beach city manager dave hansen joshua hardy spent more than four years as an engineering technician but loved ones remembered him as a devout christian whose love for children led him to author the abc book on protecting yourself from strangers a book he self published in 2011 missy langer worked as an administrative assistant in the public utilities department for 12 years neighbors recalled her as a passionate pittsburgh steelers fan she had a tough few years long both her parents in the last five years but was proud of the life she built in virginia beach kate nixon was an engineer with a decade of experience working for the city whose love of her husband and three children was plainly evident to all who knew her alex gusev came to this country from belarus in 2003 and was recalled by a colleague as a model professional who handled right of way issues for virginia beach he was also a graduate of odu who was quick to help friends and loved ones in need for most of her 24 years in virginia beach government mary lou gayle worked as a right of way agent who was recalled by neighbours for the upkeep and improvements made to her home which was described as gorgeous a parishioner at st john the apostle catholic church gayle was well thought of by all those in her orbit tara gallagher a graduate of portsmouth s woodrow wilson high school earned two engineering degrees from odu before joining the city six years ago laquita brown a chesapeake resident was a right of way agent for more than four years bert snelling was a contractor visiting building 2 for a permit when the shooting began another odu graduate chris rapp joined the city 11 months ago after serving as stafford county s public works director for two years he was recalled for his love of bagpipes which he played with tidewater pipes drums and his devotion to family and friends and bobby williams who joined the city in 1981 was repeatedly honoured for his lengthy public service throughout his career he was the type of employee who provides invaluable continuity and institutional memory to municipal government stories about each of the victims are available to read they have been told with respect grace and sensitivity honouring the memory of each life lost and the emotional toll on those left behind hold them all in your hearts online ___ june 4 the wall street journal on u s economic policies as the election results became clear in 2016 financial markets rose amid a surge of economic optimism that surge continued for two years as donald trump and republicans pursued a pro growth agenda of tax reform deregulation and encouraging domestic energy production but with democrats now controlling the house and mr trump already campaigning for re election washington is again taking an anti growth turn don t be surprised if slower growth follows that s the disappointing big picture if you step back from the daily fray and look at the direction of u s economic policy mr trump s first two years were focused relentlessly on ending the economic malaise of the obama years nearly every policy was seen through a growth prism but as he focuses on re election mr trump is returning to the issues that marked the worst moments of his 2016 campaign he is restrictionist on immigration increasingly protectionist on trade and more interventionist in regulating business he favours price controls on drugs a mandate for paid family leave and his regulators are revving up what looks like it could become the largest federal antitrust campaign since the 1970s meanwhile house and senate democrats are advancing their own election agenda that includes higher taxes and new regulation on finance and industry the only pro growth measure that could pass would be mr trump s renegotiated nafta deal but that is in greater jeopardy after last week s tariffs on mexico gridlock will probably prevail through 2020 but investors will have to start discounting the chance that democrats could implement much of their agenda in 2021 all of this is already hurting growth and especially business investment the institute for supply management s manufacturing index fell to 52 1 in may its lowest since 2016 surveys of cfos show that investment plans for 2019 have slowed sharply amid the new policy uncertainty a majority of business earnings calls mention trade as a major concern the residual good news is that the policy reforms of 2017 built considerable pro growth momentum that led to 3 1 growth in 2018 the labour market is still buoyant and wages are rising yet these are often lagging indicators and consumer confidence typically declines if markets and growth fall falling bond yields are signalling a growth slowdown and the yield curve is inverted in what nearly always predicts a recession if it continues for three months the atlanta federal reserve s gdp now estimate for second quarter growth is down to 1 3 and even some long time bulls are warning that we may be looking at a return to the slow growth of the obama years mr trump seems to believe the federal reserve can make everything great again by cutting interest rates and he may get the rate cuts he wants this year we opposed the fed s rate increase in december and that advice looks vindicated by declining inflation but the fed can t offset bad trade policy by itself u s tariffs have a negative impact on growth around the world which in turn hurts u s exports that s part of the explanation for the recent decline in u s manufacturing as slower growth abroad means declining demand for american goods we aren t predicting recession though you can t rule that out if mr trump follows through on his worst trade threats against china mexico and europe asterisk asterisk asterisk a conceit of nearly all politicians is that they can get away with bad economic policies without paying too high a price barack obama believed that his regulatory assaults on business had more benefits than costs his economic advisers told him that higher tax rates don t matter they should have learned otherwise after eight years of 2 growth and slow wage gains that laid the path for mr trump in 2016 now mr trump and his republican fellow travellers think they can impose tariffs willy nilly with little damage they say the doomsayers were wrong about the impact of the initial round of china tariffs and in any case the tariffs are popular with the public they say mr trump needs wedge issues against democrats in 2020 and he can run as a trade hawk on china against joe biden but mr trump campaigned in 2016 on reviving the economy and the surge of growth has helped to offset his personal unpopularity bad policies operate at the margin and their effect is cumulative the initial tariffs were dwarfed by the growth effects of tax reform and deregulation but the damage from tariffs will rise if they increase in severity and are imposed impulsively sooner or later bad policies always exact a high economic and political cost online ___ june 4 the plain dealer of cleveland ohio on the anniversary of d day on june 7 1944 readers of the plain dealer got a firsthand account of the allies pivotal d day landing the day before from the paper s war correspondent roelif loveland writing from a balcony seat high up in god s heaven as flak and tracer bullets lit up the sky around his aircraft and the cleveland family of 1st lt howard c quiggle was also able to read that he was alive and well and piloting the b 26 marauder that had ferried loveland to his eagle s perch above the battle riding the tail of a comet to see history in the making as loveland wrote in his page one story after that fateful day the d day landings that changed the course of war and accelerated adolf hitler s slow descent to defeat were launched 75 years ago this week we will accept nothing less than full victory came the order from supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force u s gen dwight d eisenhower yet victory was never certain a handwritten note from ike written in case of defeat concludes the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone fortunately bravery and devotion as well as luck planning daring and deep sacrifice by those who launched and fought on those bloody beaches did the trick attacking along 50 miles of shoreline more than 4 000 allied troops fell on that first day but many more followed beginning the drive for berlin where are they now those intrepid paratroopers bombardiers pilots medics army rangers and all those others who stormed ashore on june 6 1944 like 1st lt quiggle and roelif loveland a world war i combat veteran considered one of the greatest writers ever to grace the pages of the plain dealer most have passed on to their rewards only about 30 american survivors are expected to attend this year s d day battle anniversary in france nearly 350 world war ii veterans die every day the u s veterans affairs department estimates according to the associated press pretty soon they all will be gone and the rest of us must be the ones to carry forward their stories and remember the history they forged and their sacrifice and that of their fallen comrades longtime plain dealer military affairs reporter brian albrecht has helped by spending years compiling vivid stories from d day survivors and others who fought in or contributed to the war effort during world war ii twelve of those stories were highlighted in sunday s plain dealer from the 2008 remembrances of the late english clerk betty leighty of parma heights who came to the united states as a war bride in 1946 to john bistrica s vivid 1994 depiction of the tumultuous bloody landing at omaha beach and the night he spent freezing wet and hungry in a 20 foot hole he had to dig himself bistrica at 95 was recently profiled in the vindicator of youngstown where he lives their powerful stories need to be remembered along with the d day fight so crucial to ultimate victory in that war but are our collective memories fading too fast an associated press story in the plain dealer tuesday reported that many states no longer require d day to be part of the history curriculum the ohio department of education s 52 page model american history curriculum posted at education ohio gov does not mention d day that doesn t mean that teachers can t teach it and many probably do and educators might argue that as we get farther away in time from a conflict teaching its root causes and long term impacts becomes more important than the specifics of any given battle but specifics of battle also matter the nitty gritty reality of war matters so on this 75th anniversary of the d day battle we collectively should resolve to work harder to make sure this history this sacrifice this longest day isn t lost when the last veteran of that battle departs his earthly existence online ___ june 4 the los angeles times on the tiananmen square protests thirty years ago tuesday the world watched in horror as chinese troops cracked down brutally on peaceful protests by students who sought to give the chinese people more say over their daily lives the lingering image of the pro democracy movement though was from the next day when a lone unarmed man stopped a column of tanks in tiananmen square it was a symbol of courage defiance and the power of an individual sustained perhaps by the fact that he s never been identified and his fate is unknown to many in the west the crackdown was but a death rattle of an authoritarian system on the wrong side of history as the growing liberalized chinese economy spread prosperity across the country and as the internet opened a window into free world thought and culture they believed the pressure for democracy and self determination would become irresistible in the three decades since then the chinese economy has in fact grown spectacularly lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty and creating a strong middle class but the technology that helped chinese people to connect to one another in unprecedented ways also enabled orwellian surveillance and propaganda operations that have helped cement the chinese communist party s autocratic grip on power the chinese government has also used concerns about terrorism as a pretext to enact cynical security laws that give it even more power to spy on online traffic suppress dissent and block foreign nonprofits from assisting its critics meanwhile by allowing some public pushback on the digital margins tolerating small scale online agitation for consumer protection or improvements in public works the government pantomimes the accountability found in a democracy true change remains a mirage as a result china s pro democracy movement seems to be sustained mainly by activists who ve fled to safer shores it s telling that while we in the west can still see the tank man photos watch the video and read about the incident the chinese government is trying to erase them from its people s memory but then tanks are so 20th century today the fist of chinese oppression is best symbolized by the reeducation camps in xinjiang province roughly 2 000 miles west of tiananmen square where the chinese government has detained up to 2 million muslims in an effort to combat alleged separatism and religious extremism among the native uighurs not coincidentally the province is a key outpost in china s belt and road initiative that aims to increase china s exports to and its influence over south asia africa and europe we certainly hope that china s growing prosperity and integration into global commerce will prove inimical to its authoritarian impulses but the years since the tiananmen square protests have shown us that progress toward liberty and democracy is not inevitable in china the government sells stability as the guarantor of the economic growth that the public craves when its real aim is to keep the forces of change at bay online ___ june 4 the houston chronicle on storm recovery funds can you hear us now the trump administration s outrageous delays in making available more than 12 billion in storm recovery funds about 4 3 billion of the total is for texas have finally been dealt with the house on monday approved a senate bill that sets a 90 day countdown for the administration to formally invite states such as texas to submit spending plans for the money that will kick start the release of the funds that means flood recovery funds approved by congress just months after hurricane harvey hit in 2017 will get to texas in 2020 that s astoundingly tardy and yet even getting that much grease in the gears took quite literally an act of congress when texas land commissioner george p bush began raising hell with the administration over the delays early this year folks at housing and urban development which administers the funds and the office of management of budget which approves all new rules seemed anything but fazed at that time aides to both sen ted cruz and sen john cornyn told the editorial board that they had also been hammering at the administration to add a sense of urgency none of that got far instead what worked was individual members of congress decided to cross party lines and introduce legislation that would force the administration s hand cornyn teamed with sen joe manchin the west virginia democrat on a bill to require the disbursement of the funds a similar bill was authored in the house by a gaggle of members of congress including rep lizzie fletcher d houston neither bill passed but cornyn and others managed to include its basic provisions in a larger disaster funding bill that did now all that s required is president donald trump s signature which he s expected to give congratulations to cornyn manchin and the house members who made it so perhaps there s a lesson about dealing with the president talk is cheap but legislation can produce results as we await the presidential signature we note that many questions have been left unanswered why was the administration so slow hud officials told the editorial board earlier this year that because the funds were being spent in new ways on preventing future flood damage rather than repairing damage from previous floods new rules were needed congress was right to change the focus of these funds but hud should never have allowed the simple change to slow things down so profoundly others worried that the real reason for the delays flowed from the president s bitter reaction to puerto rico and the recovery it so badly needs in the wake of hurricane maria absent proof we ll pray that the latter feud played no role in the delays and either way the intricacies of team trump s machinations can be the subject for a debate another day the welcome news this week is that congress intervened in a way that should pay dividends for texas and fairly soon online ___ june 1 the new york times on recent deaths on mount everest because it s there for those who grew up on george mallory s famous explanation for his yearning to scale mount everest with all the romance danger and spirit of exploration it implied that viral photograph of an endless line of climbers in puffy parkas inching their way to the summit came as a profound shock danger there is at least 11 people died on the mountain this year as did mr mallory in 1924 the year after that interview with the times leaving forever open the question of whether he had first reached the summit all but two of those who died this climbing season perished on the way down overcome by altitude sickness and exhaustion after the hourslong delays created by the traffic jam in the oxygen starved atmosphere above 28 000 feet the other two fell as the snow and ice on the mountain succumb to climate change it is becoming common for climbers to come across the remains of those who died over the years but romance for mr mallory the need to reach the highest point on the planet was instinctive a part i suppose of man s desire to conquer the universe the conquest however has turned out to entail a landscape littered with tons of plastic bottles food tins excrement ropes and tents and scores of oxygen starved tourists lining up to take a selfie on the summit the fatalities this year were more than double last year s and the estimated 810 climbers to reach the 29 029 foot high 8 848 metres peak were the most ever as the climbing season came to an end the recriminations began many focused on the loose standards set by the government of nepal and the proliferation of dubious expedition companies china also runs expeditions from its side of the mountain but fewer use that route and the controls are said to be tighter on the nepal side anyone can pick up an everest permit for 11 000 and the total package with guides equipment food and lodging for a six week expedition can easily exceed 50 000 in one of the world s poorest countries that s a flow of money the government is loath to reduce nepalese officials are belatedly considering setting proficiency standards for climbers and limiting the numbers on the mountain to reduce congestion and garbage at the summit that should happen before the next climbing season begins but however disturbing the deaths and the queues everest still poses one of the greatest physical and mental challenges our planet has to offer and trying to deny it to people is as futile today as it was when

complex financing structures for large real estate projects many traditional real estate projects involve primarily the acquisition sale or development of a single building parcel or contiguous parcels of real estate by one owner with financing from a single lender or lender group by contrast large mixed use projects often involve the development of large areas and sometimes multiple blocks of non contiguous real estate by multiple owners with various lenders and financing structures these projects frequently have complex land use and entitlement issues and a variety of ownership structures that require greater experience with corporate and business laws likewise the increased use of tax credits requires experience with tax law and the structuring of these credits and project financing in a manner compatible with the business interests of the owners developers and lenders 1 2 most significant trends some of the most significant trends in the tennessee real estate market have been i the popularity of large mixed use projects both in urban cores as part of the redevelopment of blighted areas and in suburban areas as standalone projects ii the use of tax credits

impact of new us tax law changes the primary effects from the recent tax cuts and jobs act the new tax act on real estate investment and development are as follows the allowance for non c corporation taxpayers to deduct up to 20 of their qualified business income earned through pass through businesses the increase in the long term capital gains holding period to three years for taxpayers receiving a carried or profits interest the limitation on a taxpayer s ability to deduct interest expenses up to 30 of the taxpayer s net income and limiting interest deductions for home mortgage indebtedness and home equity loans to usd750 000 from usd1 million the new tax act also limits state and local tax deductions to usd10 000 per year for married taxpayers filing jointly in certain circumstances the 20 deduction is limited to 50 of the taxpayer s allocable share of w 2 wages or 25 of the taxpayer s allocable share of w 2 wages plus 2 5 of the taxpayer s allocable share of the unadjusted basis of qualified property to be qualified property must be depreciable whichever is greater the provision for 2 5 of the unadjusted basis is beneficial to real estate investors and developers in capital intensive sectors with large capital investments and comparatively minor labor costs in addition taxpayers are allowed to deduct 20 of reit dividends without being subject to the limitations being described above the new tax act included a new incentive designed to encourage investment in qualified opportunity zones which are certain low income communities designated within each state a list of eligible census tracts in tennessee is located at this incentive allows investors to defer capital gains tax by reinvesting the gain in a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days after the creation of the gain in addition 10 of the gain is permanently forgiven if the investment is held for five years and another 5 is permanently forgiven if the investment is held for seven years finally if the investment is held for ten years the investor s basis in the asset becomes the fair market value of the asset at the time of any sale meaning the investor would pay no tax on any appreciation of the asset 2 sale and purchase 2 1 ownership structures purchasers typically acquire commercial real estate through the use of limited liability companies and corporations depending on the nature of the purchaser s business the use of single or special purpose entities that own solely commercial real estate is a common legal tactic to limit liability to such single or special purpose entity thereby protecting the assets of the purchaser s affiliates 2 2 important jurisdictional requirements no special jurisdictional rules apply to the transfer of title to real estate in tennessee statutory law does not require specific language to transfer title but does provide examples of conveyance language that is sufficient for the transfer of title by general and special warranty and quitclaim and for purposes of a deed of trust tca 66 5 103 a deed of conveyance must be acknowledged in accordance with tennessee law or proved by two sworn witnesses tca 66 5 106 sellers of residential one to four unit properties including single family homes are typically required to deliver disclosure statements to prospective purchasers containing all items set forth in tca 66 5 210 transfers of residential real estate must also comply with applicable federal laws and regulations 2 3 effecting lawful and proper transfer of title a purchaser can effectuate the transfer of title to real estate by recording its deed in the office of the register of deeds in the county where the acquired property lies the register s office records and indexes the deed according to various methods depending on the county eg grantor grantee parcel number municipal address various registers offices may provide electronic access to recorded instruments through an online database 2 4 real estate due diligence in performing their due diligence on real estate buyers typically rely on various third parties to determine the suitability of the property for their intended use engineers inspect various aspects of the existing structures on the property environmental consultants test for the presence of hazardous materials and the potential for contamination from nearby sites title agents and zoning consultants investigate the status of title to the property and its zoning compliance for the buyer s intended uses and registered licensed surveyors prepare site surveys reflecting property and improvement dimensions the presence of any encroachment onto or off the property and any other material items noted by the surveyor attorneys for buyers will primarily be responsible for a detailed review of the survey and recorded instruments affecting title a careful review of the survey and recorded instrument is critical as the buyers economic return on the property could be materially impacted by encroachments on the property zoning or setback violations or the terms of recorded instruments that may limit typical ownership rights by restricting permitted uses of the property proscribing certain architectural designs or permitting neighboring owners limited use of the buyers property eg through access easements or runoff drainage rights 2 5 typical representations and warranties for purchase and sale agreements representations and warranties are some of the most heavily negotiated provisions of commercial purchase and sale agreements which typically contain representations and warranties with respect to the seller s existence and authority to sell the property the status of the seller s title to the property pending or threatened litigation or administrative proceedings including environmental or zoning violations the seller s compliance with applicable laws any leases in effect at the property the accuracy of seller provided property information and the seller s absence from restricted lists maintained by the office of foreign asset control implied and statutory warranties do not exist with respect to transfers of title to real property but sellers commonly seek to disclaim any implied warranties and transfer property in as is condition subject only to representations and warranties expressly contained in the purchase and sale agreement if the purchase and sale agreement does not provide that a seller s representations and warranties will survive closing and delivery of the deed then the terms of the purchase and sale agreement are deemed to merge into the deed whereby the deed is deemed the final contract between the parties fraud and mutual mistake of the parties are exceptions to the doctrine of merger a buyer may generally terminate a pending purchase and sale agreement prior to closing in the event of a seller s misrepresentation assuming that the purchase and sale agreement provided for post closing survival of the seller s representations and warranties a buyer may recover its actual damages as a result of losses resulting from the misrepresentation parties to a commercial real estate sale frequently negotiate threshold amounts for buyers to recover damages for misrepresentation and maximum amounts anywhere between 1 and 10 of the purchase price over which the seller will have no liability but fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the seller are usually excluded from such contractual limitations 2 6 important areas of law for foreign investors foreign investors purchasing real estate in the usa should carefully consider the impact of potential us tax liabilities and reporting obligations incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate specific reporting obligations may stem from i the choice of entity and jurisdiction of formation as well as the transaction structure which may also have important tax consequences and may determine the purchaser s potential liability with respect to the property and its intended use ii anti money laundering laws and associated reporting requirements of the financial crimes enforcement network fincen of the us department of the treasury relating to the source of funds and method of payment and iii sanctions administered by the office of foreign asset control ofac of the us department of the treasury relating to the identity of the purchaser tax consequences and additional specific reporting obligations may result from the following any determination that income from the property is or will be effectively connected to a us trade or business the imposition of branch profits on foreign corporations if applicable the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act firpta the requirements of the us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis including the filing of either form be 15 claim for exemption or the appropriate annual report the imposition of other us income tax return requirements and filings and potential us gift and estate tax liability in addition us lenders providing any amount of financing for the purchase of real property may impose their own loan underwriting requirement as a condition of the loan such requirements may include but are not limited to the provision of additional documentation relating to the identity of the purchaser borrower the intended use of the property and the source of non loan funds being used to fund the acquisition as well as cash or security deposits to be held by the lending institution although tennessee has experienced an increase in foreign investment in real estate none of the housing markets in tennessee is currently subject to the additional disclosure requirements the financial crimes enforcement network has imposed through geographic targeting orders on title companies when foreign buyers are paying cash for high end residential properties in certain markets such as manhattan los angeles miami and san francisco however fincen encourages title companies financial institutions brokers and other professionals to voluntarily file suspicious activity reports sars in order to report any suspicious transactions or activity also a sar is required to be filed for currency and similar transactions in excess of usd10 000 2 7 soil pollution and environmental contamination under both i the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla as amended by the 1986 amendments to cercla known as the superfund amendments and reauthorization act sara and ii the tennessee hazardous waste management act of 1983 the state equivalent to cercla and sara after a buyer takes title to property it becomes a potentially responsible party prp even if the buyer did not cause or contribute to the existing pollution or contamination however in some cases cercla and sara allow the apportionment of liability for site clean up see tca 68 212 207 a buyer may prevent being declared a prp by establishing one of the following the buyer purchased the property conducted necessary environmental due diligence and later discovered an environmental issue at the site the innocent landowner defense the buyer purchased the property clearly knowing that environmental conditions existed on the property the bona fide prospective purchaser defense or the buyer purchased the property and the environmental conditions existed on an adjoining property and have or will have moved onto the purchased property the contiguous landowner defense in all cases the buyer must conduct all appropriate inquiry prior to purchasing the property and comply with any continuing obligations related to the allowable use of the property and the management of existing pollution 2 8 permitted uses of real estate under zoning and planning law even though local jurisdictions often maintain zoning maps zoning ordinances and development codes online that permit a buyer to research and identify the permitted uses of a parcel under zoning or planning law a buyer should also contact the relevant zoning authority to obtain a zoning letter confirming those uses for the subject parcel alternatively buyers often engage a third party service to prepare a planning and zoning report for the target property which is often more informative than zoning letters and will include information on zoning compliance special use permits and other details that might prove helpful in the due diligence process larger urban jurisdictions will have capable planning staff that are able to assist with technical compliance with the zoning and planning laws smaller and rural jurisdictions ordinarily do not have extensive planning and zoning restrictions tennessee and its local jurisdictions enjoy wide latitude to approve developments including entering into development agreements with developers and provide public development incentives 2 9 condemnation expropriation or compulsory purchase tennessee permits eminent domain by a condemning authority eg the tennessee department of transportation public utility and in certain limited situations a person or corporation for public purposes or internal improvements but not a private purpose eminent domain is commenced by filing a petition in circuit court against all persons with an interest in the property notice must be given upon the filing of a petition just compensation based on the fair market value of the property will be determined in court or by agreement overall tennessee is fairly permissive regarding the condemning authority s exercise of the power of eminent domain 2 10 taxes applicable to a transaction in the case of a warranty deed transferring title to real property the recording of the deed requires payment of a recordation tax sometimes referred to as a transfer tax equal to usd0 37 per usd100 of either the consideration for the transfer or the fair market value of the property whichever is greater the recording of a quitclaim deed requires payment of a tax equal to usd0 37 per usd100 of the actual consideration given for the conveyance register offices also assess nominal per page recording fees which vary by county buyers pay the transfer tax on sales of real property in tennessee but seek to offset the transfer tax by negotiating other closing cost divisions particularly in commercial transactions the deed tax does not apply in limited situations such as transfers between spouses or deeds from executors of estates mergers changes of control or transfers of equity ownership in property owning entities are not subject to transfer tax 2 11 rules and regulations applicable to foreign investors see 2 6 important areas of law for foreign investors 3 real estate finance 3 1 financing acquisitions of commercial real estate tennessee commercial real estate transactions do not offer any unique financing options or strategies buyer borrowers frequently utilize traditional term financing bridge and construction financing and for buyers pursuing a series of property acquisitions or developments lines of credit for larger ongoing credit facilities lenders arrange financing through syndication or participation rates of interest loan charges and commissions in commercial lending transactions governed by tennessee law are generally subject to a maximum formula rate published monthly by the tennessee department of financial institutions which is 4 over the average prime rate however through a relatively complex statutory framework federally chartered banks and tennessee chartered banks may charge interest of up to 24 annually one of the main differences between financing structures in public and private entities is that public entities may also depend on investment through publicly traded securities on the stock market many public real estate entities are set up as reits whereby investors pool their money to build a real estate portfolio which also operates as a publicly traded stock a public reit in particular may enjoy potentially higher returns and greater liquidity from being traded on the stock market private entities may also be set up as reits but are not publicly traded on the other hand this may allow private reits to avoid the potential volatility of the stock market for more steady and less risky returns 3 2 typical security created by commercial investors tennessee law permits a commercial real estate investor to grant several types of security interests to creditors for the purpose of borrowing funds to acquire or develop real property but deeds of trust are the customary form of security instrument for real estate finance tennessee is a title theory state with respect to real property security interests meaning that legal title to real property is conveyed by the borrower via a deed of trust to a trustee on behalf of the lender the borrower retains equitable title to the property including rights of possession and income the deed of trust is filed in the register of deeds office in the county where the property is located typically a lender will also require a separate assignment of leases and rents from the borrower whereby i the borrower absolutely assigns all leases including all borrower s rights thereunder and rents related to the secured property as additional collateral for the debt and ii the lender grants the borrower a revocable license to operate as the landlord and collect such rents under such leases until a default the assignment of leases and rents is also filed in the register of deeds office in the county where the property is located the tennessee uniform commercial code ucc permits creditors to file financing statements with the tennessee secretary of state s office to provide notice of their security interest in a debtor s property furthermore although most deeds of trust include language creating a security interest in the fixtures attached to the real property creditors commonly file a separate ucc 1 fixture filing financing statement in the register of deeds office with respect to the secured fixtures 3 3 regulations or requirements affecting foreign lenders out of state lenders are generally not required to be qualified to do business in tennessee in order to make a typical commercial loan secured by real estate the creation or acquisition of indebtedness deeds of trust mortgages and security interests in property and the securing or collecting of debts or enforcing of deeds of trust and security interests in property do not constitute transacting of business by themselves in the state and thus do not require a non tennessee corporate entity to be qualified to do business in tennessee except for those activities that do not constitute transacting business in tennessee under tca 48 25 101 and certain others non tennessee corporate entities must qualify to do business in tennessee after obtaining a certificate of authority to transact business from the tennessee secretary of state non tennessee corporate entities must also register with the tennessee department of revenue for franchise and excise taxes within 90 days out of state lenders are typically not required to be licensed or registered with the tennessee department of financial institutions or other state agencies tennessee requires trustees who hold legal title to secured real property on behalf of a lender to be one of the following a tennessee resident a tennessee corporation or non tennessee corporation whose principal place of business is tennessee or an individual whose principal place of employment is in tennessee tennessee also allows a resident of a non tennessee state to serve as trustee if such non tennessee state permits tennessee residents to serve as trustees 3 4 taxes or fees relating to the granting of enforcement of security the recording of an instrument evidencing indebtedness eg a deed of trust or ucc 1 financing statement whether at the county or state level requires payment of an indebtedness tax equal to usd0 115 per usd100 of indebtedness excluding the first usd2 000 of indebtedness which is exempt from the tax calculation 3 5 legal requirements before an entity can give valid security tennessee does not maintain any financial assistance or corporate benefit rules with respect to real estate assets 3 6 formalities when a borrower is in default tennessee allows judicial foreclosure and non judicial foreclosure upon the default of a loan secured by a deed of trust or mortgage judicial foreclosure proceedings are rarely used as most real estate financing is secured by a deed of trust that allows for power of sale through non judicial foreclosure a deed of trust or mortgage must be properly executed acknowledged and recorded with the register of the county in which the realty affected is located a properly recorded deed of trust or mortgage provides constructive notice to all persons and will establish priority over subsequent liens and interests careful drafting of the deed of trust should include provisions that accelerate the debt upon default and waive the right to redemption non judicial foreclosure proceedings are initiated by providing the debtor with notice of default next the creditor must publish notice of the foreclosure sale at least three times in a newspaper published in the county where the property is located and in compliance with any additional requirements in the deed of trust a non judicial foreclosure sale must comply strictly with the language in the deed of trust the notice of foreclosure sale must include information such as the names of interested parties a description of the property the time and place of the foreclosure sale and other related items tennessee law requires the trustee to search for state tax liens on the property and also governs the manner and timing of the sale process specifics may be found in tca 35 5 101 et seq non judicial foreclosure in tennessee typically requires around 30 days from start to finish 3 7 subordinating existing debt to newly created debt the holder of a deed of trust or mortgage may consensually subordinate its lien by contract pursuant to a subordination agreement the subordination agreement should be recorded in the same manner as the original deed of trust or mortgage in order to be valid against third parties also taxes assessed upon real property are a first lien that takes priority over existing recorded liens including a deed of trust if taxes are assessed on something other than real property the existing recorded lien will still have priority over a subsequently recorded tax lien mechanics and materialmen s liens may also take priority over a recorded lien including a deed of trust if i the mechanic or materialman gives notice to the lienholder prior to beginning work on real property improvements or delivering goods and ii the lienholder does not object within ten days tca 66 11 108 in the absence of such notice or upon an objection the mechanics and materialmen s liens are subordinate to properly recorded liens 3 8 lender s liability under environmental laws a lender holding or enforcing security over real estate may be liable under environmental laws even if it did not cause any pollution of the real estate under federal laws or the laws of tennessee if it engages in active participation in the management of a facility active participation must be more than the mere capacity or ability to influence or the unexercised right to control a site vessel or facility operations and requires actual participation in the management or operational affairs by the holder of the security interest the tennessee waste hazardous waste reduction act of 1990 the tennessee superfund act generally follows the provisions of the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 sara which afford certain liability protections to lenders that are not active participants in the management of a facility tca 68 212 301 et seq 2018 examples of active participation include exercising decision making control over hazardous waste disposal or assuming day to day responsibility with respect to environmental compliance or operational aspects of a business tca 68 212 401 1 a if a lender s indicia of ownership are held primarily to protect a security interest they do not indicate active participation tca 68 212 401 b under this statute an owner may take emergency response actions when needed to address an immediate threat to the environment or public health or to conduct an environmental audit or inspection without jeopardizing its non management status tca 68 212 404 b in the event of a foreclosure a holder of a security interest will continue to be considered as an un active participant provided that the holder undertakes to sell re lease or otherwise divest itself of the property or facility in an expeditious manner tca 68 212 403 3 9 effects of borrower becoming insolvent the automatic stay effective upon the filing of a federal bankruptcy petition will stay all foreclosure actions against a debtor s real property furthermore under tennessee law a non judicial foreclosure becomes final upon execution of a trustee s deed to the purchaser not upon final oral cry at the non judicial foreclosure sale or upon a memorandum of sale if a federal bankruptcy petition is filed any time before the execution of a trustee s deed the foreclosure action will be automatically stayed by bankruptcy and the lienholder will be forced to proceed in the federal courts to get relief from the automatic stay before finalizing the foreclosure under tennessee law furthermore federal bankruptcy law will allow a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to avoid i any lien that has not been properly recorded in a timely manner under tennessee law or ii a lien that was given for less than reasonably equivalent value while insolvent or other fraud tennessee allows fraudulent liens to be avoided any time within four years after the lien attaches the primary protection against bankruptcy risks is a disciplined credit program a lender should understand its risks before deciding to lend in addition timely perfected security interests in collateral with real value assure that a loan will be repaid even in the event of bankruptcy most efforts to contract around bankruptcy will be determined void as against federal bankruptcy policy 4 planning and zoning 4 1 legislative and governmental controls applicable to design appearance and method of construction tennessee and its political subdivisions use a variety of legislative and governmental controls or regulations such as county municipal and historical zoning laws and building ordinances that govern design appearance and construction methods of new buildings and refurbishments at the regional and municipal level these regulations commonly affect set back rules height restrictions floor area ratios impacting density and parking additionally historical zoning commissions exist at the county or municipal level in any area of the state served by a regional planning commission the local legislative bodies of the region served by such commission may create a regional historic zoning commission the growth and construction of non residential or multi family residential buildings located in areas of historical significance are also regulated counties have the authority to create design review commissions which then may develop general guidelines for the exterior appearance of and entrance to properties located in historical areas the design review commission will often be the same as the planning commission 4 2 regulatory authorities regional and municipal planning and zoning commissions are typically responsible for regulating the development and designated use of individual parcels of real estate in tennessee additionally the tennessee department of economic and community development is responsible for creating and establishing planning regions including the creation of regional planning commissions throughout the state which are composed of one or more contiguous counties regional planning commissions are charged with promoting mutual co operation among any municipal planning commissions and the regional commission the regional planning commission also advises municipal and county mayors legislative bodies and officials on the status of development of the region smaller scale community planning commissions also exist with similar power and responsibilities the chief legislative body of any municipality has the authority to create and establish a municipal planning commission which may make reports and recommendations relating to the plan and development of the municipality to public officials and agencies public utility companies civic educational professional and other organizations and citizens it may recommend programs for public improvements and financing to the executive or legislative officials of the municipality the types of legal restrictions and requirements on development and use of real estate include regulations promulgated by the regional and municipal planning commissions examples of requirements include plat approval and building permitting there are also county municipal and historic zoning regulations which vary but are generally enacted for the purpose of promoting the health safety morals convenience order prosperity and welfare of the present and future inhabitants of the state and of its counties they seek to lessen congestion on the roads secure safety from fire and other dangers promote adequate light and air prevent excessive concentrations of the population as well as excessive and wasteful scattering of the population promote land development and utilization in a way that will tend to facilitate and conserve adequate provisions for transportation water flow water supply drainage sanitation educational opportunity recreation soil fertility food supply and the protection of both urban and non urban development and identify areas where there are inadequate or nonexistent services and facilities the chief legislative body of a municipality is responsible for enacting zoning ordinances which regulate the location height bulk number of stories and size of buildings and other structures the amount of a lot that may be occupied the sizes of yards the density of population and the use of buildings at the neighborhood level pursuant to tennessee s neighborhood preservation act owners of residential property are required to maintain the exterior of such property and the lot in accordance with community standards of other residential property in the area 4 3 obtaining entitlements to develop a new project the process for obtaining entitlements to develop a new project or to complete a major refurbishment in tennessee includes submitting preliminary and schematic plans to the appropriate planning commission for approval the commission will review and approve or disapprove of a plan often requiring changes which can then be re submitted for approval once made plans are subject to a public hearing where third parties may support or object to the plan with respect to historically zoned areas all applications for permits for construction alteration repair rehabilitation relocation or demolition of any building or structure or for other improvements to real estate situated within a historic zone or district are referred to the local historic zoning commission or the regional historic zoning commission which has broad powers to request detailed construction plans and related data pertinent to a thorough review of the proposal the applicable zoning commission is also authorized to review construction or alteration plans even where a permit is not required affected parties have the right to participate on or object to planning decisions any person aggrieved or any officer department board or bureau of the municipality affected by any grant or refusal of a building permit has the ability to appeal to the zoning commission although zoning codes differ across municipalities in tennessee in the major urban areas the process to re zone property is complicated and time consuming normally requiring a pre application conference neighborhood meeting formal application planning department review and hearing and a hearing and decision by the governing body this process takes several months at minimum the process to obtain a variance is less complicated and less time consuming and primarily requires an application review and recommendation by the planning department and a hearing and decision by the board of adjustment this process typically takes several months 4 4 right of appeal against an authority s decision each county and municipality has the authority to create a board of zoning appeals which has the power to hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by an individual that there is error in any order requirement permit decision or refusal made by the applicable commissioner or any other administrative official in the carrying out or enforcement of any provision of any ordinance at the planning commission level if the applicable commission approves or disapproves a development plat after a hearing thereon then the applicant submitting the plat or any person who was a party for or against the plat who so requests at the planning commission hearing has the right within 30 days of such approval or disapproval to have the action of the planning commission reviewed by the appropriate municipal legislative body which shall approve or disapprove the development plans by majority vote any further appeal would proceed in the chancery or circuit court property owners affected by historical zoning guidelines or who do not comply with the guidelines may appeal a decision of the design review committee or the county building commissioner to the county board of zoning appeals 4 5 agreements with local or governmental authorities it is possible in tennessee to enter into agreements with local or governmental authorities or agencies or utility suppliers in order to facilitate a development project such arrangements typically take the form of participation agreements or development agreements with the applicable municipality or utility or even the planning department in order to effectuate certain types of projects eg parks roads infrastructure and other public developments that can be built more efficiently with the use of a private developer these arrangements are often complicated because of state procurement and public competitive bidding requirements the department of general services oversees the central procurement office in tennessee and administers manages and ensures the compliance of procured contracts the office has an online database of all ongoing procurements their statuses and contracts by state agencies departments and institutions the department manages construction of state capital projects which comprise most of tennessee s construction and maintenance projects across the state 4 6 enforcement of restrictions on development and designated use public agencies in the state have the administrative authority to remedy noncompliance with planning regulations or zoning ordinances for example a zoning board has the ability to institute an injunction mandamus abatement or other appropriate action to prevent enjoin or remove an unlawful construction alteration maintenance or use of any real property in violation of a zoning commission s regulations is a misdemeanor with each day that an illegal construction or use of land or structure exists being a separate offense 5 investment vehicles 5 1 types of entities available to investors to hold real estate assets real estate owners may hold title to their property through limited liability companies corporations limited partnerships limited liability partnerships or general partnerships or in their individual names limited liability companies and corporations are most frequently used due to the familiarity of investors and lenders with their organisational structure and their inherent liability protection 5 2 main features of the constitution of each type of entity the extensive body of law governing the management capital structure and fiduciary responsibilities of corporate officers and directors offers the principal advantage of the corporate ownership structure of real estate these features decrease transaction costs and can expedite the formation and closing timelines in property related private equity offerings or financing transactions however continuing development and the increasing ubiquity of limited liability companies have allowed legal counsel and clients to craft greater organisational flexibility while maintaining as simple or sophisticated a capital structure as is necessitated by the given transaction general partnerships and individual ownership of commercial property are infrequent due primarily to the unlimited liability exposure each owner faces with respect to the property but their use allows owners to avoid tennessee franchise and excise taxes on the real property in addition a limited liability vehicle such as an llc may elect to be an obligated member entity simply to avoid tennessee franchise and excise taxes 5 3 tax benefits and costs the inefficiency of the double taxation regime applicable to standard c corporations is the largest tax disadvantage to selecting such corporate structure for ownership of an income producing real estate asset however in certain contexts owners may be able to elect subchapter s treatment under the internal revenue code and receive pass through tax treatment on earnings absent the affirmative election to be taxed as a corporation limited liability companies offer the default benefit of pass through tax treatment on earnings 5 4 applicable governance requirements the governance structure of corporations is characterised by management by a board of directors and the day to day operations of the corporation are carried out by officers shareholders of a corporation typically have no management rights but they have voting rights with respect to the election of directors and certain significant corporate transactions such as merger dissolution and a sale of substantially all the assets of the corporation the governance structures of tennessee limited liability companies are variegated and such entities may be managed by their members a manager or a board of managers or a board of directors limited liability companies may also employ officers to oversee day to day operations default statutory rules apply in the case of corporations and limited liability companies but tennessee law provides a much greater degree of flexibility in the drafting of documents governing limited liability companies management and governance rights when compared to default statutory rules 6 commercial leases 6 1 types of arrangements allowing the use of real estate for a limited period of time tennessee law broadly recognizes three arrangements under which a person company or other organization may occupy and use real estate for a limited period of time without buying it outright by lease by easement and by license under a lease arrangement one party the lessor or landlord leases real property to another party lessee or tenant and grants the right of exclusive possession thereof for a period of time in exchange for a consideration which most often takes the form of rent leases with a term of more than one year must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought in order for leases with a term of more than three years to be binding on anyone other than the landlord the landlord s heirs and devisees or third parties with actual notice they or memoranda thereof must be registered in the county where the subject property is located in accordance with the requirements of the tennessee recording statutes tca 66 24 101 et seq in tennessee a lease constitutes an interest in real property an easement is also considered an interest in real property and confers upon its owner the right to use the property of another for a particular purpose to be enforceable easements created by agreement must be in writing and to be binding upon subsequent purchasers or interest holders without notice they must be registered in the county where the property is located in accordance with the requirements of the tennessee recording statutes a license confers to the licensee only a personal right to undertake specific activities on the licensor s real property with or without corresponding obligations a license is generally revocable and in the absence of express language to the contrary cannot be transferred or assigned unlike the lease and the easement a license does not create an interest in land and is not governed by the statute of frauds and thus does not need to be in writing 6 2 types of commercial leases commercial leases often take different forms depending on the use of the leased premises a lease for an office in an office building will be substantially different from a lease of warehouse space in an industrial park or retail space in a shopping center or commercial space in a single tenant property there are different considerations protections for the landlord representations and warranties and different ways to handle the charges to be paid by the tenant there are multiple options with respect to the charges to be paid by the tenant including gross ie fully serviced net modified gross and percentage a gross lease is where the landlord pays for the property taxes insurance and maintenance and the tenant pays a single flat fee a net lease is the opposite of a gross lease there are three types of net leases single net double net and triple net a single net lease is where the tenant is responsible for rent and property taxes a double net lease is where the tenant is responsible for rent property taxes and insurance and a triple net lease is where the tenant is responsible for rent property taxes insurance and maintenance a modified gross lease is a hybrid between a gross lease and a net lease a percentage lease is where the tenant pays base rent as well as a percentage of revenue earned from its business on the property a ground lease is where the tenant pays rent and also constructs improvements on the property during the term of the lease after which the land and improvements are turned over to the landlord ground leases typically have longer terms 6 3 regulation of rents of lease terms neither rents nor lease terms are regulated in tennessee with the exception of certain limitations placed on the term for oil and gas leases tennessee law generally limits the term of such leases to a maximum of ten years from the date of execution unless natural gas or oil is being produced for commercial purposes at the expiration of the ten year period tca 66 7 103 6 4 typical terms of a lease although most terms for commercial leases are the product of negotiation a lease term of five to ten years with renewal options is not uncommon ground leases and build to suit leases typically have longer terms typically the landlord is responsible for the maintenance and repair of any common areas of the building or shopping center for structural components of the building demised premises and for any utility lines to the boundary of the demised premises tenants are typically responsible for all maintenance and repair within the demised premises rent is often paid in advance at the beginning of each month but leases in tennessee must expressly state that rent shall be paid in advance contrary to the common law presumption 6 5 rent variation the rents are determined by the terms of the lease agreement many rental rates increase during the term particularly for terms of longer duration 6 6 determination of changes in rent rent escalations are determined by the lease contract the terms may include rent escalation provisions that cause the rent to increase annually based upon agreed percentages with 2 of 3 being typical or upon market indicators such as increase in fair market value or increases in the consumer price index all rent provisions must include a key that allows for the rent amount to be objectively determined 6 7 payment of vat no vat or other taxes or governmental levy is payable on rent 6 8 costs payable by tenant at the start of lease at the start of a lease the tenant may be responsible for a security deposit any application fees and the first month s rent in some instances the landlord could require first and last month s rent tenants are sometimes responsible for the build out of the leased premises and the corresponding outlay of funds to prepare the premises for occupancy in other cases a landlord might provide an improvement allowance to the tenant to pay for the build out which would be less likely to result in a pre occupancy tenant expenditure the allowance amount is usually a negotiated rate per square foot of the leased premises capital improvements in a lease are typically paid for by the landlord however the lease may be negotiated such that certain capital expenses such as improvements to reduce operating costs or comply with applicable laws are passed through to the tenant and amortized over a certain period 6 9 payment for maintenance and repair common area expenses including maintenance and repair costs for parking lots and landscaping for example are often divided among the multiple tenants in proportion to the amount of space leased unless the rent is structured as a full service gross arrangement where tenant pays a set all inclusive rent tenants will usually pay a monthly estimate of these common area expenses or cam expenses to the landlord in addition to monthly base rent payments all of the common expenses for these areas are estimated and amortized over the lease year the landlord will typically be responsible for maintaining the common areas in good working order and condition but will recoup those fees and costs from the funds paid by each tenant for cam expenses 6 10 payment for services utilities and telecommunications the payment of services utilities and telecommunications that serve a property occupied by several tenants will likely be determined by whether the separate premises are separately metered where separately metered it is common for tenants to pay utilities directly if not separately metered the landlord will usually pay utilities and assess the tenants proportionately or build utilities costs into the base rent the negotiated contract will establish specific utilities payments 6 11 insuring real estate that is the subject of a lease various considerations will determine whether the landlord or the tenant ultimately insures the property including which entity can negotiate lower pricing and better coverage a multi tenant site will usually be insured by the landlord with costs passed to the tenants while a single tenant site may be insured by the tenant most events causing damages are insured through an all risk or special form property policy special endorsements exist in areas where there are high risks of earthquakes or other special casualty events 6 12 restrictions on the use of real estate lease terms affecting a tenant s use of the premises are frequently negotiated points in commercial leases restrictions may generally be imposed within the lease in the form of a narrow permitted use provision general terms aimed at minimising risk or property damage or generally applicable rules and regulations that may be amended from time to time by the landlord tenants will often expressly be required to use the premises in accordance with all laws tennessee allows for local governments to regulate use through zoning laws but use restrictions may also arise from private covenants and restrictions easement agreements and other recorded instruments governing or restricting the use of property 6 13 tenant s ability to alter of improve real estate the right to make improvements is often a heavily negotiated lease term depending on the type of demised premises the landlord usually wants control or consent rights over any improvements to the premises during the lease term and will usually specify what work can be performed to the demised premises and can cap the work at a certain dollar threshold or require prior written consent for work beyond a dollar threshold 6 14 specific regulations residential leases in shelby davidson knox and other populous counties must comply with the tennessee uniform residential landlord and tenant act which protects residential tenants from certain actions of a landlord most provisions of commercial leases however are creatures of contract law that override the default landlord tenant laws 6 15 effect of tenant s insolvency a tenant s insolvency may cause default under a lease but federal bankruptcy law will ignore as void any insolvency provision in a lease if bankruptcy is sought section 365 of the bankruptcy code states that a debtor tenant may assume assign or reject the lease assumption of the lease is a decision to retain or continue the lease by the bankruptcy estate whereas a rejection is a decision to terminate the tenant must cure any lease defaults and assure future performance under the lease before assuming or assigning the lease 6 16 forms of security to protect against tenant s failure to meet obligations typically a landlord will collect a security deposit at the beginning of the lease term for a month or several months of rent payments upon default a landlord may liquidate the security deposit and use it to cover some of the tenant s obligations under the lease a tenant may also be required to provide an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution if the tenant defaults the landlord can draw upon the letter of credit to satisfy outstanding rental obligations furthermore for the same reasons a tenant may also be required to provide a personal guarantee from the principal a parent guaranty or some other credit enhancement 6 17 right to occupy after termination of expiration of lease a tenant does not have a right to occupy the premises outside the stated lease term however most commercial leases will contain a holdover provision that converts the tenancy at expiration to a tenancy at will with an increased rental amount this holdover rent is usually high enough to discourage the tenant s continued possession in order to recover possession where the tenant fails to surrender the premises a landlord will need to terminate the lease seek a forcible entry and detainer against the tenant and obtain a writ of possession a lease should specify that abandonment of the premises allows the landlord to re enter take possession and terminate the lease 6 18 right to terminate lease an event of default that could result in termination of the lease is governed by the terms of the lease nonpayment is the most common event of default events of default should also include the breach of any material provision in the lease upon an event of default a lease will often require the non defaulting party to provide notice to the defaulting party and give a reasonable cure period if the event of default is uncured the right to terminate should be permitted abandonment should also give a right to terminate the lease failure to pay taxes material changes or termination of insurance and unauthorised or illegal uses of the premises will ordinarily provide a right of termination it is also common to have anti assignment provisions that cause termination of the lease the lease should also specify rights to termination upon certain casualty or condemnation events 6 19 forced eviction in the event of default prior to the expiration date a tenant can be forced to vacate the leased premises through the process of eviction even though most leases contain a covenant allowing the lessor to re enter the premises and remove a tenant upon default tennessee prohibits landlords from exercising self help instead a writ of possession must be obtained through the eviction process the typical eviction process is a forcible entry and detainer action in general sessions court or circuit court the time of trial may not be less than six days from the date of service of the summons on the tenant in accordance with tca 29 18 115 a writ of possession for the recovery of the property from the tenant will not be issued against the tenant until ten days after judgment is rendered in favor of the landlord the tenant may appeal within ten days tca 29 18 101 et seq 6 20 termination by third party the government or a municipal authority may terminate a lease by condemnation which occurs when part or all of the leased premises are taken for a public purpose by an entity with the power of eminent domain most leases include a condemnation clause that provides for what will occur in the event condemnation occurs any rents paid in advance prior to any condemnation are required to be refunded to the tenant a senior lender cannot terminate a lease unless it has such right in the lease or a separate subordination non disturbance and attornment agreement for example if the lender has foreclosed on its leasehold mortgage and replaces its borrower as the tenant under the lease pursuant to certain leasehold mortgagee provisions in the lease the lender may have termination rights pursuant to such provisions 7 construction 7 1 common structures used to price construction projects commonly used pricing structures for construction projects include the following fixed price sometimes referred to as lump sum cost plus where the price is based on the actual cost of labor and materials plus a fixed or percentage fee for the contractor s overhead and profit and cost plus with a guaranteed maximum price or gmp where the contractor agrees that the actual cost plus the fee will not exceed a certain guaranteed maximum price unit prices may be used as a component of fixed price and cost plus contracts 7 2 assigning responsibility for the design and construction of a project responsibility for the design of most projects is allocated to the architect through an agreement between the owner and the architect and responsibility for the construction of the project is allocated to the contractor through a separate agreement between the owner and the contractor the allocation of certain design responsibilities is frequently negotiated among the parties for example responsibility for site and foundation work may be assigned to an engineer that has contracted directly with the owner likewise design responsibility for shop drawings and submittals during construction is often negotiated and sometimes shared by the architect and the contractor for projects utilizing the design build method of project delivery the design builder is responsible for both the design and the construction of the project 7 3 management of construction risk construction risk is primarily managed through the contractual provisions between the owner and the contractor most construction contracts including the popular american institute of architects aia contract documents include basic warranties and indemnification provisions the scope of and exclusions from these provisions are often negotiated indemnification provisions are enforceable under tennessee law subject to certain limitations and requirements tennessee recognises the nearly universal rule that there can be no recovery where there was concurrent negligence of both the indemnitor and the indemnitee unless the indemnity contract provides for indemnification in such case by clear and unequivocal terms and general words will not be read as expressing such intent kroger co v giem 387 sw 2d 620 624 tenn 1964 also an indemnity provision in a construction contract that purports to indemnify a party for damages caused by such party s sole negligence would be void under tennessee law as being against public policy tca 62 6 123 although responsibility of construction risk is primarily contractual the management of construction risk generally begins prior to the commencement of construction through the selection of the project team including evaluation of the experience and financial strength of the contractor and design professional the selection of the project delivery method and pre construction testing and other services as discussed below construction risks may also be managed or mitigated through retainage liquidated damages and payment and performance bonds 7 4 management of schedule related risk construction schedule related risk is managed through contractual provisions and the possible use of liquidated damages for delays owners should consider including a no damage for delay clause which provides that an extension of time is the sole remedy of the contractor in the event of a delay also the contract may include financial incentives for the early completion of a project or an acceleration provision giving the owner the right to demand acceleration of the project the development of the project schedule and negotiation of events or circumstances allowing for extensions of the contract time are key components of managing schedule related risks liquidated damages clauses providing for the payment of a stipulated amount of damages for the failure of a contractor to complete a project or reach a certain milestone in a timely manner are enforceable in tennessee provided that the stipulated amount is a reasonable estimate of damages at the time the parties entered into the contract 7 5 additional forms of security to guarantee a contractor s performance payment and performance bonds are sometimes required by owners to provide security for the contractor s performance under the contract and payment of its subcontractors and materialmen some owners do not require payment and performance bonds as the cost of these bonds is generally passed through to the owner but such bonds are frequently required by lenders providing construction financing public projects in tennessee require payment and performance bonds and some public projects also require bid bonds although less common a letter of credit or parent company guarantee is sometimes provided by a contractor as an alternative to payment and performance bonds retainage of a small percentage of each progress payment is commonly used to protect the owner in tennessee retainage is limited to 5 of the gross amount of the contract by the tennessee prompt pay act of 1991 tca 66 34 101 et seq if the prime contract is usd500 000 or more the retainage must be deposited by the owner into a separate interest bearing escrow account tca 66 34 104 this requirement cannot be waived or modified by contract and the interest earned on the account is the property of the contractor 7 6 liens or encumbrances in the event of non payment contractors materialmen architects and others making improvements to the real property have statutory lien rights in tennessee however only prime contractors have lien rights on residential property consisting of one to four units these liens relate back to the visible commencement of operations excluding demolition surveying and certain site work a construction loan secured by a deed of trust recorded prior to the visible commencement of operations has priority over mechanics and materialmen s liens which can be removed by posting a bond to indemnify against the lien 7 7 requirements before use of inhabitation the process for obtaining a certificate of occupancy varies according to the location of the project most local jurisdictions have inspection requirements before a certificate of occupancy will be issued and a temporary certificate of occupancy is sometimes issued when the project is substantially complete under tennessee law ubstantial completion means that degree of completion of a project improvement or a specified area or portion thereof in accordance with the contract documents as modified by any change orders agreed to by the parties upon attainment of which the owner can use the same for the purpose for which it was intended tca 28 3 201 2 additionally state and federal government inspections and approvals may be required for certain projects such as healthcare facilities 8 tax 8 1 sale or purchase of corporate real estate tennessee levies a transfer tax on deeds upon recording customarily paid by the grantee for warranty deeds it is usd0 37 per usd100 of the consideration for the transfer or the fair market value of the property whichever is greater for quitclaim deeds it is usd0 37 per usd100 of the actual consideration for the transfer there are multiple exemptions to the transfer tax including transfers between spouses or deeds from executors of estates tca 67 4 409 no federal or local transfer taxes are payable on the sale or purchase of corporate real estate 8 2 mitigation of tax liability because all transfers of realty by deed or other instrument are taxable by tennessee except for the handful of explicit exceptions that do not apply in most commercial transactions the only methods commonly used to mitigate the cost of the transfer tax are the structuring of transactions as mergers changes of control or transfers of equity ownership in property owning entities however buyers structuring indirect property acquisitions in such a manner so as to avoid transfer taxes are then faced with the additional complexity of limiting their exposure to the seller entity s existing liabilities 8 3 municipal taxes with few exceptions tennessee levies a business tax on gross receipts of all businesses that sell goods or services businesses must obtain a business license from the county or municipality and report gross receipts to the tennessee department of revenue on annual returns most municipalities including nashville memphis knoxville and chattanooga have adopted additional copycat business taxes on gross receipts exemptions apply to nonprofit religious medical farm charitable legal educational domestic accounting services architecture engineering surveying and veterinary entities and entities that generate less than usd10 000 in sales 8 4 income tax withholding for foreign investors tennessee does not have an income tax when a non us person disposes of an interest in us real estate the proceeds are subject to 15 withholding under the foreign investment in real property tax act firpta the amount of withholding can be adjusted by obtaining a withholding certificate from the internal revenue service 8 5 tax benefits the primary tax benefit from owning real estate is that property taxes paid are deductible for federal income tax purposes while land is not depreciable improvements to land are subject to depreciation this depreciation is deductible on the owner s federal income tax return owners may also take advantage of the irc section 1031 exchange rules assuming all conditions are satisfied 8 6 key changes in federal tax reform please see 1 3 impact of new us tax law changes chambers usa regional real estate guide the

central banks are resuming their first responder role as the world economy runs into trouble even if they lack the firepower they once had at their disposal with australia cutting interest rates on tuesday for the first time in three years and india likely to follow on thursday monetary policymakers are again seeking to shore up weak growth and inflation us federal reserve chairman jerome powell signalled an openness to loosening if necessary and european central bank officials are poised on thursday to at the very least agree on generous terms for new long term loans for banks the upshot is global monetary policy is turning looser just months after the us federal reserve and many of its counterparts seemed intent on spending 2019 shifting away from the emergency settings of the past decade an index by the council on foreign relations shows monetary policy is now at its easiest since 2014 while jpmorgan chase co believes the average benchmark rate of developed nations will end this year looser than now led by two us federal reserve cuts that is the outlook finance ministers and central bankers from the group of 20 g20 industrial and emerging economies face when they gather this week in the japanese city of fukuoka the mood regarding global growth is likely to be distinctly gloomier than at the last g20 gathering said matthew goodman a former white house official now at the centre for strategic and international studies this could put pressure on finance ministries and central banks in major economies to inject new stimulus worryingly officials will convene in the knowledge that they have less ammunition and monetary policy is not as potent as it once was since the 2008 financial crisis analysts at the bank of america calculate central banks cut rates more than 700 times and bought us 12 trillion of financial assets the us federal reserve has a current rate target range of 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent but with below target inflation and slowing growth investors are betting on action and see two quarter point cuts in the us by the end of 2019 jpmorgan this week pushed back its prediction for when central banks across europe will start tightening and abn amro sees quantitative easing being restarted in the euro region next year on monday st louis federal reserve president james bullard said a downward policy rate adjustment could be needed soon powell said a day later that policymakers will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion in south africa the policy bias is shifting with two of five panel members voting for a cut last month still even after the economy shrank the most in a decade in the first quarter south african reserve bank governor lesetja kganyago is adamant it is not his job to boost growth but control inflation price stability is a necessary condition for balanced and sustainable growth but it is by no means a sufficient condition kganyago said behind the global concerns and market jitters are us president donald trump s trade war with china and threats to expand it to include allies such as mexico and the european union morgan stanley is warning that an escalation of the conflict between beijing or washington alone could tip the world into recession within nine months the trade war is not the only drag on demand cooling demand in china tighter financial conditions and a dimming technology boom are also hurting manufacturing is now the weakest it has been since 2012 according to a monthly report from ihs markit the slowdown may lead some to argue central banks should have been quicker to normalise policy so they were better positioned to deal with a downturn but policymakers reject such a strategy arguing too fast tightening would risk generating the very economic slump they want to avoid however another round of loosening will fan the debate over whether they have the right strategy us federal reserve officials are meeting in chicago this week to discuss potential changes to how they manage monetary policy with at least one delegate advocating a more flexible approach to targeting inflation adam posen a former member of the bank of england monetary policy committee last month advocated all major central banks unite to boost their targets that is all for the long term rather than the short term the current situation may mean governments have to step up though they are also constrained global debt is at us 184 trillion the equivalent of 225 per cent of gross domestic product according to the international monetary fund the dilemma is perhaps greatest in g20 host japan with bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda again under pressure to act after exports fell for a fifth straight month and a planned sales tax increase has drawn warnings it could cause a recession as

the international monetary fund imf cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for china to 6 2 on wednesday on heightened uncertainty around trade frictions saying more policy easing would be warranted if the sino u s trade war escalates the downgrade came just two months after the imf raised its china forecast to 6 3 from 6 2 partly on then brightening prospects for a trade deal with the united states it also cut the growth forecast for 2020 to 6 from 6 1 a sudden escalation in the trade dispute last month underlined the risks for the world s second biggest economy from higher u s tariffs on billions of dollars of chinese goods washington has levied higher tariffs on a total of 250 billion of chinese imports since mid 2018 accusing china of forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft china which denies the accusations has retaliated with tariffs on about 110 billion of u s goods growth is expected to moderate to 6 2 and 6 0 in 2019 and 2020 respectively imf deputy managing director david lipton said in a statement the near term outlook remains particularly uncertain given the potential for further escalation of trade tensions u s president donald trump has threatened to slap tariffs of up to 25 on an additional list of chinese imports worth about 300 billion the trade war has already upended global supply chains and hurt world growth economists say the tariffs will curb growth in the united states and china and financial markets worry a protracted dispute could tip the world economy into a recession china s central bank has cut the amount of cash that commercial lenders need to set aside as reserves six times since the start of 2018 to spur lending and prop up its slowing economy beijing is also fast tracking infrastructure spending and rolling out tax cuts worth trillions of yuan to support businesses especially manufacturers hurt by the intensifying trade war the policy stimulus announced so far is sufficient to stabilise growth in 2019 20 despite the recent u s tariff hike lipton said following recent meetings with officials in china no additional policy easing is needed provided there are no further increases in tariffs or a significant slowdown in growth in march beijing set a 2019 economic growth target of between 6 and 6 5 growth cooled last year to 6 6 percent the slowest pace in nearly 30 years however risks to the chinese economy would rise sharply if trade conditions sour more quickly let me make it clear if tariffs do go up to say 25 across the board growth would be affected significantly said kenneth kang deputy director of imf asia who led the recent imf visits in this case we do see a case for temporary stimulus to support the economy especially if there is a risk to economic and financial instability he said any chinese stimulus to prop up growth should be contained kang added referring to concerns about rising debt and financial risks further monetary stimulus steps should be taken while focusing on domestic conditions such as inflation risks kang told reporters in beijing the imf expects the headline inflation rate to rise to 2 3 this year from 2 1 percent in 2018 reflecting higher food prices beijing has set a 2019 inflation target of around 3 the imf acknowledged china s past efforts to contain a rapid build up in debt but stressed it was important for beijing to push forward its financial regulatory reforms despite trade tensions the priority should be to fully implement the announced regulatory reforms and continue with structural regulatory reforms to reduce still elevated vulnerabilities lipton said bank capital especially for small and medium size banks should be strengthened and micro prudential regulations should not be relaxed even temporarily for cyclical reasons or to offset tighter domestic financial conditions source reuters reporting by yawen chen and ryan woo editing by shri navaratnam kim coghill
excerpts from recent editorials in the united states and abroad ___ june 5 china daily on the united states approach to chinese telecommunications equipment company huawei us secretary of state mike pompeo may think he has been doing a good job in throttling the growth of chinese telecommunications equipment company huawei because wherever he goes he has tried to sell the notion that the company poses a severe threat to national security and intelligence and dissuade the countries concerned from doing any business with it but he might have been overdoing it a little bit even to the extent that the well intentioned advice as he claims it is has sounded more like coercion that even his hosts find it hard to accept during his visit to the netherlands early this week pompeo told his hosts not to do anything that would endanger our shared security interests by embracing huawei prompting his dutch counterpart to retort that every country must make its own security decisions the us top diplomat had already harped on the same string in germany last week urging chancellor angela merkel s government to take actions against chinese espionage and warning the us might have to change its behaviour regarding intelligence sharing if berlin failed to do so the fact that pompeo has often received a cold shoulder when trying to smear huawei in this way shows his audiences know when they are being fed a line he seems to have forgotten that country to country relations are built on common interests not one dictating to another what the other can and cannot do that s why the united kingdom has so far resisted washington s call to shun huawei in its new 5g network despite the tremendous pressure it faces from the us because it knows firsthand that the chinese company does not threaten its national security as it has already been closely involved in its 4g network if he truly believes that huawei is bent on helping the chinese government spy on other governments even after it has proposed to sign no spy deals with possible partners and even after countries have put themselves on high alert in response to the us sounding constant alarm bells pompeo should at least consider changing tactic rather than keep on babbling about an imagined danger he should have confidence in the counterintelligence capabilities of the world s sole superpower and let other governments give huawei s equipment and system a try if huawei is spying the us should be able to catch it red handed that outcome if it materialized would save pompeo all the trouble of travelling around the world trying to convince a largely incredulous audience after all facts speak louder than words online ___ june 4 the virginian pilot on the victims of a mass shooting in virginia beach keith cox served the residents of virginia beach in the public utilities department for 12 years well liked by co workers he spent his final moments on friday working to protect them from a gunman in the municipal centre sacrificing his life in the process the remembrance of cox published in the pilot on monday is one of many heartbreaking stories to emerge from the darkness that still hangs over this community four days after the worst mass shooting in the city s history attention should be paid to the criminal investigation being conducted by local state and federal law enforcement agencies they are diving into the details of the shooter s life his movements prior to the attack and the possible motivation for this horrific act in the hope of gaining some insight into why and how this happened but for now our focus should be on those precious lives cut short on friday celebrating their memory and paying tribute to their selflessness they deserve no less from the community they served so let us remember cox the public utilities account clerk who was described as a jovial caring co worker and a talented singer in the choir at new hope baptist church where his father serves as pastor as the shooter roamed the building cox ushered several employees into an office telling them to lock the door while he looked for others to help rich nettleton spent 28 years working for the city as a utilities engineer a norfolk resident and old dominion university graduate he was a lieutenant for the army s 130th engineer brigade in germany where he served with beach city manager dave hansen joshua hardy spent more than four years as an engineering technician but loved ones remembered him as a devout christian whose love for children led him to author the abc book on protecting yourself from strangers a book he self published in 2011 missy langer worked as an administrative assistant in the public utilities department for 12 years neighbors recalled her as a passionate pittsburgh steelers fan she had a tough few years long both her parents in the last five years but was proud of the life she built in virginia beach kate nixon was an engineer with a decade of experience working for the city whose love of her husband and three children was plainly evident to all who knew her alex gusev came to this country from belarus in 2003 and was recalled by a colleague as a model professional who handled right of way issues for virginia beach he was also a graduate of odu who was quick to help friends and loved ones in need for most of her 24 years in virginia beach government mary lou gayle worked as a right of way agent who was recalled by neighbours for the upkeep and improvements made to her home which was described as gorgeous a parishioner at st john the apostle catholic church gayle was well thought of by all those in her orbit tara gallagher a graduate of portsmouth s woodrow wilson high school earned two engineering degrees from odu before joining the city six years ago laquita brown a chesapeake resident was a right of way agent for more than four years bert snelling was a contractor visiting building 2 for a permit when the shooting began another odu graduate chris rapp joined the city 11 months ago after serving as stafford county s public works director for two years he was recalled for his love of bagpipes which he played with tidewater pipes drums and his devotion to family and friends and bobby williams who joined the city in 1981 was repeatedly honoured for his lengthy public service throughout his career he was the type of employee who provides invaluable continuity and institutional memory to municipal government stories about each of the victims are available to read they have been told with respect grace and sensitivity honouring the memory of each life lost and the emotional toll on those left behind hold them all in your hearts online ___ june 4 the wall street journal on u s economic policies as the election results became clear in 2016 financial markets rose amid a surge of economic optimism that surge continued for two years as donald trump and republicans pursued a pro growth agenda of tax reform deregulation and encouraging domestic energy production but with democrats now controlling the house and mr trump already campaigning for re election washington is again taking an anti growth turn don t be surprised if slower growth follows that s the disappointing big picture if you step back from the daily fray and look at the direction of u s economic policy mr trump s first two years were focused relentlessly on ending the economic malaise of the obama years nearly every policy was seen through a growth prism but as he focuses on re election mr trump is returning to the issues that marked the worst moments of his 2016 campaign he is restrictionist on immigration increasingly protectionist on trade and more interventionist in regulating business he favours price controls on drugs a mandate for paid family leave and his regulators are revving up what looks like it could become the largest federal antitrust campaign since the 1970s meanwhile house and senate democrats are advancing their own election agenda that includes higher taxes and new regulation on finance and industry the only pro growth measure that could pass would be mr trump s renegotiated nafta deal but that is in greater jeopardy after last week s tariffs on mexico gridlock will probably prevail through 2020 but investors will have to start discounting the chance that democrats could implement much of their agenda in 2021 all of this is already hurting growth and especially business investment the institute for supply management s manufacturing index fell to 52 1 in may its lowest since 2016 surveys of cfos show that investment plans for 2019 have slowed sharply amid the new policy uncertainty a majority of business earnings calls mention trade as a major concern the residual good news is that the policy reforms of 2017 built considerable pro growth momentum that led to 3 1 growth in 2018 the labour market is still buoyant and wages are rising yet these are often lagging indicators and consumer confidence typically declines if markets and growth fall falling bond yields are signalling a growth slowdown and the yield curve is inverted in what nearly always predicts a recession if it continues for three months the atlanta federal reserve s gdp now estimate for second quarter growth is down to 1 3 and even some long time bulls are warning that we may be looking at a return to the slow growth of the obama years mr trump seems to believe the federal reserve can make everything great again by cutting interest rates and he may get the rate cuts he wants this year we opposed the fed s rate increase in december and that advice looks vindicated by declining inflation but the fed can t offset bad trade policy by itself u s tariffs have a negative impact on growth around the world which in turn hurts u s exports that s part of the explanation for the recent decline in u s manufacturing as slower growth abroad means declining demand for american goods we aren t predicting recession though you can t rule that out if mr trump follows through on his worst trade threats against china mexico and europe asterisk asterisk asterisk a conceit of nearly all politicians is that they can get away with bad economic policies without paying too high a price barack obama believed that his regulatory assaults on business had more benefits than costs his economic advisers told him that higher tax rates don t matter they should have learned otherwise after eight years of 2 growth and slow wage gains that laid the path for mr trump in 2016 now mr trump and his republican fellow travellers think they can impose tariffs willy nilly with little damage they say the doomsayers were wrong about the impact of the initial round of china tariffs and in any case the tariffs are popular with the public they say mr trump needs wedge issues against democrats in 2020 and he can run as a trade hawk on china against joe biden but mr trump campaigned in 2016 on reviving the economy and the surge of growth has helped to offset his personal unpopularity bad policies operate at the margin and their effect is cumulative the initial tariffs were dwarfed by the growth effects of tax reform and deregulation but the damage from tariffs will rise if they increase in severity and are imposed impulsively sooner or later bad policies always exact a high economic and political cost online ___ june 4 the plain dealer of cleveland ohio on the anniversary of d day on june 7 1944 readers of the plain dealer got a firsthand account of the allies pivotal d day landing the day before from the paper s war correspondent roelif loveland writing from a balcony seat high up in god s heaven as flak and tracer bullets lit up the sky around his aircraft and the cleveland family of 1st lt howard c quiggle was also able to read that he was alive and well and piloting the b 26 marauder that had ferried loveland to his eagle s perch above the battle riding the tail of a comet to see history in the making as loveland wrote in his page one story after that fateful day the d day landings that changed the course of war and accelerated adolf hitler s slow descent to defeat were launched 75 years ago this week we will accept nothing less than full victory came the order from supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force u s gen dwight d eisenhower yet victory was never certain a handwritten note from ike written in case of defeat concludes the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone fortunately bravery and devotion as well as luck planning daring and deep sacrifice by those who launched and fought on those bloody beaches did the trick attacking along 50 miles of shoreline more than 4 000 allied troops fell on that first day but many more followed beginning the drive for berlin where are they now those intrepid paratroopers bombardiers pilots medics army rangers and all those others who stormed ashore on june 6 1944 like 1st lt quiggle and roelif loveland a world war i combat veteran considered one of the greatest writers ever to grace the pages of the plain dealer most have passed on to their rewards only about 30 american survivors are expected to attend this year s d day battle anniversary in france nearly 350 world war ii veterans die every day the u s veterans affairs department estimates according to the associated press pretty soon they all will be gone and the rest of us must be the ones to carry forward their stories and remember the history they forged and their sacrifice and that of their fallen comrades longtime plain dealer military affairs reporter brian albrecht has helped by spending years compiling vivid stories from d day survivors and others who fought in or contributed to the war effort during world war ii twelve of those stories were highlighted in sunday s plain dealer from the 2008 remembrances of the late english clerk betty leighty of parma heights who came to the united states as a war bride in 1946 to john bistrica s vivid 1994 depiction of the tumultuous bloody landing at omaha beach and the night he spent freezing wet and hungry in a 20 foot hole he had to dig himself bistrica at 95 was recently profiled in the vindicator of youngstown where he lives their powerful stories need to be remembered along with the d day fight so crucial to ultimate victory in that war but are our collective memories fading too fast an associated press story in the plain dealer tuesday reported that many states no longer require d day to be part of the history curriculum the ohio department of education s 52 page model american history curriculum posted at education ohio gov does not mention d day that doesn t mean that teachers can t teach it and many probably do and educators might argue that as we get farther away in time from a conflict teaching its root causes and long term impacts becomes more important than the specifics of any given battle but specifics of battle also matter the nitty gritty reality of war matters so on this 75th anniversary of the d day battle we collectively should resolve to work harder to make sure this history this sacrifice this longest day isn t lost when the last veteran of that battle departs his earthly existence online ___ june 4 the los angeles times on the tiananmen square protests thirty years ago tuesday the world watched in horror as chinese troops cracked down brutally on peaceful protests by students who sought to give the chinese people more say over their daily lives the lingering image of the pro democracy movement though was from the next day when a lone unarmed man stopped a column of tanks in tiananmen square it was a symbol of courage defiance and the power of an individual sustained perhaps by the fact that he s never been identified and his fate is unknown to many in the west the crackdown was but a death rattle of an authoritarian system on the wrong side of history as the growing liberalized chinese economy spread prosperity across the country and as the internet opened a window into free world thought and culture they believed the pressure for democracy and self determination would become irresistible in the three decades since then the chinese economy has in fact grown spectacularly lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty and creating a strong middle class but the technology that helped chinese people to connect to one another in unprecedented ways also enabled orwellian surveillance and propaganda operations that have helped cement the chinese communist party s autocratic grip on power the chinese government has also used concerns about terrorism as a pretext to enact cynical security laws that give it even more power to spy on online traffic suppress dissent and block foreign nonprofits from assisting its critics meanwhile by allowing some public pushback on the digital margins tolerating small scale online agitation for consumer protection or improvements in public works the government pantomimes the accountability found in a democracy true change remains a mirage as a result china s pro democracy movement seems to be sustained mainly by activists who ve fled to safer shores it s telling that while we in the west can still see the tank man photos watch the video and read about the incident the chinese government is trying to erase them from its people s memory but then tanks are so 20th century today the fist of chinese oppression is best symbolized by the reeducation camps in xinjiang province roughly 2 000 miles west of tiananmen square where the chinese government has detained up to 2 million muslims in an effort to combat alleged separatism and religious extremism among the native uighurs not coincidentally the province is a key outpost in china s belt and road initiative that aims to increase china s exports to and its influence over south asia africa and europe we certainly hope that china s growing prosperity and integration into global commerce will prove inimical to its authoritarian impulses but the years since the tiananmen square protests have shown us that progress toward liberty and democracy is not inevitable in china the government sells stability as the guarantor of the economic growth that the public craves when its real aim is to keep the forces of change at bay online ___ june 4 the houston chronicle on storm recovery funds can you hear us now the trump administration s outrageous delays in making available more than 12 billion in storm recovery funds about 4 3 billion of the total is for texas have finally been dealt with the house on monday approved a senate bill that sets a 90 day countdown for the administration to formally invite states such as texas to submit spending plans for the money that will kick start the release of the funds that means flood recovery funds approved by congress just months after hurricane harvey hit in 2017 will get to texas in 2020 that s astoundingly tardy and yet even getting that much grease in the gears took quite literally an act of congress when texas land commissioner george p bush began raising hell with the administration over the delays early this year folks at housing and urban development which administers the funds and the office of management of budget which approves all new rules seemed anything but fazed at that time aides to both sen ted cruz and sen john cornyn told the editorial board that they had also been hammering at the administration to add a sense of urgency none of that got far instead what worked was individual members of congress decided to cross party lines and introduce legislation that would force the administration s hand cornyn teamed with sen joe manchin the west virginia democrat on a bill to require the disbursement of the funds a similar bill was authored in the house by a gaggle of members of congress including rep lizzie fletcher d houston neither bill passed but cornyn and others managed to include its basic provisions in a larger disaster funding bill that did now all that s required is president donald trump s signature which he s expected to give congratulations to cornyn manchin and the house members who made it so perhaps there s a lesson about dealing with the president talk is cheap but legislation can produce results as we await the presidential signature we note that many questions have been left unanswered why was the administration so slow hud officials told the editorial board earlier this year that because the funds were being spent in new ways on preventing future flood damage rather than repairing damage from previous floods new rules were needed congress was right to change the focus of these funds but hud should never have allowed the simple change to slow things down so profoundly others worried that the real reason for the delays flowed from the president s bitter reaction to puerto rico and the recovery it so badly needs in the wake of hurricane maria absent proof we ll pray that the latter feud played no role in the delays and either way the intricacies of team trump s machinations can be the subject for a debate another day the welcome news this week is that congress intervened in a way that should pay dividends for texas and fairly soon online ___ june 1 the new york times on recent deaths on mount everest because it s there for those who grew up on george mallory s famous explanation for his yearning to scale mount everest with all the romance danger and spirit of exploration it implied that viral photograph of an endless line of climbers in puffy parkas inching their way to the summit came as a profound shock danger there is at least 11 people died on the mountain this year as did mr mallory in 1924 the year after that interview with the times leaving forever open the question of whether he had first reached the summit all but two of those who died this climbing season perished on the way down overcome by altitude sickness and exhaustion after the hourslong delays created by the traffic jam in the oxygen starved atmosphere above 28 000 feet the other two fell as the snow and ice on the mountain succumb to climate change it is becoming common for climbers to come across the remains of those who died over the years but romance for mr mallory the need to reach the highest point on the planet was instinctive a part i suppose of man s desire to conquer the universe the conquest however has turned out to entail a landscape littered with tons of plastic bottles food tins excrement ropes and tents and scores of oxygen starved tourists lining up to take a selfie on the summit the fatalities this year were more than double last year s and the estimated 810 climbers to reach the 29 029 foot high 8 848 metres peak were the most ever as the climbing season came to an end the recriminations began many focused on the loose standards set by the government of nepal and the proliferation of dubious expedition companies china also runs expeditions from its side of the mountain but fewer use that route and the controls are said to be tighter on the nepal side anyone can pick up an everest permit for 11 000 and the total package with guides equipment food and lodging for a six week expedition can easily exceed 50 000 in one of the world s poorest countries that s a flow of money the government is loath to reduce nepalese officials are belatedly considering setting proficiency standards for climbers and limiting the numbers on the mountain to reduce congestion and garbage at the summit that should happen before the next climbing season begins but however disturbing the deaths and the queues everest still poses one of the greatest physical and mental challenges our planet has to offer and trying to deny it to people is as futile today as it was when

ohio on the anniversary of d day on june 7 1944 readers of the plain dealer got a firsthand account of the allies pivotal d day landing the day before from the paper s war correspondent roelif loveland writing from a balcony seat high up in god s heaven as flak and tracer bullets lit up the sky around his aircraft and the cleveland family of 1st lt howard c quiggle was also able to read that he was alive and well and piloting the b 26 marauder that had ferried loveland to his eagle s perch above the battle riding the tail of a comet to see history in the making as loveland wrote in his page one story after that fateful day the d day landings that changed the course of war and accelerated adolf hitler s slow descent to defeat were launched 75 years ago this week we will accept nothing less than full victory came the order from supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force u s gen dwight d eisenhower yet victory was never certain a handwritten note from ike written in case of defeat concludes the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone fortunately bravery and devotion as well as luck planning daring and deep sacrifice by those who launched and fought on those bloody beaches did the trick attacking along 50 miles of shoreline more than 4 000 allied troops fell on that first day but many more followed beginning the drive for berlin where are they now those intrepid paratroopers bombardiers pilots medics army rangers and all those others who stormed ashore on june 6 1944 like 1st lt quiggle and roelif loveland a world war i combat veteran considered one of the greatest writers ever to grace the pages of the plain dealer most have passed on to their rewards only about 30 american survivors are expected to attend this year s d day battle anniversary in france nearly 350 world war ii veterans die every day the u s veterans affairs department estimates according to the associated press pretty soon they all will be gone and the rest of us must be the ones to carry forward their stories and remember the history they forged and their sacrifice and that of their fallen comrades longtime plain dealer military affairs reporter brian albrecht has helped by spending years compiling vivid stories from d day survivors and others who fought in or contributed to the war effort during world war ii twelve of those stories were highlighted in sunday s plain dealer from the 2008 remembrances of the late english clerk betty leighty of parma heights who came to the united states as a war bride in 1946 to john bistrica s vivid 1994 depiction of the tumultuous bloody landing at omaha beach and the night he spent freezing wet and hungry in a 20 foot hole he had to dig himself bistrica at 95 was recently profiled in the vindicator of youngstown where he lives their powerful stories need to be remembered along with the d day fight so crucial to ultimate victory in that war but are our collective memories fading too fast an associated press story in the plain dealer tuesday reported that many states no longer require d day to be part of the history curriculum the ohio department of education s 52 page model american history curriculum posted at education ohio gov does not mention d day that doesn t mean that teachers can t teach it and many probably do and educators might argue that as we get farther away in time from a conflict teaching its root causes and long term impacts becomes more important than the specifics of any given battle but specifics of battle also matter the nitty gritty reality of war matters so on this 75th anniversary of the d day battle we collectively should resolve to work harder to make sure this history this sacrifice this longest day isn t lost when the last veteran of that battle departs his earthly existence online ___ june 4 the los angeles times on the tiananmen square protests thirty years ago tuesday the world watched in horror as chinese troops cracked down brutally on peaceful protests by students who sought to give the chinese people more say over their daily lives the lingering image of the pro democracy movement though was from the next day when a lone unarmed man stopped a column of tanks in tiananmen square it was a symbol of courage defiance and the power of an individual sustained perhaps by the fact that he s never been identified and his fate is unknown to many in the west the crackdown was but a death rattle of an authoritarian system on the wrong side of history as the growing liberalized chinese economy spread prosperity across the country and as the internet opened a window into free world thought and culture they believed the pressure for democracy and self determination would become irresistible in the three decades since then the chinese economy has in fact grown spectacularly lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty and creating a strong middle class but the technology that helped chinese people to connect to one another in unprecedented ways also enabled orwellian surveillance and propaganda operations that have helped cement the chinese communist party s autocratic grip on power the chinese government has also used concerns about terrorism as a pretext to enact cynical security laws that give it even more power to spy on online traffic suppress dissent and block foreign nonprofits from assisting its critics meanwhile by allowing some public pushback on the digital margins tolerating small scale online agitation for consumer protection or improvements in public works the government pantomimes the accountability found in a democracy true change remains a mirage as a result china s pro democracy movement seems to be sustained mainly by activists who ve fled to safer shores it s telling that while we in the west can still see the tank man photos watch the video and read about the incident the chinese government is trying to erase them from its people s memory but then tanks are so 20th century today the fist of chinese oppression is best symbolized by the reeducation camps in xinjiang province roughly 2 000 miles west of tiananmen square where the chinese government has detained up to 2 million muslims in an effort to combat alleged separatism and religious extremism among the native uighurs not coincidentally the province is a key outpost in china s belt and road initiative that aims to increase china s exports to and its influence over south asia africa and europe we certainly hope that china s growing prosperity and integration into global commerce will prove inimical to its authoritarian impulses but the years since the tiananmen square protests have shown us that progress toward liberty and democracy is not inevitable in china the government sells stability as the guarantor of the economic growth that the public craves when its real aim is to keep the forces of change at bay online ___ june 4 the houston chronicle on storm recovery funds can you hear us now the trump administration s outrageous delays in making available more than 12 billion in storm recovery funds about 4 3 billion of the total is for texas have finally been dealt with the house on monday approved a senate bill that sets a 90 day countdown for the administration to formally invite states such as texas to submit spending plans for the money that will kick start the release of the funds that means flood recovery funds approved by congress just months after hurricane harvey hit in 2017 will get to texas in 2020 that s astoundingly tardy and yet even getting that much grease in the gears took quite literally an act of congress when texas land commissioner george p bush began raising hell with the administration over the delays early this year folks at housing and urban development which administers the funds and the office of management of budget which approves all new rules seemed anything but fazed at that time aides to both sen ted cruz and sen john cornyn told the editorial board that they had also been hammering at the administration to add a sense of urgency none of that got far instead what worked was individual members of congress decided to cross party lines and introduce legislation that would force the administration s hand cornyn teamed with sen joe manchin the west virginia democrat on a bill to require the disbursement of the funds a similar bill was authored in the house by a gaggle of members of congress including rep lizzie fletcher d houston neither bill passed but cornyn and others managed to include its basic provisions in a larger disaster funding bill that did now all that s required is president donald trump s signature which he s expected to give congratulations to cornyn manchin and the house members who made it so perhaps there s a lesson about dealing with the president talk is cheap but legislation can produce results as we await the presidential signature we note that many questions have been left unanswered why was the administration so slow hud officials told the editorial board earlier this year that because the funds were being spent in new ways on preventing future flood damage rather than repairing damage from previous floods new rules were needed congress was right to change the focus of these funds but hud should never have allowed the simple change to slow things down so profoundly others worried that the real reason for the delays flowed from the president s bitter reaction to puerto rico and the recovery it so badly needs in the wake of hurricane maria absent proof we ll pray that the latter feud played no role in the delays and either way the intricacies of team trump s machinations can be the subject for a debate another day the welcome news this week is that congress intervened in a way that should pay dividends for texas and fairly soon online ___ june 1 the new york times on recent deaths on mount everest because it s there for those who grew up on george mallory s famous explanation for his yearning to scale mount everest with all the romance danger and spirit of exploration it implied that viral photograph of an endless line of climbers in puffy parkas inching their way to the summit came as a profound shock danger there is at least 11 people died on the mountain this year as did mr mallory in 1924 the year after that interview with the times leaving forever open the question of whether he had first reached the summit all but two of those who died this climbing season perished on the way down overcome by altitude sickness and exhaustion after the hourslong delays created by the traffic jam in the oxygen starved atmosphere above 28 000 feet the other two fell as the snow and ice on the mountain succumb to climate change it is becoming common for climbers to come across the remains of those who died over the years but romance for mr mallory the need to reach the highest point on the planet was instinctive a part i suppose of man s desire to conquer the universe the conquest however has turned out to entail a landscape littered with tons of plastic bottles food tins excrement ropes and tents and scores of oxygen starved tourists lining up to take a selfie on the summit the fatalities this year were more than double last year s and the estimated 810 climbers to reach the 29 029 foot high 8 848 meters peak were the most ever as the climbing season came to an end the recriminations began many focused on the loose standards set by the government of nepal and the proliferation of dubious expedition companies china also runs expeditions from its side of the mountain but fewer use that route and the controls are said to be tighter on the nepal side anyone can pick up an everest permit for 11 000 and the total package with guides equipment food and lodging for a six week expedition can easily exceed 50 000 in one of the world s poorest countries that s a flow of money the government is loath to reduce nepalese officials are belatedly considering setting proficiency standards for climbers and limiting the numbers on the mountain to reduce congestion and garbage at the summit that should happen before the next climbing season begins but however disturbing the deaths and the queues everest still poses one of the greatest physical and mental challenges our planet has to offer and trying to deny it to people is as futile today as it was when the times writer interviewing mr mallory concluded with this appeal be not beguiled o armchair explorer stick to the comparative security of your subway strap online
the world bank cut its 2019 global growth forecast citing a decline in investment levels across the world and a slowdown in trade growth to the weakest since the financial crisis 10 years ago global gross domestic product gdp growth is forecast at 2 6 per cent this year according to the washington based lender a reduction from its 2 9 per cent projection in january and down from a 3 per cent estimate made last year the global economy is expected to accelerate by 2 7 per cent next year and 2 8 per cent in 2021 according to the bank s annual global economic prospects report released on wednesday substantial challenges are clouding the global economic outlook in both the near and long term the world bank s president david malpass said in the report s foreword global growth has continued to weaken and momentum remains fragile downside risks to growth predominate including rising trade barriers a build up of government debt and deeper than expected slowdowns in several major economies global trade growth for this year has been revised down a full percentage point to 2 6 per cent slightly below the pace of the 2015 16 trade slowdown and the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis the bank s revisions follow similar moves by the international monetary fund and world trade organisation the re ignition of trade tensions between the us and china is a key reason for the downgrade the bank said president donald trump has threatened to impose tariffs on all mexican imports from next week unless the central american country halts flows of alleged illegal migrants to the us in may mr trump raised tariffs on some chinese products and threatened to impose duties on the majority of other imports from china however the world bank s forecasts for china and the us were broadly unchanged from earlier growth in the us the world s largest economy is projected to decelerate to 2 5 per cent slowing further to 1 7 per cent in 2020 and 1 6 per cent in 2021 as the fiscal stimulus expires china the world s second largest economy is set to expand 6 2 per cent this year slowing to 6 1 per cent in 2020 a 0 1 percentage point dip from the bank s earlier forecast for emerging market and developing economies sluggish investment levels are particularly concerning mr malpass said the bank expects investment in these economies to remain weak and below historical averages held back by slow global growth limited fiscal space and structural constraints that misallocate or discourage investment such as poor business environments labour and product market controls and weak governance government debt in emerging market and developing economies has surged by an average 15 percentage points of gdp since 2007 to 51 per cent of gdp in 2018 the current environment of low global interest rates and weak growth may appear to mitigate concerns about elevated debt levels the bank said however the cost of rolling over debt can increase sharply during periods of financial stress and result in financial crises the bank cautioned which may have further negative implications for investment and long term growth the bank downgraded its forecast for the eurozone the world s biggest economic bloc to 1 2 per cent in 2019 and 1 4 per cent in 2020 down 0 4 and 0 1 percentage points respectively from january s forecast the revision reflects weakness in trade and domestic demand the 19 country bloc grew 1 8 per cent last year economic conditions in the euro area have deteriorated rapidly since mid 2018 particularly in the manufacturing sector the report said the heightened possibility of a disorderly exit by the uk from the european union compounds economic risks overall heightened policy uncertainty and weaker than expected investment in advanced economies and many emerging market economies casts a shadow on global growth prospects for the coming year growth in the middle east and north africa is projected to remain subdued at 1 3 per cent in 2019 compared to a forecast 1 4 per cent in 2018 investment activity in oil exporting economies has slowed due to weak oil sector output and the effects of renewed us sanctions on iran the world bank said regional growth is projected to pick up to around 3 percent in 2020 21 supported by capital investment and policy reforms recent high frequency indicators suggest this period of weakness may be receding however global activity remains subdued the bank said
reports in western media on the huge amount of capital flowing out of china and the chinese government imposing restrictions over money outflows in recent years had cast a shadow on the hearts of investors but now they may feel relieved by a new set of statistics issued by the state administration of foreign exchange safe which shows the demand for and supply of foreign exchange was approaching equilibrium in the first quarter according to safe statistics banks settlements in foreign currencies increased by 7 percent year on year in u s dollar terms while foreign currency sales dropped by 12 percent the settlement to sales deficit stood at 40 9 billion down by 67 percent over the same period in 2016 international receipts through banks increased by 2 percent year on year while payments dropped by 9 percent with a deficit of 25 2 billionâ a decline of 78 percent compared with the same period in 2016 according to the data capital outflows clearly slowed down in the first quarter of the year since the second half of 2014 china has seen net capital outflows its foreign exchange reserves have also kept dropping the reasons why capital kept hemorrhaging out of china can mainly be attributed to expectations of interest rate hikes by the u s federal reserve china s rising outbound investments and the outside world s concerns regarding the chinese economy s development the people s bank of china pboc the country s central bank and safe interpreted the massive capital outflows as an opportunity to promote the opening up of china s financial market in the short term the authorities are seeking to reach a balance between foreign exchange receipts and payments and to prevent risks in cross border capital flows in the long run their goal is to push forward capital account convertibility in february 2016 the pboc announced that it would expand access to the chinese market for foreign institutional investors so that more such investors would be able to invest in china s inter bank bond markets since may 2016 these investors have been required to get registered without limitations on individual or overall quotas inward and outward remittances are required to be largely in the same currency all these moves are designed to reduce the impact of large scale inbound and outbound flows of capital on the balance of international payments by the end of december 2016 more than 180 foreign institutions or funds had got registered at the pboc shanghai head office reforms of foreign currency management targeting qualified foreign institutional investors and renminbi qualified foreign institutional investors were launched in february and august 2016 respectively which raised the investment quota for individual institutions simplified the approval process and reduced the lock up period from one year to three monthsâ which improved the flow of capital so far these measures have produced good results the drop in foreign exchange reserves in 2016 was 38 percent less compared with that in 2015 moreover in february and march this year china s foreign exchange reserves rebounded the data issued by the national bureau of statistics on april 17 have bolstered the market s confidence in the stabilization of the chinese economy in the first quarter the chinese economy grew by 6 9 percent over the same period last year 0 1 percentage point higher than the growth rate in the previous quarter a lot of economic indexes are improving for example the official manufacturing purchasing managers index grew for eight months to 51 8 percent in marchâ the highest since may 2012 externally although the u s federal reserve raised its benchmark rate in march the u s dollar index which measures the value of the dollar against other select currencies fluctuated only within a narrow range and dropped 1 8 percent in the first quarter with the smooth development of a market based exchange rate regime in china following the renminbi s inclusion in the international monetary fund s special drawing rights basket on october 1 2016 the flexibility of the currency s exchange rate will also increase which will help promote two way flows of capital the internal and external factors mentioned previously have bolstered investors confidence in the chinese market according to a report by the un conference on trade and development china ranked third on the list of economies receiving capital inflows in 2016 the first two on that list were the united states and the united kingdom china will push forward the opening up of its capital account in a prudent manner any further tightening of its foreign exchange management policies is impossible as wang chunying spokesperson of safe said on april 19 the window which was opened will not be shut this is a strong assurance of free and convenient transnational capital flows of course china will try to prevent risks in cross border capital flows as well as any negative impact on its financial stability it will safeguard the healthy development of its foreign exchange market with prudent supervision and market monitoring systems copyedited by bryan michael galvan
the emerging consensus about the u s china trade standoff is that both sides are settling in for the long haul as suggested in recent headlines from around the world using precisely that phrase it seems obvious though that the the long haul means very different things to the two sides in the u s the body politic and the media are already consumed by a presidential election that is still 18 months away they see chinese president xi jinping as a strongman with a lifetime appointment and control over the political military and financial levers of power in his country the conventional wisdom seems to be that president xi can wait out president trump while pressuring various elements of trump s electoral coalition including blue collar manufacturing workers and farmers in hopes that his bid for reelection will fail but in china the political establishment which includes state controlled media is creating an alternative reality for public consumption derived from what xi himself is saying it s always best when trying to assess china s intentions to listen carefully to its leaders they tend to speak with clear intent in xi s precise words about the trade standoff he is preparing china for what he calls a new long march he s not saying we re in this for the long haul or this will be a long term challenge while both may be true the words he has chosen instead are not accidental they connote something far more profound than a political cycle or two xi understands that china is edging along the precipice of a significant financial crisis if not worse and that beijing cannot stop it he is preparing the chinese public for this eventuality as a historic event the long march was a massive military retreat by the red army in the face of likely annihilation by the army of the chinese nationalist party it led to mao tse tung s consolidation of power within the communist party and some years later to the party s assumption of power mao declared the long march a propaganda force that allowed him to solidify the image of the red army and ultimately the communist party as the decisive actor in china one needn t be an expert in chinese history language or politics to assume that xi understands both the history and the present day propaganda potential of the long march very well he announced his new long march in jiangxi where the first one began in jiangxi he said that the chinese people must be conscious of the long term and complex nature of various unfavorable factors at home and abroad and properly prepare for the various difficult situations it is hard to reconcile a setback in trade negotiations as it is seen in the u s with president xi s choice of terminology and imagery he has raised the specter of one of the most formative experiences in the history of the prc and a world historic military setback at that combined with his references to complex unfavorable factors and various difficult situations his posture hints at concerns far deeper than whether he can reach a deal with the trump administration on the trade volume of soybeans and pork or even on intellectual property rights notwithstanding its appearance of strength and prosperity the chinese economy has all the characteristics of an unstable market that can ill afford a shock from any direction the pressure from the trade war is exposing cracks that have been there for anyone who wanted to see them well before now this was probably inevitable either way and xi and the political class know it the most significant pending shock is the likelihood that china is on the cusp of being a net importer of goods and services for the first time in a generation a variety of factors are combining to create a current account deficit for china as the economist noted in a recent article that china sells more to the world than it buys from it can seem like an immutable feature of the economic landscape it may not be much longer the implications of this shift are profound it threatens one of china s most powerful perceived assets 3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves including 1 trillion in u s treasury bonds and the image it has lent the country as a net creditor to the world this is about to change if it does those reserves will go fast it is certain the chinese leaders understand as much even if it seems not to be too important to american trade negotiators focused on the surplus china has with the united states together with the unstable underlying economic conditions of the country sustained overall trade deficits and the ensuing challenges would justify xi s call for a strategic retreat however difficult it will be there already is a lot of pressure on china s reserves total debt in the country is approaching three times gdp a figure that s triple the debt to gdp ratio of the u s the government needs to bolster the banking system and keep liquidity in the economy the reserves are also needed for currency protection should beijing make any meaningful attempts at it the renminbi has drifted down 8 percent in the last year and is approaching 7 rmb dollar a level not seen since the financial crisis but if china experiences a sustained current account deficit and becomes a net importer and therefore a net borrower in the world those reserves will be needed even more after preserving the banking system protecting the currency and financing trade xi will find that he doesn t have much of that 3 trillion left the trends are not favorable even at their current level the foreign reserves of the country are down from nearly half of gdp in 2010 to about a quarter of gdp today sustained trade deficits will accelerate that decline and further deployment of the reserves that remain will have one off effects that will create additional challenges dumping u s treasuries which constitute a significant portion of those reserves would spur higher u s interest rates and possibly a slowdown in american economic growth which would impact china too encouraging even more capital flight from the country when china was running large current account surpluses and building reserves it was afforded a certain freedom of movement and independence the country weathered the financial crisis a decade ago with the help of government stimulated liquidity trade surpluses bolstered by a high savings rate large foreign exchange reserves and a government controlled banking system can cover a lot of ills but if the trade balance flips the other way it will be difficult for china to avoid the discipline imposed by global free market forces beijing will have less control that s one of the realities of engaging in global trade indeed america s having run current account deficits for many years is one of the primary reasons for president trump s long held belief that trade is bad trade isn t bad or good but large shifts over time in a country s position within the global trading system can have profound implications as beijing seems to be finding out now of course the u s is fortunate to control the world s reserve currency the dollar without a fully convertible currency china is in just about the exact opposite position being a net borrower that runs trade deficits will put tremendous pressure on its savings and reserves president xi knows this is all unfolding against a challenging backdrop the economy is groaning under the weight of government corporate and household debt as it is in most underdeveloped economies excessive debt in china is a government policy driven by the use of easy money to stimulate economic growth demographic challenges loom from decades of disastrous social and family planning policies the number of retirees for every worker will more than double in the next decade and a half china s trade surpluses were driven by a high savings rate relative to individual consumption as the elderly draw down those savings they will put downward pressure on the current account for beijing there is added concern about the inevitable consequences of the growth in household debt among the urban elite in beijing shanghai guangzhou and other large cities the easy money is driving mortgage and credit card debt and creating real estate bubbles empty shopping malls and condominium developments in overbuilt ghost cities are just one sign of the looming debt crisis beneath all of this is persistent rural poverty to be sure the prc has lifted hundreds of millions of chinese from the levels of destitution that existed prior to the economic liberalizations under deng xiaoping and his successors xi has declared that the prc intends to eliminate poverty by 2020 and based on the prcs own poverty level of about 330 year in 2010 constant dollars he may be able to keep that promise but the world bank estimates that there are nearly 400 million chinese who subsist on less than 5 50 a day and therefore live below an internationally recognized poverty line that brings us to chinese economic growth which was 6 6 percent for fiscal year 2018 its lowest yearly level since 1990 it came in at 6 4 percent in the first quarter of this year remaining flat from the previous quarter and even that was better than some analysts expected helped by additional government stimulus in the form of extra bank lending to offset the impact of the trade pressures for years outside analysts have insisted that beijing s best and brightest could manipulate the controls and keep the economy cruising along indeed after the 2008 financial crisis the worst effects of that period were avoided through such manipulation but the effects of the decisions made then have taken their toll over time since 2010 total debt has doubled economic growth has declined by four percentage points or 40 percent and foreign exchange reserves relative to gdp have been cut nearly in half there is no more slack in the levers the government relied on in the past beijing is not in control of its own economic future and flipping from a sustained current account surplus to a deficit will accelerate other negative trends much like the red army in 1935 the chinese economy is surrounded by forces it cannot defeat and further action in any direction economic stimulus currency depreciation or foreign exchange release will only exacerbate its underlying problems it s not clear if xi s new long march strategic retreat is feasible but the rationale that underpins it is understandable the country s underlying weaknesses pre date xi s ascendancy and were acknowledged by his predecessors again when it comes to insightful analysis of china s situation you can t do much better than listening to its leaders themselves one recent leader described china s economy as unbalanced unstable uncoordinated and unsustainable this was then premier wen jiabao in 2007 before the great recession before xi and donald trump and barack obama for that matter and before the trade war wen was right then and xi is right today there is no way out of china s current predicament other than something as audacious as a strategic retreat that allows it to live to fight another day while weathering the coming financial crisis which it cannot avoid the new long march could take many forms in the most immediate sense we should expect more resistance to trade liberalization in the form of new import restrictions and capital controls import substitution is the classic default from global trade for emerging economies hence xi s call for the public to prepare for the various difficult situations ahead we may also see xi attempt some diversions he could trigger a cross strait confrontation with taiwan for instance or attempt more adventurism in disputed territories in the south china sea there might be grandiose new infrastructure projects inside china and abroad we should expect even more intense repression of ethnic minorities including the muslim uighur encirclement and even more unsettling use of technology to further control the population across the country and monitor foreigners within it and we should expect less cooperation than we ve seen of late on multilateral challenges including iran and north korea how should we respond the u s japan and other allies would be best served by an enlightened unity in defense of their mutual interests assuming that the trump administration is interested in executing such a policy the administration should attempt to use the pending crisis to encourage beijing to further modernize its financial system instituting banking transparency measures fully convertible currency and other reforms that will both ease china s ability to confront its new reality and connect it better with the world such efforts are worth trying even if they prove futile whatever policy response ensues our confrontation with china goes well beyond trade and tariffs above all it s imperative that the trump administration see china s new long march for what it is a strategic economic retreat accompanied by possible regional chauvinism and propaganda meant to placate the domestic audience and plan accordingly more from national review
beijing the international monetary fund imf cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for china to 6 2 per cent on wednesday on increased uncertainty around trade frictions saying more policy easing would be warranted if the sino us trade war escalates the downgrade came just two months after the imf raised its china forecast to 6 3 per cent from 6 2 per cent partly on then brightening prospects for a trade deal it also cut the growth forecast for 2020 to 6 per cent from 6 1 per cent a sudden escalation in the trade dispute last month underlined the risks for the world s second biggest economy from higher us tariffs on billions of dollars of chinese goods washington has levied higher tariffs on a total of us 250 billion of chinese imports since mid 2018 accusing china of forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft china which denies the accusations has retaliated with tariffs on about us 110 billion of us goods growth is expected to moderate to 6 2 per cent and 6 per cent in 2019 and 2020 respectively imf deputy managing director david lipton said in a statement the near term outlook remains particularly uncertain given the potential for further escalation of trade tensions us president donald trump has threatened to slap tariffs of up to 25 per cent on an additional list of chinese imports worth about us 300 billion the trade war has already upended global supply chains and hurt world growth economists say the tariffs will curb growth in the united states and china and financial markets worry a protracted dispute could tip the world economy into a recession china s central bank has cut the amount of cash that commercial lenders need to set aside as reserves six times since the start of 2018 to spur lending and prop up its slowing economy beijing is also fast tracking infrastructure spending and rolling out tax cuts worth trillions of yuan to support businesses especially manufacturers hurt by the intensifying trade war the policy stimulus announced so far is sufficient to stabilise growth in 2019 20 despite the recent us tariff hike mr lipton said following recent meetings with officials in china no additional policy easing is needed provided there are no further increases in tariffs or a significant slowdown in growth in march beijing set a 2019 economic growth target of between 6 per cent and 6 5 per cent growth cooled last year to 6 6 per cent the slowest pace in nearly 30 years however risks to the chinese economy would rise sharply if trade conditions sour more quickly let me make it clear if tariffs do go up to say 25 per cent across the board growth would be affected significantly said kenneth kang deputy director of imf asia who led the recent imf visits in this case we do see a case for temporary stimulus to support the economy especially if there is a risk of economic and financial instability he said any chinese stimulus to prop up growth should be contained mr kang added referring to concerns about rising debt and financial risks further monetary stimulus steps should be taken while focusing on domestic conditions such as inflation risks he told reporters in beijing the imf expects the headline inflation rate to rise to 2 3 per cent this year from 2 1 per cent in 2018 reflecting higher food prices beijing has set a 2019 inflation target of around 3 per cent the imf acknowledged china s past efforts to contain a rapid build up in debt but stressed it was important for beijing to push forward its financial regulatory reforms despite trade tensions the priority should be to fully implement the announced regulatory reforms and continue with structural regulatory reforms to reduce still elevated vulnerabilities mr lipton said reuters

customer experience as a result we have enhanced our competitive advantage and transformed our business american eagle has solidified its leadership with a winning signature jeans collection and customer first brand platform with aerie we build one of the most relevant new brands and fast growth concepts in the market today which is fueled by the deep emotional connection our customers have with that brand we ve accomplished a lot in the past several years but we are not slowing down today we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the disruption across the industry in addition

retail environment american eagle is stronger than ever with significant opportunity ahead the ae and me brand platform is helping us build a real relationship with our customers positioning ae as the leading voice for this generation our spring campaign pushed the brand platform further by showcasing the cast as they wanted to be seen the first time a brand has given talent the power to compose their own styling and images we have seen rising brand perception and increase in brand relevance positive customer retention rates and increased spending we recently introduced the ae and me council consisting of nine real american eagle customers serving as advisors across our brand our council members are leaders and change makers in their generation these amazing young women and men have inspired us to think differently about how we speak to our customers they ve helped us more effectively merchandise our assortment they ve influenced the causes we support and social content we ve created with them is positively shaping the perception and purchase consideration of ae both among existing and potential customers we look forward to their ongoing influence and contributions i m very pleased with the start of 2019 and i m very optimistic about the balance of the year to the team thanks for the great work and the amazing talent and effort you bring every day now i ll turn it over to jen jennifer foyle aerie global brand president thanks chad and good morning everyone i m extremely pleased to report another record quarter for aerie revenues rose 20 and we posted a 14 comparable sales increase in the first quarter the 14 comp built on a 38 increase last year that s a two year stack of 52 this also marked our 18th consecutive quarter of double digit sales growth it s really exciting to see the consistency of aerie s growth as we continue to capture meaningful market share we saw positive traffic and improved conversion rates in the stand alone stores the health of our business is based on successfully expanding our brand and growing aerie s customer base which increased this quarter also we saw the customer retention rates that were strong to last year in fact there was an 8 increase all areas of the business performed well we posted record sales volume in a number of categories in the first quarter including bras undies apparel and swim performance was led by continued newness especially in apparel we have invested in key categories as we look to fuel brand growth our customer love aerie s emphasis on cozy casual comfortable and active two additional strategic growth areas for aerie have been swim and bralettes which once again delivered in this quarter despite unseasonal weather we saw positive sales in swim driven by an amazing in store and fitting room experience and several years ago we led the industry with the launch of the bralette which put aerie on the map as a true innovator and a product leader this also continues to be an exciting area of growth in addition to creating collections that emotionally connect with our brand and a range of customers brand building efforts are a top priority for us we continue to see very positive results on social media we ve had significant growth in followers especially on instagram where our love the swim you re in campaign generated strong posts support from our inspirational aerie real role models influencers and aerie followers are continuing to expand our reach customer engagement in the quarter was also driven by grass root efforts this spring our camp aerie pop up tour brought the brand to new customers across eight college campuses and to fuel the aeriereal community this spring we introduced a new content platform aeriereal life it s a great place for customers and brand loyal to share thoughts and ideas about the future of aeriereal community and can strengthen the connection up to our customers in this first quarter business was positive across all channels as well with both digital and stores posting record sales all store formats performed positively with double digit comps in both stand alone and side by side locations and we are thrilled with the results in our new market store design over the past year we remodeled 15 stores into the new design and we are seeing comps nicely exceed the chain average our new store performance has also been stronger than ever and we are excited to open a total of 60 to 75 locations this year as we look forward we are committed to driving double digit growth for aerie as we move into new markets expand existing markets and rapidly grow our customer base thanks to the amazing aerie team again for all your great work and i look forward to another outstanding year and now i hand the call over to bob robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jen and good morning everyone we re pleased with our first quarter results particularly the top line performance which exceeded our expectations american eagle comps were up 4 in the first quarter and aerie comps increased 14 we saw positive comps across all channels for both brands as many other retailers have indicated the quarter started slow with a cold start to spring this led to increased promotional activity putting a bit of pressure on our gross margin however gross profit dollars improved we gained market share exceeded our guidance and reported earnings growth over a strong period last year my comments will focus on the adjusted first quarter results which exclude certain items as detailed in the press release and tables in the investor presentation total revenue increased 63 million for the first quarter rising 8 to a record 886 million comparable sales increased 6 building on 9 growth last year despite the slow start we saw a pickup in sales as we entered the spring break and easter holiday importantly both our core brands continued to capture market share i m pleased to note that brick and mortar stores for both brands posted positive comp sales during the period marking the sixth consecutive quarter of growth on a consolidated basis stores increased in the low single digits with positive comps across all geographic regions in the us digital sales rose in the low double digits reaching 30 of total revenue up 100 basis points from 29 last year we saw the biggest increases coming from our app and mobile channels which combined now represent more than half of our digital business gross profit increased 21 million or 7 to 325 million from 304 million last year the gross margin rate contracted 30 basis points to 36 7 of revenue this reduction in rate reflects a higher markdown rate and increases in digital delivery expense and compensation costs which were partially offset by rent leverage and lower product costs selling general and administrative expense of 231 million increased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenues to 26 store compensation was the largest contributor to the increase this was mainly due to the continued impact of our investments in customer facing store payroll and wages which began in mid 2018 we invested in incremental marketing this quarter to support aerie s sponsorship of captain marvel to support greater brand awareness increase professional fees also contributed to the 20 million increase from 210 million last year depreciation and amortization increased 3 million to 45 million yet was flat as a rate to revenue at 5 1 compared to last year adjusted operating income declined 6 to 49 million from 52 million last year our operating margin declined 80 basis points to 5 6 as a rate of revenue the effective tax rate was 22 compared to 22 1 last year adjusted eps of 0 24 increased 4 from 0 23 last year and came in ahead of our guidance adjusted earnings in the first quarter excluded restructuring charges of 1 5 million or approximately 0 01 per share now regarding inventory which can be found on page 9 of the investor presentation we ended the quarter with inventory at cost of 456 million up 13 from last year with units up 10 versus the year ago period this increase reflects strong demand and expanded collections for american eagle jeans and new store growth for aerie in addition we ended the quarter with 12 clearance stores up from five last year which also contributed to the increase in ending inventory capital expenditures totaled 37 million in the first quarter and we continue to expect capex to be in the range of 200 million to 215 million for the year the planned increase in capital spending is primarily driven by increased aerie store openings during the quarter we also completed 20 million in share repurchases and paid 24 million in dividends to shareholders as a result of our strong free cash flow generation we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of 350 million up 40 million or 13 to last year looking at our real estate portfolio our 2019 priorities are to accelerate the growth of aerie with approximately 60 to 75 store openings to reposition and remodel ae stores and continue expanding our global footprint additional store information could be found on pages 12 through 16 in the investor presentation regarding tariffs those announced to date are immaterial however if tariffs are expanded to apparel there would be an adverse effect on our financial results with that said we are actively collaborating with our sourcing partners and believe we can significantly mitigate any potential impact from additional tariffs we are also working to further diversify our production capabilities across geographies now looking ahead we expect second quarter earnings per share in the range of 0 30 to 0 32 which assumes comparable sales growth in the positive low single digits our second quarter guidance compares to eps of 0 34 last year and excludes potential impairment and restructuring charges in summary we are very pleased with our performance to start the year and are confident in our outlook for the remainder of the year we are in a market leading position continue to capture market share and are taking advantage of a disrupted marketplace as the team discussed we are focused on our strategic initiatives which will continue to generate financial returns to our shareholders thanks and now we d like to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of kate fitzsimons with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question kate fitzsimons rbc capital markets analyst yes hi good morning guys congratulations on the strong top line bob i was hoping you could help us think a little bit more about the second quarter guidance just what are you expecting in terms of margin complexion between gross margin and sg a and particularly on the gross margin side if you could just help us think about the inputs between markdowns delivery rent etc that would be helpful thank you robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thank you kate appreciate the questions so you can really expect gross margin particularly on the merch margin line to experience very similar pressure to what we experienced in q1 we actually leveraged bow expenses in the quarter based on the fact that we delivered a mid single digit comp with the low single digit comp guidance we re actually expecting to deleverage bow expenses so you ll see a little more pressure on the gross margin overall than what we saw in q1 related to sg a expense guidance for the quarter we ve been pretty consistent reiterating the fact that we re going to continue to invest in things like store payroll and advertising that investment incremental investments started at the end of q2 last year so we continued to incrementally invest in q1 our sg a expense was up 21 million or 10 that is sequentially going to start to decrease and you should expect sg a expense increase to be less than what we saw in q1 and that the percentage increase would be roughly half of what we saw in the first quarter kate fitzsimons rbc capital markets analyst so but it sounds like we should still expect sg a deleverage in 2q is that fair robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer you should expect sg a deleverage in q2 but at a much lower deleveraging rate than we saw in q1 kate fitzsimons rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks for the clarification operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from line of paul lejuez with a citi please proceed with your question paul lejuez citi analyst hey thanks guys wondering if you could talk about the performance of your new aerie stores relative to expectations for both the stand alone and side by side and i m also curious if you could speak to the performance of your ae stores that are side by side to an aerie also those that are in a mall where there is an aerie stand alone if you could talk about the ae stores versus the rest of the chains that are in malls without any aerie thanks jennifer foyle aerie global brand president i mean the comps that i just mentioned are basically across all of the various formats so i m really pleased with the 14 comp just to reiterate in this environment today what we re seeing out there are highly promotional environment and all of our formats held strong so that said what we re most pleased with is what we re seeing in some of our traditional malls our older stores that we renovated there were about 15 this quarter they are seeing well above average above the average comps so we re focusing on not only opening up new stores but refurbishing our old and we re constantly looking at our assortments in these various formats to optimize our product offerings and we see still opportunity there we can focus in some of our smaller stores and give them even more depth in their key items to even grow their businesses at the same rate but they are like i said but just as we look ahead we think we can even do more in some of these smaller formats and we re really excited about what we delivered in q1 chad kessler american eagle global brand president and i think for ae it does help our women s business when we have aerie in the same mall whether it s a side by side or a stand alone i think anytime you have a strong brand that brings traffic to the mall it s good for us so we like a healthy retail environment bringing in traffic and aerie brings in traffic to the mall so it s great paul lejuez citi analyst thanks guys good luck operator thank you our next question comes from line of adrienne yih with wolfe research please proceed with your question adrienne yih tennant wolfe research analyst good morning congratulations to everybody what a great result it was really tough quarter you re welcome chad my first question is for you can you discuss the promotional backdrop it seems like when you do have a little to give a little bit of merch margin you get it back and stays in market share so is there any indication that that aur is reaching a low point for jen i mean another stunning result so can you talk about as pink ph continue to dominate market share how much faster would you be willing to accelerate your store expansion and then bob really quickly tariff exposure and sourcing to china and mexico thank you so much chad kessler american eagle global brand president thanks adrienne so for ae i think it has been a very promotional environment and i think that we continued to drive especially sort of 11 months of the year in the first three quarters continued to outperform the sector being a full priced as we can and really relying on the strength of our jeans business and the strength of the brand to drive traffic and then the store investments to drive conversion i don t see we expect our plans going forward or to be not to be to not be any more promotional than we ve been last year i think that you know we find that when we get more promotional that it s actually harder to drive some of the sales expansion so our goal is to continue to lean in on our store experience our brand and our product strength and win that way jennifer foyle aerie global brand president great adrienne just to clarify on your question just what are you asking what contributes to our increased market share if that was the question really it s all of our categories and the continued focus on customer acquisition and retention and as we expand into new markets my team has an incredible strategy the marketing teams really blown it out on when we enter a new market how do we engage a new customer and get her into our brand so that s a high that s really a major focus of what we are up to today and then we re opening up stores as fast as we can we re talking about 70 this year i think if i did anymore my team might heel over adrienne they re working as hard as we can to get into new markets as fast as we can markets that we need to expand in currently and then we re really getting into texas and california this year which we re really excited about robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer one thing that actually drives the pace at which we open aerie stores also is just the supply of desirable locations we re really looking for 40 50 yard line locations in a mall not looking to sacrifice getting into a location in a less than optimal positioning in the mall so we re being patient and prudent in that growth related to jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer but to also add bob is developers want our concept robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer we re like the retailer of choice robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer that s exactly right so they re actually opening up space for us in that regard jay thank you related to tariffs china mexico mexico is a non event for us essentially the biggest issue i have with mexico tariffs is that i think the price of avocados is going to go up and that s one of my favorite fruits related to china we ve got very strong relationships with our manufacturers we are the customer of choice just based on the amount of business that we do with them and the relationships that we have we ve been working through the china tariff possibility for quite a while with them and we feel very confident that we will be able to significantly or substantially mitigate any potential impact of china tariff should they go through in addition to the fact that we re constantly looking to diversify the geographies that we do produce our inventory and we will continue that exercise so everybody is waiting with bated breath to see what happens with this china trade war but i think we are in a great position to mitigate it significantly should it occur operator thank you our next question comes from line of tiffany kanaga with deutsche bank please proceed with your question tiffany kanaga deutsche bank research analyst hi thanks for taking our questions given such a strong first quarter performance across brands can you walk us through your thought process behind second quarter comp guidance that does imply a meaningful deceleration and how quarter to date trends have factored into your planning and how they re running today robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah our second quarter comp guidance takes into consideration not only current business but anticipated business and we feel as though you know may got off to a slightly slow start it was somewhat unseasonably cool continuation from q1 but we feel very confident in our ability to drive the remainder of the business through the rest of the quarter and we feel very confident with the comp guidance that we gave jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer but you know bob to add to that question that despite all that we still comped on a positive comp and we didn t have the best conditions out there if we had better weather and better feeling out there with the consumer everything would explode and that even despite what s going on out there we re still comping robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer we re not only comping jay but our two year stack is very strong and it s not a big deceleration at all based on low single digit guidance in the quarter so strong two year stack performance and we re in a position of strength as a business and a brand we will continue to kind of finish with our incremental investments within q2 and we will see you will see that within the second half of the year that we will be leveraging gross margin and sg a expense as we ve communicated for a while now jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah also to point out when we look at our business we build for the future we re not building you know we perform quarter to quarter but if we were to invest in something in marketing because we believe it s going to give us future we re going to invest for the future we re not looking shortsighted we re looking what s best for the brand and how to drive business for the future robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer alright then sticking with our growth pillars and our strategies we re operating from a position of strength and jay i love this disruption i ll take it all day long because we continue to grab more and more market share every day every day you re hearing something about a different retailer struggling going bankrupt having huge restructuring charges store closings we re not in that position at all jay we re sitting on 350 million of cash and 400 million abl is undrawn jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer and even better than that bob and i ve chad and jen here the product we make today is the best product that we ve ever made and we re very proud of that when it comes back to school for our denim program we will have the most outstanding denim out there we ll have the best of laser finished denim the best sustainability and we re very excited about it the stuff we re going to be offering in the next few months is the greatest stuff i ve ever seen in this company robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer agreed we re excited jay judy meehan vice president of investor relation melissa we ll take the next question operator thank you our next question comes from line of janet kloppenburg with jjk research please proceed with your question janet kloppenburg jjk research analyst hi everyone and congratulations on a great quarter a question for jay first is if you could talk to us about your capital allocation priorities and perhaps talk about any m a opportunities you see and for bob if you could just confirm the outlook for sg a leverage in fiscal 19 which i think was included in your original fiscal 19 guidance at the end of fourth quarter thank you jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer well you know janet i think bob emphasized that our company has no debt we have a very good cash situation we re producing a lot of free cash flow if the right opportunities are out there we will take a look at those right opportunities but we can t express what they are because until something is done but we believe like bob said this is a disruptive time it s if it was normal times time with what s going on out there will be disruptive but every day there s something new going on out there and the political environment out there is definitely keeping us on our toes and we believe that there s going to be opportunities for down the road and we ll be in position to take advantage of it at the same time we are making investments in our brands and our marketing because we say with american eagle and we re hearing too that it s not just the opportunity in the united states it s a world market out there too and we re expanding our brand more and more places we see it s amazing how the brand is received in many different parts of the world and we see big opportunity there too and we see a lot of growth and we see a lot of businesses like to add on whether it d be in the beauty business area or whether it d be in accessories we do have that opportunity within our company to do that so we re very excited we have a great infrastructure built we can handle all types of merchandise and like bob said it is disruptive out there but when you have disruption you have real opportunity one thing we are very proud of that i said earlier we have a great team and it s an experienced team it s a team that s worked well together so it s not a new team it s a team that we have been working well together for last several years together we all have confidence each other we all watch each other s back and we are inaudible which is very important robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer and just to reiterate on that jay the strength of our balance sheet gives us a lot of opportunity and is really part of what is widening our competitive mode janet to your point on sg a leverage for fiscal year we are expecting to leverage sg a for the full year it s kind of the tale of two halves as i pointed out first half continuing our strategic investments in payroll and advertising we will be lapping that in the second half and we will be driving sg a leverage in the second half so for the full year you can expect slight sg a leverage for the full year operator thank you our next question comes from the line of susan anderson with b riley fbr please proceed with your question carlin lynch b riley fbr analyst hi guys this is carlin lynch on for susan anderson thanks for taking my question congrats on a good quarter just wanted to get a bit of an update on international in particular with some of the china restructuring and then also for in europe i know last quarter you had said that you weren t operating there yet if we could get just get any timeline about when you kind of expect that to start to make an impact that would be great thanks robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so actually in the first quarter we completed the exit or closure of our remaining stores in the china market we only had four stores scattered across the market and we completed that at the end of the quarter we re currently in the process of looking for new franchisees licensing partners or joint venture partners in the region we re well along our way on that but have not come to a final decision at this point the china market asia in particular in the aggregate still represents a huge opportunity for us in something that s a high priority for the organization as it relates to europe as we previously stated we have new licensing partners in that region and actually we have two stores slated to open in the latter part of the fiscal year in europe so we re excited about that and starting to reenter that market which we exited a couple of years ago carlin lynch b riley fbr analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of laura champine with loop capital markets please proceed with your question laura champine loop capital markets analyst thanks for taking the question i understand that the environment was tough in q1 and your comp was great but with merchandise margin down with that as a backdrop how do you get confidence that the gross margin will inflect as you move through the year i presume that includes an expectation for a reversal in merch margin robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer it does and thank you for the question laura really the margin pressure that we saw in q1 that continues into q2 based on the guidance that we ve given is really a result of the unseasonably cool weather and the fact that our seasonal product hadn t sold through quite as much as we had hoped in the beginning of the season we are very committed jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer bob you should point out that the weather has been normal inaudible very well robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer no you re right jay so when the weather has kicked up become more normal a little warmer than it s been we ve seen huge comp pickups it s really about shorts as a category right and we were backing up a little bit in q1 and we re committed to make sure we exit q2 with clean inventory or an inventory currency that s got us position to have a strong back to school holiday season so that s really where you re seeing some of the gross margin pressure in q1 and q2 that will stop in q in the second half of the year when we enter the new back to school and holiday season and we re so dominant in bottoms long leg bottoms whether it s jeans or other bottoms that s where we are really getting the confidence that we ll be able to deliver gross margin rate improvement in the second half it falls right in with the seasonal cadence and it s really our sweet spot and where we re continuing to drive significant market share gains laura champine loop capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of marni shapiro with the retail tracker please proceed with your question marni shapiro the retail tracker analyst hey guys congratulations on a great quarter stores have looked really fantastic chad if you wouldn t mind can you give us an update on style drop and on your collaboration or partnership investment i guess with dormify and then jay if you could just follow up on that and sort of dovetailing on what jen had said these have been rentals and then an investment in dormify are two things that feel very right for your consumer have you how are you thinking about american eagle sort of a platform for investments to reach other angles for your consumer chad kessler american eagle global brand president sure so style drop we launched it this spring season in partnership with castle ph with clothing rental and it s been really exciting so far to see the customer interest it is at the test and we re not disclosing the metrics at this point but i can say that the customer interest has far exceeded our expectations but it s sort of two steps where you got to get the customer interested and then get them actually paying and part of that and we re closely on track with that but there s been a lot of excitement around that and i think it s great to participate in a new type of interacting selling engaging with the customers marni shapiro the retail tracker analyst is it a different customer or the same or a similar customer chad kessler american eagle global brand president we re seeing both we re seeing a mix of existing customers and bringing customers in so that will be part of what we analyze as we look at the test because we want this to be either way of getting expanded increased market share from existing customers or bring new customers into the brand and into jean so we need to look at how all of that plays together as we lead the test throughout the year the dormify investment is great that team the women around that brand are really passionate and talented and we re excited to continue to also partner with them to supply a significant portion of our dorm and apartment that we sell on our website i think there is definitely an opportunity for that to expand share of wallet and expand our relationship with our customer into new categories so that s been great and then making the investment and being able to both support them but also be inspired by what they re doing has been really great jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer you know and the question that you asked me is it basically comes down to by having an active omnichannel which we do i have the ability to sell through our stores or to sell like online it gives us it gives us greater flexibility looking at different opportunities such as dormify because we have the ability that when it comes back to school to offer our customers going back to school a whole package not just for the wear but also fixing up their fixing up their dorm rooms too marni shapiro the retail tracker analyst all right thank you guys best of luck for summer jennifer foyle aerie global brand president yeah thank you jay l schottenstein executive chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from line of dana telsey with telsey advisory group please proceed with your question dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good morning and nice to see the results as you think about the back to school season what would be the biggest differences this year as compared to last year and then following up on the question with collaboration i mean i was there when urban necessities got launched in the american eagle and soho and it s a total buzz and brings in a new customer in addition to the existing customers are more of those planned and what did you see from that and learnings either in categories or collaborations thank you chad kessler american eagle global brand president yeah i think i think the biggest difference for this back to school will be as jay said we ve got the best assortment that we ve ever had i think we have really strong marketing heading into back to school and i mentioned we re delivering new jean fits new innovative fabrics jeans are the core of our back to school business and we expect to see a healthy gain in the jeans business for back to school i think and i feel i was just actually reviewing the august set yesterday in pittsburgh and i agree with jay it looks the best it ever has so we re excited about back to school urban necessities similar to the style drop it s been a great way for us to engage new customers and to bring new traffic and excitement into the brand we re seeing a nice pickup in the men s business and total in the soho store and we are working on looking at what opportunities we might have with urban necessities going forward and how we can leverage that brand for american eagle and how american eagle can support urban necessities but it s really early days in terms of what that plan will be we re working on that dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst and just lastly bob as you think about expenses to the back half of the year is there any difference in terms of cadence for q3 and q4 and what buckets will be adjusted in q3 from q4 thank you robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah looking at the back half of the year for expenses dana i don t really expect much of a difference between q3 and q4 with the exception of as i said we ll be lapping the incremental investments we made last year you won t be seeing the dollar increases to the same magnitude and we as i said we ll be leveraging sg a expense in each of those two quarters operator thank you our next question comes from line of rebecca duval with bluefin research partners please proceed with your question rebecca duval bluefin research partners analyst good morning let me add my congratulations and thanks for taking my question bob i don t know if i missed this or not but can you talk about similar ph performance between men s versus women s and also the underperforming or i guess more inconsistent categories over that last year really been like tops and accessories and where you are with those categories today and if you re seeing some of consistent sales trends there thank you robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer sure you know i think as we mentioned the quarter was we believe there s a lot of weather impact in the quarter and the men s customer i think is more impacted by weather than the female customer men tend to realize they need clothes when the weather changes and so we did have a little bit of we had a slowdown in the men s business in the quarter the bottoms business continues to be strong especially fueled by positive comps in the long bottoms business but in total we did lose a little ground in the men s business the women s business in total continues to be strong the bottoms business another record quarter tops strong throughout the quarter and our accessories business we have been seeing a really nice recovery in the accessories business for the last few quarters that s continuing now so i think we continue the men s business is a big focus for me we continue to work to make sure we re getting our share and driving positive comps across the whole men s business the bottoms business remains strong in men s and we have more work to do in tops but we re going to start seeing some of those changes on the back half from august through the back half so hopefully we ll start to see more of a turnaround there but i do think weather is a big impact on the gender performance in the first quarter judy meehan vice president of investor relation okay thanks rebecca melissa we have time for one more question operator thank you our final question today comes from the line of simeon siegel with nomura instinet please proceed with your question dan stroller nomura instinet analyst this is dan on for simeon thanks for taking our question i was just wondering if you could share any updates on the clearance store strategy and how we should think about more conversions going forward given the growth thanks robert l madore executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thank you the clearance store strategy has been a real success for us we started it out testing five locations we had such a good result that we ve expanded it to 12 and we re looking to add another two to three locations split between the us and canada markets what we found with the test and as we re operating a greater number of stores is on liquidating clearance products we re able to realize an aur that s roughly at least 5 greater than our prior liquidation strategy so it s been very successful for us it is a little bit of a headwind as it relates to year over year comparisons on inventory levels for instance but we re realizing a greater profit on the liquidation of it and we re pretty happy with it so much so that we re looking to expand it maybe by a couple more stores we ll cap out the opportunity at no greater than roughly 15 locations in the aggregate so it s been a big success for us jennifer foyle aerie global brand president okay everybody thanks that concludes our call today thanks for your participation and have a great day thank you

seriously he firstly noted recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters fed is closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the u s economic outlook and fed will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective his comments were taken a nod to cutting interest rates if outlook worsen on trade wars vice chair richard clarida some what echoed powell s comments clarida noted policymakers would put in place policies that not only achieve but sustain price stability and maximum employment the key here is again to sustain price stability and maximum employment though he also emphasized that fed shouldn t be handcuffed to market pricing and the us is just early into yield curve inversion while is not a strong signal of concern yet as a recall st louis fed president james bullard was the first one to call for a rate cut earlier this week he noted a rate cut could be coming soon to help re center inflation and inflation expectations that would provide insurance in case of sharper than expected slowdown as global trade uncertainties have become more severe meanwhile even if the sharper than expected slowdown does not materialize a rate cut would only mean that inflation and inflation expectations return to target more rapidly chicago fed president charles evans was still confident on the economy but he s open to some policy actions he said in a cnbc interview that the economy remains solid and interest rate is at the right place and our current setting has been appropriate but if we sense that there was some greater uncertainty some softening we d have to take that into account and ask are we getting in the way of the economy dallas fed president robert kaplan was more patient regarding the impact of trade tensions between us china and mexico he said i want to take a little bit more time and be patient here because some of these recent events could be reversed worth being cognizant of the fact that these recent tensions have just elevated in the last five six weeks and in the next five six weeks a number of them could be alleviated australia gdp

would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers

median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in

base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher

nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said loading how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of

than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month

dan mitchell opinion contributor when president george w bush used the national credit card for the troubled asset relief program bailout the establishment applauded when president barack obama doubled the national debt for his failed stimulus obamacare and other boondoggles the establishment once again approved now that there s some much needed tax reform to boost american competitiveness we re supposed to suddenly believe that red ink is a national crisis what s ironic about all this pearl clutching is that the 2017 tax bill actually increases revenue beginning in 2027 according to the joint committee on taxation too bad we can t say the same about spending which routinely imposes much higher costs over time this isn t to say that america s fiscal house is in good shape or that president donald trump should be immune from criticism indeed the white house should be condemned for repeatedly busting the spending caps as part of bipartisan deals where republicans get more defense spending democrats get more domestic spending and the american people get stuck with the bill and let s not forget that trump hasn t lifted a finger on entitlements that s fiscal child abuse because we re going to hand our kids a greek style budgetary nightmare our view 22 trillion debt is no laffer ing matter the real lesson is that red ink is bad but it s only the symptom of the real problem of a federal budget that is too big and growing too fast if policymakers were serious about fixing america s finances they would copy switzerland and hong kong and adopt some sort of constitutional spending cap so that the budget over time doesn t grow faster than the private sector even researchers at international bureaucracies such as the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development have concluded that spending caps are the only effective fiscal rule but don t hold your breath waiting for the foxes in washington to put a padlock on the henhouse dan mitchell is co founder of the center for freedom and prosperity if you can t see this reader poll please refresh your page
unfortunately it seems that in terms of economic data south africa s 2019 film has begun in much the same vein as 2018 and could easily be classified within the horror genre given heightened fears that south africa could once again enter a technical recession in the first half of the year according to latest figures from statistics south africa the economy shrank by 3 2 quarter on quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised in the first quarter of 2019 the biggest plunge since the 2008 global financial crisis and the second highest drop seen in over two decades this decline was twice the number anticipated by general consensus and almost immediately saw the rand shed another 20 cents against the dollar touching r14 60 while bond yields rose by nearly 15bps growth year on year also remained flat at 0 unadjusted and means that the south african reserve bank and national treasury will likely need to revise their gdp growth expectations for 2019 downwards from around 1 3 to closer to 0 5 placing government s fiscal targets under significant strain this is not a good start to the year for ramaphosa s administration which continues to struggle with numerous legacy issues that have resulted from years of poor economic management and graft as long as economic growth remains at these kinds of mediocre levels government is not going to gain any real traction in resolving key challenges of inequality and unemployment and specifically youth unemployment government spending up key sectors down perhaps most notably the biggest positive contributor to economic growth was government 1 2 largely as a result of growth in civil service employment but while this spending made a positive contribution to gdp figures for the quarter it s not helping government s goal of reducing its expenses given our deteriorating fiscal situation there is evidently a great deal of work still ahead of ramaphosa s administration in terms of reducing headcount and making progress on the bloated public sector wage bill south africa simply can t rely on government to be one of the only three positive contributors to the gdp number if the country is to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth drought and load shedding pains the only two remaining positive contributors for the quarter were finance and personal services while all other sectors of the economy seemed to experience severe pain negatively impacted by a weak local and global environment and heightened load shedding construction 2 2 trade 3 6 transport 4 4 electricity 6 9 manufacturing 8 8 and mining 10 8 all exhibited weakness as expected while agriculture saw a substantial drop read eskom bailout risks moody s rating reserve bank says the latter is a notably small and volatile sector in the economy and the 13 2 decline largely reflects the consequences of the drought especially in the western cape but also signals a warning that many farmers are planting less as uncertainty around land weighs on the industry in terms of the expenditure side of the economy government is the sole contributor with expenditure rising by 1 3 consumers spending less meanwhile the 0 8 decline in household expenditure seen over the quarter is a clear indication that south african consumers are under severe pressure resulting from a combination of extremely high unemployment social grants which are not keeping up with inflation the increase in vat and higher fuel prices additionally the high number of upper income south africans emigrating would have represented a considerable drag on the spending ability of households in the country another worrying figure to emerge from the statistics was the 4 5 decline in gross fixed capital formation which implies that no new investments were made in the economy global woes significantly export figures declined 26 4 for the quarter signalling the extent to which the soft patch in the global environment is weighing upon the south african economy most emerging markets including south africa as well as to an extent developed markets such as the united states europe and japan have seen a decline in trade at the start of 2019 amidst slowing global growth this said fiscal stimulation in china and the us federal reserve placing interest rates on hold should create a more positive external environment in the global economy in the second half of the year which may help to support south africa s rebound from the low base line that has now been set ultimately however the global environment and external forces are slowly turning into headwinds rather than tailwinds which will make it more difficult for the local economy to finally turn the corner and achieve growth above 2

trade talk and nfp anticipation do you trade on fundamental themes or event risk see whatlive events we will cover on dailyfxahead including the ecb rate decision and nfps as well as our regular webinar series meant to help you hone your trading the fed offers some reprieve given the battering the global markets suffered friday and monday there is a keen awareness as to the state of risk amongst traders it was therefore a clear sense of relief for those reticent to shed their exposure thus far when speculative assets came up for a gulp of air this past session fed chair jerome powell supportedthis breach out of the crushing depths with the suggestion that more support may be forthcoming however mustering the same blind faith that bullish interests are back in control isn t as easy as it once was with complicated risks like trade wars and a systemic slowdown in global growth frequently reminding market participants of the landscape for now the reading is a bullish one the benchmark us indices dow s p 500and even the nasdaq were up on the day global stocks followed suit with some leaders and laggards dax versus theftse100 emerging market assets firmed and junk bonds jumped my preferred measure of risk trends under power bullish or bearish is the breadth of the move so there is little mistaking the intent this past session yet there are points of concern chart ofdow jones industrial average daily the most immediate cap to speculative momentum is drawn from the technical picture both the dow and the s p 500 offer up the same general picture a tuesday rally moved the benchmarks back to key levels that stood as important support against a reversal for two and a half months until they caved this past week the evolution of former support taking over as prevailing resistance is a familiar one in the technical analysis textbooks when a market is not primed to convert a technical break into a full tilt reversal and trend there is frequently a retest of such weighty figures with speculative interests struggling at the same level just on the opposite side of the barrier as a pace setter for the global capital markets the pattern we see in us indices is proving remarkably indicative across the range of assets and regions that shape the picture of risk chart of relative market performance benchmarked to june 1 2018 daily another purely market based observation that should raise some concern over the intent of the speculative rebound is the relative performance of those market that have acted as the leaders of the preceding climb it is always possible that a new charge for sentiment has seized control of participants conviction but that is highly improbable considering there have been so few tangible improvements in the foundations of the enthusiasm following the lines of relative strength we find equities this past session outperformed more stretched risk assets like emerging markets easily confirmed with a quick review of a ratio between the msci s all world equity index relative to its emerging market measure further honing in on the source of speculative charge these past months we find the us indices s p 500 has outperformed a benchmark for the rest of world yet the us tech sector has not taking up the responsibility for carrying us to new heights through disruption as the ftc investigation has suppressed thenasdaqcomposite and key tickers like those from google apple and facebook chart of nasdaq 100 to dow ratio daily when the distraction passes we still have trade wars and recession fears the bullish lift this past session was not an unfamiliar one at the start of this record breaking bullish cycle we were prompted to relief from the great financial crisis by the efforts of the world s largest central banks their collective drop in global interest rates and the wholesale adoption of stimulus programs helped to stave off a permanent spiral of panic and instead set the stage for opportunist speculators along the way the effort transitioned from an earnest need to stabilize the financial system and reseed growth into an overt prompt for moral hazard but it is difficult to pinpoint that tipping point for investors who have participated in this artificial windfall it is natural that they are tuned into any further support through familiar lines with many willing to respond according to the script yet monetary policy is far less the cure all that it was once considered if market participants really wanted to they could focus less on the availability of slightly cheaper funds and instead worry over the need for even more extreme accommodation and the economic financial trouble that would necessitate such policy outside of the temporary oasis of central bank support we are still dealing with burdened themes like trade wars while chinese officials are reportedly calling on the us to reopen dialogues we were also met with reports from treasury officials that presidents xi and trump are not certain to meet at the g20 at the end of this month china has also made no indication that it is diverting its efforts to work out its own blacklist for american firms in retaliation for huawei or that it no longer intends to use rare earth materials as a tool in the uneven trade war escalations perhaps one of the more encouraging if inadvertent developments for the state of trade are reports that senate republicans could block the president s efforts to apply the 5 percent tariff on all mexican imports to avoid the economic blowback that it would carry for the instigator chart ofusdmxn perhaps the most unambiguous weight to sentiment at the moment is the state of economic activity this is the foundation of financial potential with capital gains and income dependent to a greater measure on the health of an economy it is therefore troubling that the world bank s semiannual update on gdp forecasts issued a 0 3 percentage point downgrade to its 2019 projections to a 2 6 percent pace it should come as little surprise that the greatest risk to the future cited in the group s reasoning for heighted concern was the state of global trade looking ahead there is plenty of high level event risk that can be interpreted for its implications of growth the developed world s service sector pmis are particularly important consider that particular business sector accounts for the hearty majority of their output in particular the us ism non manufacturing report is at the top of my watch list remember the difficulty trading the dollar euro pound and aussie dollar with a higher level of realized volatility and technical patterns like those we find from the neckline return on the dow s head and shoulder pattern it is natural for speculative interests to be piqued yet many of these fundamental themes are as unstable as the technical patterns to which they contribute that should lead us to set realistic expectations for otherwise tempting staging the dollar is a good example after its pullback from a double top thedxyindex finds itself at some interim support the midpoint of the march to may climb that is unlikely to hold back any dedicated tides as the critical milestones are further down then again there is a hearty amount of anticipation that may discourage traders from making their calls now when there is service sector activity 1q household

this week x has brought us to more important resistance in a 12 month descending trend channel and 100 day moving average then again there seems little intent to break it without some convincing spark italy is one of the more fractious aspects to the fundamental backdrop and reports that the coalition government in the country has worked out its differences to forge ahead with an anti eu policy drive is a problem for the stability of the euro a further complication for the shared currency gaining any meaningful traction is the pull of thursday s ecb european central bank rate decision there is little chance that they add to their already extensive easing effort but speculators are unlikely to take the chance a similar state of indecision exists for the pound but the focus of its own uncertainty is far more ambiguous in both scope and time to carry on with the brexit negotiations we first need a replacement for the resigned prime minister theresa may as appealing aseurgbpmay look from purely at technical perspective consider its many eccentricities chart of eurgbp daily the most overt example of a currency that faces volatility at the same time that it is due to face extreme hurdles towards the development of trends has to be theaustralian dollar this past session the rba reserve bank of australia cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis point to a record low 1 25 percent for a carry currency that is a serious blow but there is both competition from the us dollar already sporting a 75 basis point premium and little general interest for a passive carry trade on historically low yields and differentials we could say the market was already pricing in that reduction hence the aud s slow oblivious climb but i believe there is as much disruption from the reaction

file in this aug 24 2015 file photo specialist frank masiello is reflected in his screen on the floor of the new york stock exchange the bond market is getting another whiff of a recession bonds are supposed to be the boring corner of the finance world but even high flying stock investors stop and pay attention when they fall into a particular concerning pattern it s called an inverted yield curve and it happens when investors are willing to accept lower yields for long term u s government bonds than for short term debt it s been a relatively reliable predictor for recessions and it s happening again ap photo richard drew file when a big recession hits monetary policy often isn t able to do the whole job of getting an economy back to full employment interest rate cuts eventually push rates to zero which they can t go much below alternative tools like central bank forward guidance and quantitative easing can help but even these are limited at some point the government needs to start spending money to give the economy a boost fortunately economists generally agree that fiscal stimulus is important and effective at helping battle economic slowdowns but fiscal stimulus is politically difficult unlike monetary policy which can be changed rapidly by the decisions of a few central bankers federal government spending must typically be approved by an act of congress but congress may not move quickly enough by the time debate is resolved a bill passed and spending actually begins the recession may have already been allowed to grind on for many months for example the great recession officially began in december 2007 but the american recovery and reinvestment act commonly known as the obama stimulus wasn t passed until february 2009 enter automatic stabilizers the unsung heroes of recession fighting these are spending and tax policies that tend to be triggered automatically when there s a recession and recede when there s a boom for example when the economy slumps more people claim food stamps unemployment insurance housing vouchers and other benefits that go either to those with low incomes or those who are out of work similarly when people s incomes drop because they get laid off their taxes go down which helps them maintain their consumption through the bad times the congressional budget office estimates that these automatic stabilizers amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus during the great recession automatic stabilizers are good because they happen much quicker than stimulus legislation and therefore start fighting a recession as soon as it happens there s plenty of scope to expand automatic stabilizers first of all simply increasing federal and state benefits for poor people will improve the economy s resilience to recession lower income americans spending tends to fluctuate much more with the condition of the economy probably because they are financially constrained and unable to borrow to make it through bad times macroeconomists ricardo reis and alisdair mckay argue that increasing spending on programs like food stamps will make aggregate demand much more stable other economists have made the case that europe s generous social insurance policies have helped reduce macroeconomic volatility there expanding social programs costs money even in good times which adds to budget deficits over the long term if the government wants to avoid committing to larger structural deficits it can design spending programs that only kick in or only ramp up during recessions many economists are now proposing ideas for how to do this for example ben spielberg of the center on budget and policy priorities a think tank has suggested a program that increases the share of medicaid costs paid by the federal government as soon as growth drops others have suggested disbursing more infrastructure funds welfare payments and federal assistance to state governments when the economy slows down an even more ambitious idea comes from economist claudia sahm at the federal reserve board under sahm s proposal the federal government would simply mail checks to all americans when a recession hits lump sum payments would be made to all individuals when the national unemployment rate rises by at least 0 50 percentage points the individual payments would total either 0 7 percent of gdp or 1 percent of personal consumption expenditures this formula is now being called the sahm rule the sahm rule would be quite a big stimulus if these direct payments had a fiscal multiplier of two in other words if each dollar of payments stimulated an additional dollar of private spending as the money worked its way through the economy then it would raise growth by about 1 4 percent since every percentage point of growth tends to lower unemployment by about a third of a percent a relationship known as okun s law this would cancel out essentially all of the 0 5 percent rise in unemployment that triggered the spending of course most recessions raise unemployment by a lot more than 0 5 percent so this wouldn t be enough to instantly reverse a downturn sahm would add additional automatic payments in subsequent years of the recession but the initial burst of spending would help take the edge off the sahm rule would be an even more effective stimulus if the payments were targeted specifically to lower income americans instead of to everyone but the political appeal of universality and the ease of administration might outweigh the economic expediency of means tested payments instead of waiting for the next crisis to hit the u s should prepare in advance implementing more automatic stabilizers that instantly deploy in a recession would provide a front line of defense that would blunt the onset of every downturn to come courtesy noah smith op ed mug noah smith is a bloomberg opinion columnist he was an assistant professor of finance at stony brook university and he blogs at noahpinion
in sunny miami bilingual elementary teacher mari corugedo has 26 years of experience a master s degree and a passion for helping spanish speaking students quickly learn english her annual compensation for those skills 64 000 plus benefits that doesn t go far in this popular coastal city where median rent has shot up to almost 2 000 per month and the median mortgage is almost 1 300 per month before taxes or insurance according to the real estate site zillow we spend a good 30 to 40 of our income on our mortgage said corugedo 52 i would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers more i am a teacher with a 2nd job in mississippi you bust your behind hoping you ll get ahead in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis new teachers can also afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of education according to the economic policy institute the nonprofit think tank which receives funding from labor unions examined decades of federal data growing unrest over low pay sparked teacher walkouts last year in states such as arizona oklahoma and west virginia wages have continued to be at the heart of teacher demonstrations in 2019 have teacher strikes worked how a west virginia teacher s facebook post started a national movement americans support striking teachers their unions are another matter entirely poll says meanwhile education workers are leaving their jobs at the fastest rate on record according to government data first reported by the wall street journal both political parties have taken note republicans who trimmed education budgets over the past decade are starting to pivot texas gov greg abbott has announced a 1 6 billion pay hike for teachers south carolina gov henry mcmaster approved a state budget that included about 160 million for teacher raises among democrats running for president former vice president joe biden has proposed tripling federal money for low income schools in part to give teachers raises u s sen kamala harris from california wants to give the average american teacher a 13 500 raise or enough to cover the gap between teachers and other college educated workers that would cost the federal government about 315 billion over 10 years many mid career teachers need a side hustle for now just under half of the metropolitan areas studied 135 are affordable for teachers earning a median wage for teachers in the rest of the country the hustle continues year after year in the clairton school district in western pennsylvania fifth grade teacher stacie baur earns about 43 100 per year her bachelor s and master s degrees saddled her with 130 000 in debt for extra income she rises before 4 a m every day to teach children in china how to speak english via a video feed baur earns 10 50 for each 25 minute class during the week she ll teach four in a row before rushing to clairton on the weekends she teaches 10 classes each day baur and her husband live 25 minutes from clairton in pittsburgh because they like the city housing in clairton is cheaper but they found a great deal on a pittsburgh apartment for 850 per month baur 33 doesn t see herself owning a home or starting a family anytime soon we haven t been able to save for the down payment yet baur said it s hard to save when things keep getting more expensive these mid career teachers are still struggling in some areas teachers are struggling because their pay doesn t increase much even as they gain more years of experience on average in the metros analyzed usa today found that elementary school teachers salaries grow by 31 322 after taxes as they moved from the bottom to the top of the pay scale but in some metro areas teachers salaries increased far less than that in the districts around enid oklahoma a state where teachers went on strike in 2018 to protest some of the lowest pay in the country salaries start around 32 000 the top 10 of earners in the largely rural area are only pocketing 48 000 after federal taxes according to usa today s analysis in enid public schools salaries ranged from about 38 000 to about 60 000 this past year according to the state teachers union jennie scott an elementary teacher in enid said health insurance costs make the area tough to afford scott said she paid 200 monthly for family coverage when she taught in georgia now it s 700 monthly out of pocket if she wants to pay for health insurance for the family a lot of teachers i know have insurance for themselves but not their husband and kids she said they just pray it will work out salaries in oklahoma are inching up public school teachers received an average 6 100 pay bump after the walkouts in 2018 and they ll receive another average 1 220 pay bump this year over on the east coast school districts generally pay higher salaries but housing is more expensive too ryan brown a bridgeport connecticut middle school teacher lives at his parents place 45 minutes away because he can t afford rent in bridgeport before taxes brown s six years of experience earn him about 56 000 a year he also spends two nights a week tutoring that nets him an additional 600 per month which is helping him pay down 11 000 in student loans teachers don t usually make a lot of money out of the gate said brown 29 but the steady incline is not as steady as you think brown has joined educators for excellence a group that s backing a bill in connecticut that would allow cities to create affordable housing programs for teachers some teachers have left u s entirely overseas teaching jobs give fair salary housing respect low pay can be offset by really cheap housing in rural texas teacher sarah mcmanus has 12 years of experience and works at a middle school in henderson about two hours from dallas she only earns 42 000 annually before taxes but she and her husband who works in medical billing can easily afford a home with five bedrooms two bathrooms and a swimming pool they bought the house for about 140 000 the monthly mortgage is only about 1 200 and their property taxes are negligible when she lived in dallas mcmanus worked in the gig economy to help supplement her salary as a single teacher now she appreciates the affordability of country living but she still misses some big city perks i see my students around town every day and i have a seven minute commute to school mcmanus said but i do miss the mall and the symphony and wearing heels for senior teachers most metros are affordable america s top earning teachers can afford the median rent in almost all the metro areas usa today studied specifically 249 out of 291 in new york city s public schools teacher salaries range from about 61 000 to about 129 000 according to the specifics of the 2019 2022 contract reported by chalkbeat an education news site that s all before taxes salaries for teachers in charter and private schools in the nyc metro area can be less partly because of those high end salaries a city that s legendary for expensive apartments is actually affordable for an individual teacher once he or she reaches the top of the pay scale teachers in the top 10 of earners in the new york metro area would need to spend about 28 of their salaries to afford the city s median rent according to usa today s analysis now consider baltimore ap statistics teacher jackie secor is in her 12th year of teaching in the baltimore city school district where she earns about 93 000 in base pay before taxes the 34 year old receives a special pay boost for exemplary teachers secor lives just outside the city in a three bedroom one and a half bath home that she shares with her husband an architect and two kids their mortgage is about 2 000 monthly secor said she s never had trouble affording rent as a starting teacher she earned about 43 000 and lived with a roommate by her fifth or sixth year she paid 1 100 per month on an apartment for herself baltimore pays really well and it s affordable secor said i hear people complain about class size but not about pay some metros are too expensive for all teachers the list of metro areas that are never affordable for teachers is mostly unsurprising the california tech hubs of san jose and san francisco lead the list along with leisurely ritzy napa honolulu hawaii is up there as well paradise living with 2 roommates in a dump hawaii is too expensive for teachers then there s miami in usa today s analysis top earning elementary teachers around miami only took home about 58 000 after taxes with local rent at around 1 900 per month that means even the highest paid teachers would spend more than a third of their salaries on housing corugedo the veteran bilingual teacher said rising housing prices have driven young teachers out of miami it s a big factor in the district s teacher shortage she said a lot of my colleagues have to tutor work a second job or do after school care for other people s children corugedo said the community has started to respond miami residents approved a property tax referendum in fall 2018 that put 211 million toward teacher raises the largest rental company in miami dade county now offers move in discounts for educators corugedo she said she s lucky her combined income allows her to afford her house her husband has a good job with ups a position that didn t even require a college degree he makes a lot more than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
the reserve bank cut interest rates on tuesday because we aren t spending or pushing up prices at anything like the rate it would like and things are even worse than it might have realised as the board met in martin place in sydney in canberra at 11 30 am the bureau of statistics released details of retail spending in april one month beyond the march quarter figures the bank was using to make its decision they show the dollars spent in shops fell in april slipping 0 1 per cent notwithstanding weakly growing prices and a more strongly growing population the march quarter figures the board was looking at were adjusted for prices they show that the volume of goods and services bought but not the amount paid for them fell in seasonally adjusted terms during the march quarter adjusted for population the volume bought would have fallen further we ll know more today the bureau of statistics will release population adjusted figures as part of the national accounts today the figures for

ourselves as reserve bank governor philip lowe said in announcing the rates decision on tuesday the main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for household consumption which is being affected by a protracted period of low income growth and declining housing prices the bank wants both inflation and employment higher and it wants us to spend more in order to do it lower rates should help although not for everybody mr lowe acknowledged this in a speech to a sydney business audience on tuesday night but he said households paid two dollars in interest for every one dollar of interest they received so while rate cuts hurt savers they benefit borrowers by more and over time should benefit all households by boosting the economy they also drive the dollar lower making australian businesses more competitive this cut will free up an extra a 60 a month for a typical mortgage holder another one will free up a total of 120 it s not much and there s doubt about whether it would do much but interest rates are about the only tool the reserve bank has it is required by its agreement with the government to aim for an inflation rate of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent on average over time treasurer and reserve bank governor statement on the conduct of monetary policy september 19 2016 reserve bank of australia uncomfortably for governor lowe underlying inflation abstracting from unusual moves which are quickly reversed has been below 2 per cent ever since he was appointed governor in late 2016 explaining his push for higher inflation to a business audience in sydney on tuesday night he said that while adherence to the target was intended to be flexible that flexibility was not boundless if inflation stays too low for too long it is possible that inflation expectations move lower that australians come to expect sub 2 per cent inflation on an ongoing basis if this were to happen it would be harder to achieve the medium term inflation goal so we need to guard against this possibility he is also required to aim for full employment he told the business audience that while for some years the bank and others had thought full employment meant an unemployment rate of 5 per cent the absence of inflation at 5 per cent and the persistence of underemployment where people wanted more hours meant it could and should go lower our judgement now is that we can do better than this that we can sustain an unemployment rate of 4 point something he said lower interest rates should help by making it easier for businesses to borrow to expand and giving consumers something in their pockets to buy from them if you don t succeed if that doesn t happen the bank will cut again tuesday s statement as good as said so the board will continue to monitor developments in the labour market closely and adjust monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and the achievement of the inflation target over time tuesday s cut and the next will take the bank into uncharted waters where its so called cash rate what it pays to banks to deposit money with it overnight is close to zero as far as can be discerned it has never been that low in the 100 years the reserve bank has been in operation originally as the commonwealth bank of australia reserve bank cash rate since 1990 reserve bank cash rate since 1990 reserve bank of australia should inflation still not pick up and employment still not fall as far as it believes it could it will have to effectively cut its cash rate below zero forcing cash into the hands of banks by aggressively buying government bonds giving them little choice but to lend it to households and businesses in a process known as quantitative easing it has been done in the united states europe the united kingdom and japan and is by now anything but unconventional governor lowe would prefer the government to pull its weight by cutting tax and boosting spending especially on infrastructure and by policies that make australia more productive he said so on tuesday night the best approach to delivering lower unemployment and a stronger economy is through structural policies that support firms expanding investing innovating and employing people as we ease monetary policy it is in the country s interest that other policy options are considered too frydenberg s biggest concern treasurer josh frydenberg gets it he pointed out on tuesday that the yet to be approved tax offsets in the budget will give australians on up to 126 000 a cash bonus of up to 1 080 when they submit this year s tax return far more than the rate cut his biggest concern and the biggest concern of the governor might be that they don t spend it another concern would be that the banks don t pass the rate cut on the anz has said it will only cut mortgage rates by 0 18 points instead of the full 0 25 a decision frydenberg said let down customers westpac has cut by only 0 20 points the national australia and commonwealth banks have passed on the cut in full on tuesday night in sydney governor lowe addressed the question of whether the banks should have passed on the full cut head on my usual practice in answering this question has been to explain that there are a range of other factors that influence mortgage pricing and then say it all depends today though i would like to break with my usual practice and provide a clearer answer and that is yes there has been a substantial reduction in the cost of banks raising funds in wholesale markets average rates on retail deposits have also come down this means that the lower cash rate should be fully passed through into standard variable mortgage rates full pass through would also mean that the economy receives the full benefit of today s policy decision loading the governor is concerned that for their own reasons lenders such as anz and westpac are forcing him to cut rates lower than he should and making an already difficult job harder if he has to cut further he will but with the cash rate at just 1 25 per cent he would dearly love not to have to peter martin is a visiting fellow at the crawford school of public policy australian national university this

the innovation of australia s inflation target was to avoid the sort of rigid mechanical implementation the pioneers of inflation targeting the reserve bank of new zealand had initially put in place in the australian framework inflation would be measured over the course of the cycle and as a central tendency rather than a fixed number or bounded range above all the target would not be applied mechanically but the flexibility incorporated at that time is not enough to cope with the current environment low interest rates introduce distortions in financial markets borrowing decisions especially in housing portfolio choices investment decisions the exchange rate and income distribution will all be distorted some of these distortions may be helpful in the short term but as interest rates depart further from normal and stay away for a longer period of time it becomes more likely the distortions will be unhelpful to the longer term stability and functioning of the economy what additional consideration might go into monetary policy settings paul samuelson noted that if real interest rates were negative and expected to remain so it would be profitable to flatten the rockies to reduce transport costs he said this in jest but the serious point is that negative real interest rates don t make much sense in short australia together with most advanced economies has operated unbalanced macro policies since the gfc what then if monetary policy is pedal to the metal already providing all the stimulus that it can usefully provide and yet the economy is still operating below capacity attention should turn to the other arm of macro policy fiscal policy fiscal policy has been largely relieved of the task of assisting the economy through the cycle largely confined to automatic stabilisers such as unemployment benefits academics argue about the effectiveness of fiscal policy but the experience during the global financial crisis both here and overseas is that fiscal policy is powerfully effective advertisement the gfc took the budget into substantial deficit in australia as elsewhere but the ensuing period has seen a substantial shift towards balance this shift gets universal applause but the inevitable cost has been a contractionary impulse what matters for the impact of the budget on activity is not the position e g a deficit but the change in the budget position with a persistent shift towards balance subtracting from growth in short australia together with most advanced economies has operated unbalanced macro policies since the gfc expansionary monetary policy opposing contractionary fiscal policy restoring budget balance is politically popular the major political parties compete to promise greater fiscal rectitude in america however some leading economists have broken away from this conventional view former us treasury secretary larry summers and former imf chief economist olivier blanchard are active advocates for budget deficits the usual fears about debt and deficits haven t eventuated financial markets have readily absorbed the big increases in public debt without putting upward pressure on interest rates blanchard spells out the mechanics of low interest rates when the interest rate is lower than the nominal gdp growth rate a balanced budget reduces the ratio of public debt to gdp over time a modest deficit would keep the debt ratio constant and australia starts with low public debt by international comparison low interest rates have weakened the power of monetary policy but at the same time have created an opportunity for effective fiscal stimulus if australia is caught in the maelstrom of donald trump s tariff tussle fiscal policy should be ready to play the leading counter cyclical role stephen grenville is a non resident fellow at the lowy institute and a former deputy governor of the reserve bank of australia
unfortunately it seems that in terms of economic data south africa s 2019 film has begun in much the same vein as 2018 and could easily be classified within the horror genre given heightened fears that south africa could once again enter a technical recession in the first half of the year according to latest figures from statistics south africa the economy shrank by 3 2 quarter on quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised in the first quarter of 2019 the biggest plunge since the 2008 global financial crisis and the second highest drop seen in over two decades this decline was twice the number anticipated by general consensus and almost immediately saw the rand shed another 20 cents against the dollar touching r14 60 while bond yields rose by nearly 15bps growth year on year also remained flat at 0 unadjusted and means that the south african reserve bank and national treasury will likely need to revise their gdp growth expectations for 2019 downwards from around 1 3 to closer to 0 5 placing government s fiscal targets under significant strain this is not a good start to the year for ramaphosa s administration which continues to struggle with numerous legacy issues that have resulted from years of poor economic management and graft as long as economic growth remains at these kinds of mediocre levels government is not going to gain any real traction in resolving key challenges of inequality and unemployment and specifically youth unemployment government spending up key sectors down perhaps most notably the biggest positive contributor to economic growth was government 1 2 largely as a result of growth in civil service employment but while this spending made a positive contribution to gdp figures for the quarter it s not helping government s goal of reducing its expenses given our deteriorating fiscal situation there is evidently a great deal of work still ahead of ramaphosa s administration in terms of reducing headcount and making progress on the bloated public sector wage bill south africa simply can t rely on government to be one of the only three positive contributors to the gdp number if the country is to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth drought and load shedding pains the only two remaining positive contributors for the quarter were finance and personal services while all other sectors of the economy seemed to experience severe pain negatively impacted by a weak local and global environment and heightened load shedding construction 2 2 trade 3 6 transport 4 4 electricity 6 9 manufacturing 8 8 and mining 10 8 all exhibited weakness as expected while agriculture saw a substantial drop read eskom bailout risks moody s rating reserve bank says the latter is a notably small and volatile sector in the economy and the 13 2 decline largely reflects the consequences of the drought especially in the western cape but also signals a warning that many farmers are planting less as uncertainty around land weighs on the industry in terms of the expenditure side of the economy government is the sole contributor with expenditure rising by 1 3 consumers spending less meanwhile the 0 8 decline in household expenditure seen over the quarter is a clear indication that south african consumers are under severe pressure resulting from a combination of extremely high unemployment social grants which are not keeping up with inflation the increase in vat and higher fuel prices additionally the high number of upper income south africans emigrating would have represented a considerable drag on the spending ability of households in the country another worrying figure to emerge from the statistics was the 4 5 decline in gross fixed capital formation which implies that no new investments were made in the economy global woes significantly export figures declined 26 4 for the quarter signalling the extent to which the soft patch in the global environment is weighing upon the south african economy most emerging markets including south africa as well as to an extent developed markets such as the united states europe and japan have seen a decline in trade at the start of 2019 amidst slowing global growth this said fiscal stimulation in china and the us federal reserve placing interest rates on hold should create a more positive external environment in the global economy in the second half of the year which may help to support south africa s rebound from the low base line that has now been set ultimately however the global environment and external forces are slowly turning into headwinds rather than tailwinds which will make it more difficult for the local economy to finally turn the corner and achieve growth above 2
in sunny miami bilingual elementary teacher mari corugedo has 26 years of experience a master s degree and a passion for helping spanish speaking students quickly learn english her annual compensation for those skills 64 000 plus benefits that doesn t go far in this popular coastal city where median rent has shot up to almost 2 000 per month and the median mortgage is almost 1 300 per month before taxes or insurance according to the real estate site zillow we spend a good 30 to 40 of our income on our mortgage said corugedo 52 i would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis new teachers can also afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of education according to the economic policy institute the nonprofit think tank which receives funding from labor unions examined decades of federal data growing unrest over low pay sparked teacher walkouts last year in states such as arizona oklahoma and west virginia wages have continued to be at the heart of teacher demonstrations in 2019 have teacher strikes worked how a west virginia teacher s facebook post started a national movement americans support striking teachers their unions are another matter entirely poll says meanwhile education workers are leaving their jobs at the fastest rate on record according to government data first reported by the wall street journal both political parties have taken note republicans who trimmed education budgets over the past decade are starting to pivot texas gov greg abbott has announced a 1 6 billion pay hike for teachers south carolina gov henry mcmaster approved a state budget that included about 160 million for teacher raises among democrats running for president former vice president joe biden has proposed tripling federal money for low income schools in part to give teachers raises u s sen kamala harris from california wants to give the average american teacher a 13 500 raise or enough to cover the gap between teachers and other college educated workers that would cost the federal government about 315 billion over 10 years many mid career teachers need a side hustle for now just under half of the metropolitan areas studied 135 are affordable for teachers earning a median wage for teachers in the rest of the country the hustle continues year after year in the clairton school district in western pennsylvania fifth grade teacher stacie baur earns about 43 100 per year her bachelor s and master s degrees saddled her with 130 000 in debt for extra income she rises before 4 a m every day to teach children in china how to speak english via a video feed baur earns 10 50 for each 25 minute class during the week she ll teach four in a row before rushing to clairton on the weekends she teaches 10 classes each day baur and her husband live 25 minutes from clairton in pittsburgh because they like the city housing in clairton is cheaper but they found a great deal on a pittsburgh apartment for 850 per month baur 33 doesn t see herself owning a home or starting a family anytime soon we haven t been able to save for the down payment yet baur said it s hard to save when things keep getting more expensive these mid career teachers are still struggling in some areas teachers are struggling because their pay doesn t increase much even as they gain more years of experience on average in the metros analyzed usa today found that elementary school teachers salaries grow by 31 322 after taxes as they moved from the bottom to the top of the pay scale but in some metro areas teachers salaries increased far less than that in the districts around enid oklahoma a state where teachers went on strike in 2018 to protest some of the lowest pay in the country salaries start around 32 000 the top 10 of earners in the largely rural area are only pocketing 48 000 after federal taxes according to usa today s analysis in enid public schools salaries ranged from about 38 000 to about 60 000 this past year according to the state teachers union jennie scott an elementary teacher in enid said health insurance costs make the area tough to afford scott said she paid 200 monthly for family coverage when she taught in georgia now it s 700 monthly out of pocket if she wants to pay for health insurance for the family a lot of teachers i know have insurance for themselves but not their husband and kids she said they just pray it will work out salaries in oklahoma are inching up public school teachers received an average 6 100 pay bump after the walkouts in 2018 and they ll receive another average 1 220 pay bump this year over on the east coast school districts generally pay higher salaries but housing is more expensive too ryan brown a bridgeport connecticut middle school teacher lives at his parents place 45 minutes away because he can t afford rent in bridgeport before taxes brown s six years of experience earn him about 56 000 a year he also spends two nights a week tutoring that nets him an additional 600 per month which is helping him pay down 11 000 in student loans teachers don t usually make a lot of money out of the gate said brown 29 but the steady incline is not as steady as you think brown has joined educators for excellence a group that s backing a bill in connecticut that would allow cities to create affordable housing programs for teachers some teachers have left u s entirely overseas teaching jobs give fair salary housing respect low pay can be offset by really cheap housing in rural texas teacher sarah mcmanus has 12 years of experience and works at a middle school in henderson about two hours from dallas she only earns 42 000 annually before taxes but she and her husband who works in medical billing can easily afford a home with five bedrooms two bathrooms and a swimming pool they bought the house for about 140 000 the monthly mortgage is only about 1 200 and their property taxes are negligible when she lived in dallas mcmanus worked in the gig economy to help supplement her salary as a single teacher now she appreciates the affordability of country living but she still misses some big city perks i see my students around town every day and i have a seven minute commute to school mcmanus said but i do miss the mall and the symphony and wearing heels for senior teachers most metros are affordable america s top earning teachers can afford the median rent in almost all the metro areas usa today studied specifically 249 out of 291 in new york city s public schools teacher salaries range from about 61 000 to about 129 000 according to the specifics of the 2019 2022 contract reported by chalkbeat an education news site that s all before taxes salaries for teachers in charter and private schools in the nyc metro area can be less partly because of those high end salaries a city that s legendary for expensive apartments is actually affordable for an individual teacher once he or she reaches the top of the pay scale teachers in the top 10 of earners in the new york metro area would need to spend about 28 of their salaries to afford the city s median rent according to usa today s analysis now consider baltimore ap statistics teacher jackie secor is in her 12th year of teaching in the baltimore city school district where she earns about 93 000 in base pay before taxes the 34 year old receives a special pay boost for exemplary teachers secor lives just outside the city in a three bedroom one and a half bath home that she shares with her husband an architect and two kids their mortgage is about 2 000 monthly secor said she s never had trouble affording rent as a starting teacher she earned about 43 000 and lived with a roommate by her fifth or sixth year she paid 1 100 per month on an apartment for herself baltimore pays really well and it s affordable secor said i hear people complain about class size but not about pay some metros are too expensive for all teachers the list of metro areas that are never affordable for teachers is mostly unsurprising the california tech hubs of san jose and san francisco lead the list along with leisurely ritzy napa honolulu hawaii is up there as well paradise living with 2 roommates in a dump hawaii is too expensive for teachers then there s miami in usa today s analysis top earning elementary teachers around miami only took home about 58 000 after taxes with local rent at around 1 900 per month that means even the highest paid teachers would spend more than a third of their salaries on housing corugedo the veteran bilingual teacher said rising housing prices have driven young teachers out of miami it s a big factor in the district s teacher shortage she said a lot of my colleagues have to tutor work a second job or do after school care for other people s children corugedo said the community has started to respond miami residents approved a property tax referendum in fall 2018 that put 211 million toward teacher raises the largest rental company in miami dade county now offers move in discounts for educators corugedo she said she s lucky her combined income allows her to afford her house her husband has a good job with ups a position that didn t even require a college degree he makes a lot more than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
the reserve bank cut interest rates on tuesday because we aren t spending or pushing up prices at anything like the rate it would like and things are even worse than it might have realised as the board met in martin place in sydney in canberra at 11 30 am the bureau of statistics released details of retail spending in april one month beyond the march quarter figures the bank was using to make its decision they show the dollars spent in shops fell in april slipping 0 1 notwithstanding weakly growing prices and a more strongly growing population the march quarter figures the board was looking at were adjusted for prices they show that the volume of goods and services bought but not the amount paid for them fell in seasonally adjusted terms during the march quarter adjusted for population the volume bought would have fallen further the bureau of statistics will release population adjusted figures as part of the national accounts on wednesday the figures for the september quarter show that income and spending per person barely grew the figures for the december quarter show income and spending per person fell a second fall in the march quarter will mean two in a row what some people call a per capita recession even unadjusted for population economic growth is dismal during the september and december quarters the economy grew just 0 3 and 0 2 an annualised rate of

for some time the four horsemen of us macroeconomic policymaking have been taxation regulation trade and infrastructure having studied the first in detail i have found tax cuts to be a positive contributor to economic growth though i have considered the second area in less detail the evidence suggests that regulation is at best only a minor contributor to growth the third area is very important which is why today s trade tensions are so worrying the fourth area exists only in rhetoric an infrastructure program is currently not a part of the macroeconomic policy repertoire in the first area i estimate that the 2017 tax legislation added 1 1 per year to the united states gdp growth rate for 2018 19 of that 0 9 percentage points reflected the reduced tax rate on individuals whereas 0 2 percentage points derived from the rate cuts and improved expensing provisions for businesses while the growth enhancing effect of the tax cuts for individuals is not expected to continue beyond 2019 the impact of the corporate tax reform will likely persist for some time to come as for the second horseman there is some indication that the expansion of federal regulations has begun to taper off after undergoing a long period of growth as of 2017 regdata which tracks the number of words relating to constraints on economic activity in the federal register shows that new regulations have plateaued the regulatory burden on business and economic activity is no longer rising but it is not diminishing either likewise the world bank s doing business profile for the us which offers a broader measure of government regulation based on an average of ten indicators show no recent progress the us rose from eighth place in 2016 to sixth place in 2017 in the global ranking only to fall back to eighth in 2018 and putting aside relative performance a cardinal representation of the underlying indicators shows virtually no change in the 2016 2018 period as many other economists have noted us president donald trump s trade policies are a major concern the administration s trade agenda is driven by the discredited mercantilist idea that selling stuff exports is good and buying stuff imports is bad the irony is that trump and some of his top trade advisers share this misguided view with the chinese indeed the trump administration is correct that the chinese have long restricted imports and foreign investment while engaging in technology theft either directly or by compelling transfers but the tit for tat exchange of import tariffs between the us and china over the past year is bad for both countries many assume that the trade conflict will hurt china more than the us given that china exports far more to america than america exports to china but the loss of chinese imports will impose a major burden on the us economy trump s views on tariffs remind me of a speech that ronald reagan gave at stanford s hoover institution before he became president reagan argued that tariffs on steel and other goods were justified on national security grounds his reasoning criticised by audience members was almost the same as trump s today yet to justify his tariffs trump has gone even further equating national security with economic security the best way to invalidate that argument on legal grounds then is simply to have an economist show in court why tariffs are bad for economic security the broader problem is that trump seems to have a personal affection for tariffs partly because he thinks they raise revenue and partly because he thinks they raise gdp by curbing imports which are then magically replaced by domestic production this challenge does not admit of an easy remedy some have called on congress to reassert its authority over tariffs at least by limiting the national security argument but this could have unintended long term consequences given that presidents since the 1930s have tended to be far more supportive of free trade than have members of congress each of whom represents the interests of a narrower constituency the hope now is that mutually harmful tariffs will lead to an agreement whereby china liberalises its trade policies at which point import barriers will be removed but though this to add irony to irony would benefit china more than the us the situation is fraught with uncertainty about the outcome fueling the volatility of global stock markets and whatever happens with china we still have to worry that trump will impose tariffs on mexico europe japan and so on as for infrastructure the potential benefits to us productivity from increased investment are real yet nothing has happened the situation is best encapsulated by an april meeting between trump and congressional leaders according to media reports trump began by proposing to spend 1 trillion on infrastructure whereupon the democrats countered by suggesting 2 trillion trump apparently agreed to that with little hesitation all in all the exchange confirms once again that both parties have come to regard government spending as a free lunch at least when it is financed by debt or the creation of new money perhaps it is actually for the best that infrastructure week never goes anywhere given the state of us macroeconomic policy it is not surprising that the federal reserve bank of atlanta s latest gdpnow report forecasts second quarter gdp growth of 1 3 down from 3 1 in the first quarter the 2017 tax reform would still be promoting economic growth if not for the escalating trade tensions sadly a growth rate of close

car accidents are relatively common occurrences train wrecks are a little more out of the ordinary to be sure one would be hard pressed however to find many examples of a 15 lane pileup of 435 cars 100 semi trucks three trains and a small army of app rent scooters strangling the center of the capital of the united states of america except of course in the federal budget year after year the federal government passes spending bills so riddled with wasteful spending crony handouts and thoughtless debt accumulation that it s pretty much like a massive car crash so awful to watch that you can t even look away congress is once again considering a massive spending increase that could end up being a near total fiscal wreck dubbed a caps deal it s long past time for congress to take a serious and sober look at america s debt addiction and hit the brakes on out of control spending to avoid further deficit disasters the heritage foundation s blueprint for balance chapter titled the fiscal outlook explains what exactly a fiscal catastrophe looks like and what consequences are in store for all of us involved with the gross national debt in excess of 22 trillion nearly 105 of gross domestic product and mandatory spending like interest on previous debt social security medicare and medicaid consuming 72 of current tax revenue it s easy to think that america s fiscal woes have reached their worst point but that s not true our debt problems are about to get much worse looking at projections by the congressional budget office congress official federal scorekeeper one sees that the federal budget is on a rapid collision course with out of control deficits by 2025 the mere interest payments on the national debt are set to eclipse defense spending for a household this would be the equivalent of incurring credit card bills every month that are the same size as their mortgage payments meanwhile mandatory and entitlement programs are accelerating on auto pilot on course to consume the entirety of government revenue in just over 20 years this would mean that all spending set by congress defense education welfare infrastructure foreign aid tax expenditures and national security would need to be funded solely by deficits or congress would need to raise taxes significantly yet it is not merely a bad outlook by the numbers it s one thing to see the deficit problem as a current budgetary catastrophe but it s another to see it as a roadblock to future success as noted by economists at the mercatus center and others at the international monetary fund high national debt can seriously hamper a country s economic growth with creeping effects that result in a sudden and unpredictable crisis an increase in public debt beyond a certain sustainable threshold is associated with depressed economic growth with effects worsening when researchers factor in high private debt however higher debt also makes the u s a riskier buy for bond markets and interest rates might eventually soar if investors become more wary of the federal government s promise to service the debt left on the current trajectory high debt could very well threaten the ability of the american people to sit in the driver s seat of our economy the task of steering the federal government toward a sound and sustainable budget is possible only when one understands what exactly is wrong with the current budget and the problems it presents for america s future the heritage foundation s blueprint for balance offers a glimpse of the disaster ridden road to the future paved by fiscally reckless legislation and budgetary abdication but it also provides a panoramic view of the expressway of prosperity that limited and responsible american government could enable indeed with responsible spending fiscal discipline and honest legislation the united states can avoid the costly damages of washington s annual budgetary car wreck and pave the way for economic security and sustainable growth congress should begin this year by passing an actual budget that slows the growth in spending and the debt reforms entitlements and extends the tax cuts of 2017 permanently immediately lawmakers should refuse any caps deal or other spending increase without commensurate spending offsets to avoid doing further damage

story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets

story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
president donald trump s plan to impose tariffs on mexican exports unless our neighbor does something he hasn t specified what to stop the flow of asylum seekers is almost surely illegal u s trade law gives presidents discretion to impose tariffs for a number of reasons but curbing immigration isn t one of them it s also a clear violation of u s international agreements and it will reduce the living standards of most americans destroy many jobs in u s manufacturing and hurt farmers but let s put all of that to one side and talk about the really bad stuff trump says that tariff is a beautiful word indeed but the actual history of u s tariffs isn t pretty and not just because tariffs whatever the tweeter in chief says are in practice taxes on americans not foreigners in fact it s now a good bet that trump s tariffs will more than wipe out whatever breaks middle class americans got from the 2017 tax cut the more important fact is that until the 1930s tariff policy was a cesspool of corruption and special interest politics one of the main purposes of the 1934 reciprocal trade agreements act which eventually became the template for the modern world trading system was to drain that particular swamp by removing the capriciousness of previous tariff policy trump s erratic trade actions unconstrained by what we used to think were the legal rules have brought the capriciousness back and good old fashioned corruption if it isn t happening already won t be far behind advertising beyond that tariff policy is inextricably linked with the united states role as a global superpower central to that role is the expectation that the u s will be both reliable and responsible that it will honor whatever agreements it makes and more broadly that it will make policy with an eye to the effects of its actions on the rest of the world trump is throwing all that away his mexican tariffs violate both nafta which was supposed to guarantee free movement of goods within north america and our obligations under the world trade organization which like u s law permits new tariffs only under certain specified conditions so america has become a lawless actor in world markets a tariff policy rogue state but there s more by deploying tariffs as a bludgeon against whatever he doesn t like trump is returning america to the kind of irresponsibility it displayed after world war i irresponsibility that while obviously not the sole or even the main cause of the great depression the rise of fascism and the eventual coming of world war ii helped create the environment for these disasters it is i believe pretty widely known that america turned its back on the world after world war i refusing to join the league of nations slamming the doors shut on most immigration fortunately a few years after my grandparents got here what s less known i suspect is that america also took a sharply protectionist turn long before the infamous 1930 smoot hawley act in early 1921 congress enacted the emergency tariff act soon followed by the fordney mccumber tariff of 1922 these actions more than doubled average tariffs on dutiable imports like trump the advocates of these tariffs claimed that they would bring prosperity to all americans they didn t there was indeed a manufacturing boom driven not by tariffs but by new products like affordable cars and new technologies like the assembly line farmers however spent the 1920s suffering from low prices for their products and high prices for farm equipment leading to a surge in foreclosures advertising part of the problem was that u s tariffs were met with retaliation even before the depression struck the world was engaged in a gradually escalating trade war making things even worse u s tariffs put our world war i allies in an impossible position we expected them to repay their huge war debts but our tariffs made it impossible for them to earn the dollars they needed to make those payments and the trade war debt nexus created a climate of international distrust and bitterness that contributed to the economic and political crises of the 1930s this experience had a profound effect on u s policy after world war ii which was based on the view that free trade and peace went hand in hand so am i saying that trump is repeating the policy errors america made a century ago no this time it s much worse do

agreements in a fit of pique while america in the 1920s failed to help build international institutions it didn t do a trump and actively try to undermine them and while u s leaders between the wars may have turned a blind eye to the rise of racist dictatorships they generally didn t praise those dictatorships and compare them favorably to democratic regimes there are however enough parallels between u s tariff policy in the 1920s and trumpism today for us to have a pretty good picture of what happens when politicians think that tariffs are beautiful and it s ugly

by patrick watson the logic of donald trump s multi front trade war if there is any is increasingly obscure the tangled mix of policies isn t accomplishing its stated goals and seems unlikely to ever do so meanwhile it hurts the americans it should supposedly help regardless it s happening and it has consequences none of them good the president s latest move to impose escalating tariffs on imports from mexico is the trade equivalent of going nuclear judging by his tweets trump thinks it will solve multiple problems trade drugs immigration and crime that s doubtful at best but as with real nuclear weapons the blast wave isn t going to discriminate it will hit everyone if you think the trade war hasn t affected you yet brace yourself you re about to feel it photo nick youngson alpha stock images tariffs raise prices a tariff is a form of sales tax on imported goods the importer has to give the government cash then recover it by charging more when it resells the goods accepting lower profit margins or some combination of both so far president trump s tariffs are showing up as higher inflation it s not obvious in the broad inflation measures like the consumer price index because only a few goods have been affected but in those segments the impact is clear goldman sachs recently compared price changes in nine tariff impacted cpi categories vs those that weren t since the first tariffs in 2018 an index of those categories rose more than 3 meanwhile all the other core goods categories showed a slight decline chart the daily shot this impact is about to spread the president is raising tariffs on almost all chinese goods and is threatening the same for mexico again we won t necessarily see this in retail prices right away but if we don t it will be only because merchants have stockpiled inventory or decided to absorb the cost out of their profits if it s the latter it s still not good companies with shrinking profit margins usually try to recover them somehow like laying off workers or postponing expansion plans consumers will certainly notice if the latest tariff increases persist more than a few months top retailers depend on chinese and mexican goods those prices will probably rise that might actually please the federal reserve which has been despondent over its inability to hit its 2 inflation target at some point they might raise interest rates to counter the inflation pressure but i think they ll let the economy run hot for a while first this might actually stimulate some activity as people try to avoid tariffs or find substitute goods but mostly we will see it as higher prices and lower disposable incomes but that will only be the beginning photo nick youngson alpha stock images damage ahead remember when politicians actually worried about government debt i know it s been awhile we used to think high debt would cause inflation that hasn t happened for reasons john mauldin explained recently in why debt won t spark inflation essentially debt fueled fiscal stimulus fades quickly to be replaced by weaker business conditions demand falls enough to keep consumer prices and interest rates from rising much if at all tariffs are similar in some ways president trump at least thinks he can make companies move production to the us and hire american workers thereby stimulating growth that may happen a little bit here and there but it won t be much the business leaders who make those decisions know full well that trump s unilateral tariffs may disappear when he leaves office or maybe sooner if he changes his mind few businesses are going to make major capital investments based on a whim that could change tomorrow so initially we will just get the higher prices in fairly short order though some us manufacturers will reduce output because the imported parts on which they depend are too expensive thanks to the tariffs and no alternate sources exist in the us laid off manufacturing workers will tighten their belts and reduce spending hitting the retail sector and possibly making some stores close those workers will lose their jobs too then the same will happen in the farm states as mexico and china shift their once large grain and meat purchases elsewhere by that point president trump may see the light and change his mind but the damage will be done business leaders will have seen what can happen their willingness to take risks and invest in new capacity will be lower then we may see some highly leveraged companies default on loans that never should have been made in the first place lenders will tighten standards and starve even viable companies of financing the fed may try to counteract this with rate cuts or qe but if we ve learned anything the last decade it s that monetary policy no longer has the same effects it used to all this adds up to one thing recession photo pixabay last straw now we are overdue for recession even without tariffs this historically weak growth cycle has to end eventually if tariffs don t trigger it something else will but tariffs could easily be the last straw this trade war could make the recession happen sooner last longer and cause more pain than it otherwise would what aggravates me most are the people saying we have to accept some pain in order to fix the problems with china first of all there is zero reason to think tariffs will solve the problems so we ll get more pain but little or no gain second those who so cavalierly want other americans to suffer tend to be wealthy powerful people they won t lose their jobs they have great health insurance and don t have to worry about foreclosure and bill collectors those who actually are suffering will notice that being the case this next recession could easily become more than a recession people in pain do radical things and those who caused that pain probably won t like where it leads patrick watson is senior economic analyst at mauldin economics this article is from a regular mauldin

unfortunately it seems that in terms of economic data south africa s 2019 film has begun in much the same vein as 2018 and could easily be classified within the horror genre given heightened fears that south africa could once again enter a technical recession in the first half of the year according to latest figures from statistics south africa the economy shrank by 3 2 quarter on quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised in the first quarter of 2019 the biggest plunge since the 2008 global financial crisis and the second highest drop seen in over two decades this decline was twice the number anticipated by general consensus and almost immediately saw the rand shed another 20 cents against the dollar touching r14 60 while bond yields rose by nearly 15bps growth year on year also remained flat at 0 unadjusted and means that the south african reserve bank and national treasury will likely need to revise their gdp growth expectations for 2019 downwards from around 1 3 to closer to 0 5 placing government s fiscal targets under significant strain this is not a good start to the year for ramaphosa s administration which continues to struggle with numerous legacy issues that have resulted from years of poor economic management and graft as long as economic growth remains at these kinds of mediocre levels government is not going to gain any real traction in resolving key challenges of inequality and unemployment and specifically youth unemployment government spending up key sectors down perhaps most notably the biggest positive contributor to economic growth was government 1 2 largely as a result of growth in civil service employment but while this spending made a positive contribution to gdp figures for the quarter it s not helping government s goal of reducing its expenses given our deteriorating fiscal situation there is evidently a great deal of work still ahead of ramaphosa s administration in terms of reducing headcount and making progress on the bloated public sector wage bill south africa simply can t rely on government to be one of the only three positive contributors to the gdp number if the country is to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth drought and load shedding pains the only two remaining positive contributors for the quarter were finance and personal services while all other sectors of the economy seemed to experience severe pain negatively impacted by a weak local and global environment and heightened load shedding construction 2 2 trade 3 6 transport 4 4 electricity 6 9 manufacturing 8 8 and mining 10 8 all exhibited weakness as expected while agriculture saw a substantial drop read eskom bailout risks moody s rating reserve bank says the latter is a notably small and volatile sector in the economy and the 13 2 decline largely reflects the consequences of the drought especially in the western cape but also signals a warning that many farmers are planting less as uncertainty around land weighs on the industry in terms of the expenditure side of the economy government is the sole contributor with expenditure rising by 1 3 consumers spending less meanwhile the 0 8 decline in household expenditure seen over the quarter is a clear indication that south african consumers are under severe pressure resulting from a combination of extremely high unemployment social grants which are not keeping up with inflation the increase in vat and higher fuel prices additionally the high number of upper income south africans emigrating would have represented a considerable drag on the spending ability of households in the country another worrying figure to emerge from the statistics was the 4 5 decline in gross fixed capital formation which implies that no new investments were made in the economy global woes significantly export figures declined 26 4 for the quarter signalling the extent to which the soft patch in the global environment is weighing upon the south african economy most emerging markets including south africa as well as to an extent developed markets such as the united states europe and japan have seen a decline in trade at the start of 2019 amidst slowing global growth this said fiscal stimulation in china and the us federal reserve placing interest rates on hold should create a more positive external environment in the global economy in the second half of the year which may help to support south africa s rebound from the low base line that has now been set ultimately however the global environment and external forces are slowly turning into headwinds rather than tailwinds which will make it more difficult for the local economy to finally turn the corner and achieve growth above 2

median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt

story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
unfortunately it seems that in terms of economic data south africa s 2019 film has begun in much the same vein as 2018 and could easily be classified within the horror genre given heightened fears that south africa could once again enter a technical recession in the first half of the year according to latest figures from statistics south africa the economy shrank by 3 2 quarter on quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised in the first quarter of 2019 the biggest plunge since the 2008 global financial crisis and the second highest drop seen in over two decades this decline was twice the number anticipated by general consensus and almost immediately saw the rand shed another 20 cents against the dollar touching r14 60 while bond yields rose by nearly 15bps growth year on year also remained flat at 0 unadjusted and means that the south african reserve bank and national treasury will likely need to revise their gdp growth expectations for 2019 downwards from around 1 3 to closer to 0 5 placing government s fiscal targets under significant strain this is not a good start to the year for ramaphosa s administration which continues to struggle with numerous legacy issues that have resulted from years of poor economic management and graft as long as economic growth remains at these kinds of mediocre levels government is not going to gain any real traction in resolving key challenges of inequality and unemployment and specifically youth unemployment government spending up key sectors down perhaps most notably the biggest positive contributor to economic growth was government 1 2 largely as a result of growth in civil service employment but while this spending made a positive contribution to gdp figures for the quarter it s not helping government s goal of reducing its expenses given our deteriorating fiscal situation there is evidently a great deal of work still ahead of ramaphosa s administration in terms of reducing headcount and making progress on the bloated public sector wage bill south africa simply can t rely on government to be one of the only three positive contributors to the gdp number if the country is to achieve inclusive and sustainable economic growth drought and load shedding pains the only two remaining positive contributors for the quarter were finance and personal services while all other sectors of the economy seemed to experience severe pain negatively impacted by a weak local and global environment and heightened load shedding construction 2 2 trade 3 6 transport 4 4 electricity 6 9 manufacturing 8 8 and mining 10 8 all exhibited weakness as expected while agriculture saw a substantial drop the latter is a notably small and volatile sector in the economy and the 13 2 decline largely reflects the consequences of the drought especially in the western cape but also signals a warning that many farmers are planting less as uncertainty around land weighs on the industry in terms of the expenditure side of the economy government is the sole contributor with expenditure rising by 1 3 consumers spending less meanwhile the 0 8 decline in household expenditure seen over the quarter is a clear indication that south african consumers are under severe pressure resulting from a combination of extremely high unemployment social grants which are not keeping up with inflation the increase in vat and higher fuel prices additionally the high number of upper income south africans emigrating would have represented a considerable drag on the spending ability of households in the country another worrying figure to emerge from the statistics was the 4 5 decline in gross fixed capital formation which implies that no new investments were made in the economy global woes significantly export figures declined 26 4 for the quarter signalling the extent to which the soft patch in the global environment is weighing upon the south african economy most emerging markets including south africa as well as to an extent developed markets such as the united states europe and japan have seen a decline in trade at the start of 2019 amidst slowing global growth this said fiscal stimulation in china and the us federal reserve placing interest rates on hold should create a more positive external environment in the global economy in the second half of the year which may help to support south africa s rebound from the low base line that has now been set ultimately however the global environment and external forces are slowly turning into headwinds rather than tailwinds which will make it more difficult for the local economy to finally turn the corner and achieve growth above 2 maarten ackerman is chief economist and advisory partner at citadel views expressed are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of fin24

file photo federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks with former chairman ben bernanke at a conference on monetary policy at the federal reserve bank of chicago by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s services sector activity expanded at a brisk pace in may and industries hired more workers offering some respite for an economy that is slowing following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventories in the first quarter the survey from the institute for supply management ism on wednesday followed a raft of weak reports on consumer spending housing and manufacturing that suggested a sharp loss of momentum in economic growth early in the second quarter slowing growth worsening trade tensions between the united states and china and looming u s tariffs on goods imported from mexico have led some economists to expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year the u s central bank early this year suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign fed chairman jerome powell on tuesday said the central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion though this won t completely dismiss the rate cut this year speculation the much better than expected nonmanufacturing ism print helps said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto the ism said its non manufacturing activity index rose 1 4 points to a reading of 56 9 in may a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity economists polled by reuters had forecast the index would be unchanged at 55 5 last month the may increase in services industry activity reflected a jump of 1 7 points in the production subindex activity was also boosted by gains in the new orders measure a gauge of services industry employment surged 4 4 points to a seven month high the ism said while businesses in the services sector were mostly optimistic about overall business conditions concerns remain about tariffs and employment resources president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing trump announced last week that he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico in a bid to stem the tide of illegal immigration across the u s mexican border the tariff would start at 5 on june 10 the ism said 16 industries including utilities real estate finance and insurance healthcare and social assistance information and professional scientific and technical services reported growth last month the only industry reporting contraction was agriculture forestry fishing and hunting businesses in the utilities industry said they were waiting to see the impact of chinese import tariff while their counterparts in the mining sector said because of the trade war it has been very difficult to plan in a long term ahead stocks on wall street were trading higher the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices rose fading stimulus the trade tensions and fading stimulus from the white house s tax cuts and spending increases are slamming the brakes on the economy the atlanta fed is forecasting gross domestic product to rise at a 1 3 annualised rate in the second quarter the economy grew at a 3 1 pace in the first quarter lifted by increases in exports inventories and defence spending goods exports fell sharply in april and the inventory overhang which is mostly concentrated in the auto sector is weighing on production at factories a separate report from the fed on wednesday showed tariffs continued to cause anxiety among businesses in its beige book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide the central bank described economic activity as expanding at a modest pace from april through mid may it said the outlook for the months ahead was solidly positive but modest last month s jump in hiring by services sector businesses suggested that a sharp slowdown in private payrolls growth in may shown in another report on wednesday was probably a fluke the adp national employment report showed private employers added only 27 000 jobs in may the fewest since march 2010 after creating 271 000 positions in april the adp figures came ahead of the labour department s more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on friday which includes both public and private sector employment the adp report which is jointly developed with moody s analytics has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s employment report economists polled by reuters are forecasting nonfarm payrolls to have increased 185 000 in may the unemployment rate is seen unchanged at 3 6 percent our hunch is that the drop off in adp s estimate of private payrolls growth is likely a blip said roiana reid an economist at berenberg capital markets in new york if the may employment report also exhibits similar weakness that would provide a more forceful indication that companies are scaling back hiring because of concerns about the economic outlook according to the adp report employment in the goods producing sector fell by 43 000 jobs in may the first drop in nearly 2 1 2 years manufacturing payrolls decreased 3 000 and construction shed 36 000 positions the most since 2010 the services sector added 71 000 jobs last month concentrated in professional and education and health services
