background foreign investment what is the prevailing attitude towards foreign investment foreign direct investment fdi in the united states represents an essential aspect of the us economy and the us government strives to create favourable conditions to maintain its status as one of the leading global recipients of it the united states has historically been a leader in negotiating and entering into numerous international investment treaties free trade agreements ftas and double taxation treaties to promote foreign investment and has many initiatives from local government to national levels designed to preserve and enhance the united states position as a top investment destination to that end the united states has adopted a model bilateral investment treaty bit that is utilised by many countries as a standard for treaty negotiations and also has entered various multilateral investment treaties including the north american free trade agreement nafta and the dominican republic and central american free trade agreement cafta which was modelled on nafta but with some important variations the election in november 2016 of donald j trump as the 45th president of the united states has led to some apparent shifts in us policy with respect to international trade agreements both during his campaign and since taking office president trump has criticised the effect of international trade agreements on american workers and the united states trade deficit president trump has withdrawn threatened to withdraw from or attempted to renegotiate various trade agreements to which the united states is a party for instance on 23 january 2017 only three days after taking office president trump withdrew the united states from a landmark new free trade agreement with 11 pacific rim nations the trans pacific partnership tpp which was then awaiting congressional approval an important foreign policy objective of the obama administration the tpp which was signed by the us in february 2016 but had not yet been approved by congress was aimed at reducing tariffs and liberalising trade among the member states the trading block covered by the agreement would have encompassed 40 per cent of global gdp following us withdrawal the remaining nations signed but have not yet ratified a revised version of the tpp called the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp although no formal decisions have been taken early in 2018 president trump reportedly requested his trade team to analyse the possibility of joining the cptpp the trump administration has also engaged in renegotiations of nafta with mexico and canada and the bilateral trade agreement with south korea after at first threatening to unilaterally terminate the agreements altogether the trump administration has also suspended negotiations with the european union for a comprehensive trade and investment agreement known as ttip regarding nafta in august 2018 the white house informed congress that the united states and mexico had reached a preliminary agreement to modernise the treaty following this announcement president trump threatened to exclude canada from the new deal despite the opposition of legislators however the united states and canada resumed their negotiations and on 30 september 2018 the trump administration announced that the countries two governments had struck a deal to modify nafta this would allow canada to join the preliminary agreement reached in august between the united states and mexico as of early october 2018 if the new treaty is ratified by its parties the new three country pact will be called the united states mexico canada agreement usmca and it will present significant changes in the investor state dispute settlement regime compared to the current nafta notwithstanding the uncertainty arising over these various trade agreements as of 2018 the united states nonetheless remained the world s largest recipient of foreign direct investment and various initiatives remain in place to encourage foreign investment into the country and the united states trade and investment policies even if shifting in comparison to historical approaches will continue to foster international commercial activity with its largest trading partners what are the main sectors for foreign investment in the state foreign direct investment in the united states spans a wide spectrum of industry sectors at over one third of total fdi in the united states economy the manufacturing sector continues to attract the largest percentage of total inward fdi flows the united states also attracts large fdi investments in various other sectors notably wholesale and retail trade information industries banking finance and insurance real estate and scientific industries and technical and professional services is there a net inflow or outflow of foreign direct investment the united states remains the largest recipient of global fdi in 2017 fdi inflows to the us totalled us 275 billion down from us 457 billion in 2016 2017 net outflows exceeded net inflows with a total of us 342 billion the decline in net inflows is explained by united nations conference on trade and development unctad as a general phenomenon that occurred in the 2016 17 period where fdi inflows declined in developed countries by 37 per cent according to unctad the cause of this fall relates in large part by a decline from high inflows in the preceding year caused by cross border mergers and acquisitions and corporate reconfigurations

state or state owned entities there are no requirements over the form of contracts particular to foreign investors in the united states whether contracting with the government or with private parties

through existing agreements such as modern treaties of friendship commerce navigation or ftas to encourage the adoption of market oriented domestic policies that treat private investment in an open transparent and non discriminatory way and to support the development of international law standards consistent with these objectives as discussed in question 17 us bits are negotiated by

in the united states including grants loans loan guarantees and tax incentives and provides industry and regional snapshots that describe the competitive landscape see the selectusa academy also provides an online and on site training programme for investors and has been improving its online investment tools that assist companies in identifying state based incentives so that foreign investors can make more informed decisions as to where to target investments within the united states in 2016 at the selectusa investment summit the creation of a new fdi advisory council was announced whose membership which includes representatives of us companies entities and organisations with missions or activities that include the promotion or facilitation of fdi will serve as a key conduit for

laws identify the domestic laws that apply to foreign investors and foreign investment including any requirements of admission or registration of investments for the most part us law treats foreign owned businesses identically to us owned businesses and state laws impacting fdi are not implemented as they would be pre empted by the federal congressional and executive prerogatives to legislate within this sphere there are no economic sectors restricted to us nationals or requiring specific holdings based on nationality there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate and there are no exchange control or currency regulations affecting foreign investment generally there are relatively few hurdles that need to be cleared in order to incorporate and register a business in the united states although this varies from state to state for example in delaware one of the leading sites for business incorporation only the following steps must be completed choose a business entity type obtain a registered agent in the state of delaware reserve your entity name complete a certificate of incorporation and request a certificate of status or good standing for certain financial institution requirements see www corp delaware gov howtoform shtml certain foreign investments however are subject to governmental review for potential national security implications pursuant to the exon florio amendment to the defense production act of 1950 as amended the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius is authorised to review foreign investments in us businesses for potential effects on national security although the cfius rarely suspends or blocks foreign investment activity it is nevertheless empowered to require foreign investors to agree to various measures designed to mitigate national security concerns such as notification obligations relating to changes in products or services and the establishment of internal compliance monitoring measures there are indications that under president trump cfius has been scrutinising investments from the people s republic of china with greater rigour especially investments in the technology sector further foreign investors in united states entities are of course subject to the full panoply of domestic business antitrust securities tax and other legislation governing domestic entities and when contracting with government agencies any relevant state or federal procurement laws or regulations relevant regulatory agency identify the state agency that regulates and promotes inbound foreign investment the us department of commerce as well as a wide spectrum of regional state and local economic development organisations and chambers of commerce work actively and often in coordination to promote inward fdi again state laws impacting foreign direct investment are not implemented as they are pre empted by the federal congressional and executive prerogatives to legislate within this sphere responsibility for the scrutiny of potential foreign investments for national security concerns resides with the cfius an interagency committee chaired by the us treasury relevant dispute agency identify the state agency that must be served with process in a dispute with a foreign investor in investment treaty disputes with the united states or its agencies and instrumentalities the procedures for proper notice

on the united states by delivery to the executive director within the office of the legal adviser at the united states department of state in washington dc to the extent that a foreign investor brings an action against the united states in the us courts the requirements for process will be found in the relevant rules of procedure specifically federal rule of civil procedure 4 provides that service

cases the state department works closely with other governmental agencies to develop united states government positions in these cases the united states has defended all claims brought against it enforcement of awards against the state enforcement agreements is the state party to any international agreements regarding enforcement such as the 1958 un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the united states is party to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention in force since december 1970 and the 1975 inter american convention on international commercial arbitration panama convention in force since october 1990 a similar regional treaty among certain members of the organization of american states the new york and panama conventions are codified into us law pursuant to chapters 2 and 3 of the united states federal arbitration act faa 1925 9 usc section 201 et seq the united states has attached what is commonly termed the reciprocity reservation to its ratification of the new york and panama conventions such that the united states will apply those conventions only to the recognition and enforcement of awards made in the territory of another contracting state the united states ratification of the new york convention is also subject to the reservation that it will apply it only to differences arising out of legal relationships of a commercial nature the united states is also a party to the icsid convention award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment treaty awards rendered against it to date no investment treaty awards have been rendered against the united states but the united states has encouraged other countries to comply with investment treaty awards that have been entered against them and in a notable example suspended preferential trade preferences granted to argentina for failing to comply with such awards this suggests that the united states would voluntarily comply with an investment treaty award validly entered against it unfavourable awards if not does the state appeal to its domestic courts or the courts where the arbitration was seated against unfavourable awards the united states has not been subject to any unfavourable merits awards to date provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory the enforcement of non icsid international arbitral awards in the united states is governed by the new york and panama conventions and the faa 9 usc section 1 et seq which gives effect to and implements the conventions the faa and federal and state law express a strong presumption that international arbitration awards subject to the conventions will be confirmed under section 10 a of the faa an award made in the united states may only be vacated on the following limited grounds where the award was procured by corruption fraud or undue means where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehaviour by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or where the arbitrators exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made some us courts have vacated awards on the additional ground that the tribunal manifestly disregarded the law those courts that have employed this ground however have used it sparingly and generally only in instances where law to be applied was crystal clear and clearly ignored for international arbitral awards rendered outside the united states recognition or enforcement may be refused only on the similar and similarly narrow grounds set forth in article v of the new york and panama conventions which are absence of a valid arbitration agreement article v 1 a denial of the opportunity to present one s case article v 1 b excess of authority article v 1 c violations of arbitral procedures or the law of the arbitral situs article v 1 d awards that are not yet binding or have been set aside article v 1 e awards that address non arbitrable issues article v 2 a and awards that violate public policy article v 2 b although unlike the faa grounds for vacatur the conventions contain an express public policy ground for non recognition us courts have rejected an expansive reading of the public policy defence and have tended to deny enforcement of awards on that basis only where enforcement would have violated the forum state s most basic notions of morality and justice eg parsons and whitmore overseas co v societe generale de l industrie du papier 508 f2d 969 974 2d cir 1974 while there are only limited and narrowly construed bases for vacating or denying recognition of arbitral awards under the faa and the conventions us courts guided by the us supreme court s january 2014 decision in daimler v bauman will require that the party seeking enforcement of an international arbitral award establish personal jurisdiction over a judgment debtor the daimler decision recently informed a decision of the us court of appeals for the second circuit to refuse enforcement of an international chamber of commerce award on the basis that the turkish award debtor did not have a sufficient connection with the state of new york for the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over it see sonera holding bv v cukurova holdings as 750 f3d 221 2d cir 2014 separate procedures apply to the recognition and enforcement of icsid awards although icsid awards are not subject to ordinary judicial challenge they still must be brought to a national court for recognition and enforcement if the losing party refuses to voluntarily comply article 54 of the icsid convention requires national courts of the contracting states to recognise an award rendered pursuant to this convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that state the united states enabling legislation for the icsid convention 22 usc section 1650a provides that the united states federal courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction over actions to enforce icsid awards and clarifies that the grounds for vacatur or non recognition set forth in the faa shall not apply to icsid convention awards where a judgment debtor is a sovereign article 55 of the icsid convention provides that othing in article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any contracting state relating to immunity of that state or of any foreign state from execution this article is generally perceived to relate to the execution rather than the judicial recognition phase because the united states has never lost an investment arbitration there is accordingly no case law in the united states directly addressing possible enforcement of a treaty award against the united states under any of the above conventions the authors would like to thank quinn emanuel associate manuel valderrama for his assistance with this chapter update and trends current developments are there any emerging trends or hot topics in your jurisdiction since the end of the second world war the united states has been at the forefront of free trade and economic globalisation presidents of both political parties are responsible for creating the global free trade architecture that exists today including the wto and nafta the election of donald j trump as president however ushered in a significant policy shift echoing his campaign themes in his address to the united nations on 18 september 2017 for instance president trump criticised multinational trade deals unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies and his administration has taken a number of concrete steps to withdraw from or re negotiate key multilateral and bilateral trade agreements for example in january 2017 president trump withdrew the united states from the tpp which had been signed by the united states and 11 other pacific rim countries during the obama presidency following the withdrawal of the united states the remaining signatories entered into a revised agreement called the cptpp this new agreement contains most of the provisions of the now defunct tpp but revised those that were a priority to the united states nevertheless president trump has reportedly instructed his international trade team to look into the possibility of the united states negotiating individual bits with tpp signatories additionally president trump recently announced that the united states had reached an agreement with mexico and canada to sign the usmca in place of nafta if ratified as proposed the new agreement would carry with it some significant alterations to the nafta investor protection regime for instance the usmca would eliminate the investor state arbitration regime between canada and mexico and canada and the united states regarding the united states mexico regime the isds mechanism would also be largely modified most investors would have neither protection against indirect expropriation fet treatment nor for pre investment activities in turn claims based on direct expropriation and the obligations to provide national treatment and mfn treatment during the course of the investment would remain available under the proposed usmca before filing an arbitration claim most investors would need to exhaust claims before local courts or pursue them for a minimum of 30 months unless otherwise futile in addition claimants would need to give host states a 90 day notice period before submitting a claim to arbitration notably however some categories of investments would continue to have substantially the same protections as in nafta the proposed usmca specifically states that covered sectors including oil and natural gas and power generation services with regard to covered government contracts would still be able to assert claims alleging indirect expropriation and violations of fet additionally these claimants would not need to pursue local remedies finally the proposed usmca text as of october 2018 notes that pending arbitration claims brought under nafta would not be affected by the new agreement in addition the usmca clarifies that legacy investments that is investments made under nafta would continue to be governed by the dispute settlement provisions and the protections of nafta for a three year period thus investors may continue to bring claims relating to legacy investments as long as they are brought within three years following nafta s termination further president trump has also asked south korea to renegotiate its bilateral fta with the united states the two countries reached an agreement on march 2018 the renegotiated agreement addresses a number of regulatory and implementation areas especially concerning automobile exports in addition to the above efforts to withdraw from or renegotiate various bilateral and multilateral trade agreements since early 2018 the trump administration has imposed a series of new tariffs on various products that have led to highly contentious and continuing trade disputes with many of the united states leading trading partners with the stated objectives of enhancing national security and protecting american jobs and industry by abating the flood of cheap chinese steel on the world market the united states has implemented a number of restrictions on aluminum and steel imports against china as well as against many other countries including major us allies in europe and north america the trump administration has also imposed high tariffs against china up to 25 per cent on a variety of other goods such as fish petroleum and chemicals in turn china has announced its own tariffs on us imports ranging from 15 per cent to 25 per cent on goods ranging from steel pipes to pork this has translated into a back and forth trade war between the two countries with no foreseeable end as of october 2018 in addition president trump has threatened to withdraw the united states from the wto alleging that it treats the united states unfairly in disputes before the organisation a new bill with this effect has allegedly been drafted but not delivered to congress on the other hand on 7 september 2018 president trump announced that he has started trade talks for an fta with japan in other trends the united states remains a prominent jurisdiction for actions to enforce investment awards including against sovereign debtors federal courts in the united states have demonstrated a lack of receptiveness to both procedural and tactical defenses to enforcement based on sovereign immunity the standing of third party assignees of award creditors and res judicata or statute of limitations defenses the new york federal courts were at the nexus of efforts of foreign bondholders to recover against argentina in actions resulting from its 2001 debt crisis and default while many of argentina s creditors accepted substantial haircuts on their investments during the 2005 and 2010 bond swaps the exchange creditors in recent years the new york federal courts have issued a string of decisions favoring holdout creditors including decisions barring argentina from paying exchange and other creditors before the holdouts most of the lawsuits against argentina in the new york courts ended in the spring of 2016 through landmark cash settlements with the major litigants at the same time a new york federal judge vacated a series of injunctions that had prevented argentina from paying the exchange creditors and thereby paving the way for argentina s renewed entry into the global financial markets lately two decisions issued by european authorities have raised alarms in the international investment arbitration community which may cause reverberations within the united states first the european commission s decision regarding support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources cogeneration and waste and second the european court of justice ruling in achmea following these two decisions european investors will likely face difficulties in enforcing intra eu investment arbitration awards within the european union and may turn to non eu courts to do so in this sense us courts are arguably a safe forum for investors indeed american courts are not bound to accord supremacy to eu law and instead would be required to give legal effect to arbitral awards pursuant to treaties to which the united states is a party namely the icsid convention and the new york convention to date the micula case is the only known us case that addresses the potential conflicts in enforcing an intra eu arbitral award the micula brothers petitioned the southern district of new york to recognise and enforce an award obtained against romania the european commission ec had taken an active part in opposing the petition however the district court rejected the ec s arguments and converted the icsid award into a judgement the court held that courts in the united states have a compelling interest in fulfilling obligation under article 54 to recognize and enforce icsid awards regardless of the actions of another state micula v gov t of romania no 15 misc 107 2015 wl 4643180 at 7 sdny 5 august 2015 rev d on other grounds no 15 3109 cv 2017 wl 4772435 2d cir 23 october 2017 although the district court decision was reversed on the grounds that a foreign sovereign immunities act complaint suit was required the rejection of the ec s arguments was left intact therefore the compelling interest in upholding the icsid convention highlighted by the us district court should trump any future concern over a legal conflict with a foreign law that the united states is not bound to follow
necessity proportionality and probity central bank independence in unconventional times speech by yves mersch member of the executive board of the ecb at the ecb and its watchers xx conference frankfurt am main 27 march 2019 introduction the benefits of central bank independence have been established and demonstrated time and again inflation is costly history shows that governments lack the credibility to commit to time consistent monetary policy and often subordinate it to other priorities faced with elections governments are tempted to boost short term growth by stoking unexpected inflation but in the long run this just raises inflation expectations without any benefit to growth by delegating monetary policy to an independent accountable central bank with a narrow mandate for price stability democracies have found a way to reduce costly inflation without incurring output losses over the medium term despite this successful track record or perhaps because of it central bank independence has been recently questioned in particular it is argued that central bank independence is only justified if distributional effects are comparatively small critics claim that unconventional measures have large distributional effects across households industrial sectors and even countries and thus stray into the realms of economic and fiscal policy this debate has led to a wealth of academic literature being published on the ideal conditions for delegating powers and coordination between policies to be clear from the outset it is the task of safeguarding the purchasing power of the currency that requires shelter from political influence the same degree of independence is not necessarily justified for other policy areas entrusted to central banks that lie beyond this mandate that is why i have repeatedly encouraged a functional approach to the concept of independence given my audience today i will not discuss microprudential supervision or financial stability considerations instead i will focus on practical advice on how we should act in the current environment to best achieve our primary mandate and preserve independence independence that remains necessary to ensure long run price stability in this vein i believe there are three watchwords that should guide our actions necessity proportionality and probity as several judicial reviews have confirmed necessity to put these watchwords in context let me recall the economic conditions at the time the ecb decided to implement unconventional measures the euro area economy had undergone a double dip recession inflation outcomes flirted with deflation and there were signs that inflation expectations were becoming de anchored the transmission of monetary policy across the whole euro area was impaired fiscal policy offered little by way of countercyclical stabilisation traditional monetary policy had reached its limits with nominal interest rates close to zero and some contemporary measures of real equilibrium interest rates below zero the choice for the ecb at the time was stark we could either restrict ourselves to conventional monetary policy and fail to fulfil our price stability mandate or we could implement unconventional measures and respect our mandate i would argue that there was no real choice the treaty affords us broad discretion in our choice of tools to honour our price stability mandate but it offers no discretion whatsoever in the choice of whether or not we fulfil that mandate these are the only conditions under which central bank independence is sustainable that is the essence of my first watchword necessity by carrying out monetary policy using a range of additional tools that were legally available to us and used successfully by other central banks in advanced economies the ecb supported the recovery and helped ensure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation we would not have managed this without unconventional measures i do not believe that central bank independence is sustainable if unelected bureaucrats refuse to take the actions necessary to honour their legal mandate it is true that some of these tools have been unpopular but central banks are no strangers to unpopularity indeed if acting in the best interests of long term prosperity were always popular monetary policy could safely be left in the hands of politicians proportionality but does necessity mean that all actions are justified when pursuing our price stability mandate the short answer is no policymakers need to take into account not just the impact their tools have for their primary purpose but also any potential side effects policy needs to maintain proportionality my second watchword for today proportionality is one of the basic legal principles of the architecture of the european union it is enshrined in the foundational treaties and demands that the content and form of union action should not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the treaties for monetary policy proportionality implies that the ecb s actions must first be suitable to address the identified risks to price stability second the ecb s measures must be necessary to achieve their intended objective in other words alternative monetary policy measures that entail more limited action would not enable the objective to be achieved as effectively and rapidly third proportionality stricto sensu implies that the expected benefits of the ecb s actions must outweigh their costs these principles provide for a hierarchy of tools where unconventional measures should be used only once conventional measures have been exhausted let me address then the criticism that the distributional consequences of unconventional monetary policy undermine central bank independence it is worth recalling that monetary policy always has distributional effects cutting short term interest rates tends to reduce the income of savers and boost the income of debtors and the wealth of asset holders it also affects incomes through the macroeconomic effects on employment and wages in short not only does conventional monetary policy have distributional effects it partly works through causing them in normal times these effects are viewed as being of secondary importance to the aggregate welfare benefits of price stability in other words they are proportionate moreover any distributional consequences of monetary policy action need to be set against the distributional consequences of inaction sudden unexpected deflation has distributional consequences ten million more people are now employed in the euro area than when unemployment peaked this number would be much smaller had the ecb not acted even though we only have a narrow mandate to maintain price stability that does not cover employment the ecb also attempted to minimise unwanted side effects by carefully designing our tools for example it became clear that our asset purchase programme app was contributing to challenging conditions in the repo market by the end of 2016 around half of german government bonds were trading special that is at a premium to general collateral we modified our securities lending programme including by accepting cash as collateral to mitigate the impact of the app on repo markets today the share of specials is generally below 10 in general prevention is better than cure that s why we established many safeguards and restrictions particularly in our public sector purchase programme to avoid interfering with fiscal and economic policy and providing monetary financing to governments the stringent eligibility criteria and issue and issuer limits are examples of self imposed restrictions which have been vetted by the european court of justice independence and the prohibition of monetary financing prevent central banks from behaving as a fiscal substitute we have also increased transparency and enhanced accountability measures the necessary counterparts of independence notably this includes publishing the accounts of the monetary policy discussion in the governing council the takeover of banking supervision was accompanied by additional and more far reaching accountability obligations such as the interinstitutional agreement with the european parliament and a number of memoranda of understanding with other institutions a separation principle was established and supervision does not have broad regulatory powers like in monetary policy so while our unconventional measures undoubtedly have side effects the essential point is that these side effects are not manifestly disproportionate to the primary objective of the measures contributing to price stability but we have to continuously monitor the ongoing appropriateness of our measures in order to preserve the balance between costs and benefits and while the growing number of new tools and activities has moved the actions of the central bank closer to other policy realms the boundary was never crossed as confirmed by the european court of justice therefore the use of such measures during the crisis does not represent a break with the framework that justifies central bank independence but we continue to assess the impact of our measures and of negative interest rates in particular on areas such as bank profitability and to consider whether our mix of policy measures remains suitable and proportionate probity my final watchword refers not to how policymakers conduct policy but to their personal conduct at a time of increased external pressure on central banks it is important that policymakers act with probity the treaty affords significant personal independence to members of the ecb s governing council these provisions play a vital role in our unique institutional framework since monetary policy must be appropriate for euro area wide conditions which may be different from the conditions in a policymaker s home country by providing strong protections for sitting governing council members the treaty aims to isolate them from political pressure these protections also come with an obligation to act in a responsible manner at all times inappropriate behaviour by policymakers can damage the reputation of central banks and be used by politicians to build a narrative against independence this is why we publish the calendars of the members of the executive board as well as their speaking points when talking behind closed doors in the long run we can only remain isolated from political pressure if we separate ourselves from political debate conclusion the multiple crises of recent years have forced the ecb to venture into unknown territory to fulfil its primary mandate undesirable but unavoidable side effects of monetary policy measures and the expansion of our activities into the vicinity of other policy areas have led to attacks on the ecb s independence although the highest court confirmed that the unconventional measures taken by the ecb were legal the subjective albeit erroneous impression of a breach of mandate has been enough to trigger increased political pressure the best protection against unjustified attacks on the independence of monetary policy is therefore a narrower mandate combined with a high degree of transparency and the strict interpretation of legal limits in this respect a broader mandate in some jurisdictions warrants a clear distinction between government tasks and ancillary central bank tasks as to supervision operational autonomy is of the essence but of a nature that is functionally determined monetary policy independence extends indeed to a broader regulation power and a role as guardian of the treaty for monetary policy this does not mean however that we will inevitably and over hastily return to the limited set of instruments and the balance sheet size of the pre crisis period regulatory changes and the enduring fragmentation of european financial markets may in the future require some adjustments to our operational framework for monetary policy within our well established strategy however whatever a future monetary policy framework may look like it must be based exclusively on the price stability mandate and set up within legal limits

our total revenues in bolivia decreased slightly for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 total service revenues declined by 2 3 million or 4 due primarily to lower voice revenues which were partially offset by higher data revenues the decline in service revenues was offset by an increase in equipment revenues as a result of a new handset financing program available to certain postpaid customers as of december 31 2018 lte adoption increased to 739 thousand subscribers and now represents 38 of the mobile subscriber base compared to 20 as of the prior year end continued strong growth of lte users has been the primary driver for the overall increase in data consumption however competitive pressure in the market has resulted in reduced data pricing that more than offset the positive impact of growth in data consumption adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in bolivia decreased 13 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the decrease in total revenues coupled with a 1 0 million increase in operating expenses largely due to the following cost of service decreased by 1 0 million or 4 primarily due to reduced voice and sms interconnection costs coupled with lower site maintenance costs relating to renegotiation of maintenance and support contracts sales and marketing increased by 0 7 million or 8 due to an increase in advertising and promotions costs in connection with new promotions launched during the quarter and general and administrative expenses increased by 0 8 million or 9 due primarily to a government mandated bonus triggered when bolivia s annual gdp exceeds the stated target cost of equipment sales increased by 0 8 million or 30 primarily due to an increase in device sales during the fourth quarter of 2018 capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased 12 5 million or 63 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the timing of lte

twelve months ended december 31 2018 respectively compared to the same periods in 2017 this increase was primarily driven by a 4 5 million fine in bolivia accrued in september 2018 related to a network outage that occurred in 2015 for additional information see note 16 commitments and contingences to the company s consolidated financial statements managing our liquidity and financial resources as of december 31 2018 the company had approximately 43 9 million in cash and cash equivalents of which 12 1 million was held by 2degrees 27 0 million was held by nuevatel and 4 8 million

facility in new zealand as of december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents decreased 3 2 million since december 31 2017 primarily driven by purchase of property and equipment in 2018 partially offset by inflows provided by the ongoing operations of the business in november 2019 the license for 30 mhz of nuevatel s 1900 mhz spectrum holdings will expire nuevatel expects to renew the license and estimates that a payment of approximately 25 million will be due in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the expiration the payment is expected to be funded with cash resources from a combination of nuevatel s operating cash flows changes in the timing of property and equipment purchases and from the proceeds of the sale and leaseback of certain nuevatel network tower assets described below in december 2018 nuevatel entered into an 8 0 million debt facility with banco nacional de bolivia s a nuevatel drew down the 8 0 million debt facility in two 4 0 million advances that occurred in december 2018 and january 2019 in february 2019 nuevatel entered into an agreement to sell approximately 600 of nuevatel s towers to a bolivian subsidiary of phoenix tower international pti for expected cash proceeds of approximately 100 million the transaction will close in stages as conditions to close are satisfied for the towers the initial closing was completed in february 2019 for 400 towers and resulted in cash consideration of approximately 65 million we expect to complete the remainder of the closings during 2019 the towers subject to the transaction will be leased back to

december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 this change was mainly due to a 17 9 million reduction in interest paid net of capitalized interest due to a partial repayment in february 2017 and the refinancing in may 2017 of the trilogy 2019 notes this change was partially offset by an increase in eip receivables driven by a higher volume of eip receivables added in 2018 as compared to 2017 investing activities cash flow used in investing activities decreased by 57 7 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 this decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of short term investments and an increase in maturities and sales of short term investments in 2018 further spending for capital expenditures in bolivia in 2018 was lower due to the timing of 4g lte investments in 2018 financing activities cash flow used in financing activities increased by 95 8 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 this change

in the first quarter of 2019 whereby operating expenses will increase by approximately 8 million on an annualized basis additionally it is expected that the competitive conditions of the fourth quarter of 2018 will persist through 2019 consolidated capital expenditures for the full year 2019 are expected to be substantially consistent with 2018 on an absolute dollar basis in addition to our guidance of baseline consolidated capital expenditures the company may also evaluate incremental uses of capital such incremental projects may include strategic initiatives such as additional national roaming network build in new zealand and fixed lte investment in bolivia which are expected to be partially funded with available borrowing capacity in both markets in addition to the aforementioned capital expenditures bolivia expects to make a payment of approximately 25 million for spectrum renewal in 2019 the above table outlines guidance ranges for selected full year 2019 consolidated

measures and other financial measures basis of presentation in managing our business and assessing our financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements presented in accordance with gaap with several customer focused performance metrics and non gaap financial measures which are utilized by our management to evaluate our performance although we believe these measures are widely used in the wireless industry some may not be defined by us in precisely the same way as by other companies in the wireless industry so there may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies adjusted ebitda represents net loss the most directly comparable gaap measure excluding amounts for income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization and accretion equity based compensation recorded as a component of general and administrative expense gain loss on disposal and abandonment of assets and all other non operating income and expenses adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are common measures of operating performance in the telecommunications industry we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful measures because they allow us to evaluate our performance by removing from our operating results items that do not relate to our core operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss

china s slowdown and trade uncertainties combine with domestic turbulence to make 2019 a year of low expectations for latin america china s slowdown and trade uncertainties combine with domestic turbulence to make 2019 a year of low expectations for latin america latin american economies face a tough year in 2019 a struggle to overcome hurdles created by china s slowdown meanwhile the region s own social and fiscal issues are exacting a high price most especially on venezuela some governments promise bold responses but along profoundly different lines gdp for all of latin america should grow 2 this year and 2 5 in 2020 according to the latest projections from the international monetary fund imf that would place performance below expected world growth of 3 5 and 3 6 respectively the region s two biggest economies brazil and mexico are both wrestling with structural inbalances and both have new governments moving in ideologically opposite directions from their predecessors argentina the third major latin american economy is facing its second year of deep recession under a package of unpopular fiscal and monetary measures latin america is very sensitive to the world economy whose slowdown this year will increase the volatility and the uncertainty in the financial sector says daniel titelman chief of the economic development division of the un economic commission for latin america and the caribbean ecalc concerns over policy direction are adding to concerns the weakening of world activity and the uncertainty on economic policies are making their contributions to the slower pace of latin american growth says alejandro werner director of the western hemisphere department at the imf the crisis in venezuela risks dragging other countries in the region into a protracted struggle over political and resource control a silver lining thus far has been the andean economies without which the whole region could look forward to an even slower pace of growth neither will they shine however chile and peru both huge mineral commodities exporters are expected to suffer directly from the chinese slowdown peru s economy should grow 4 1 this year according to the imf with the same projected for 2020 chile is expected to expand 3 4 around 0 6 percentage points below the rate it registered last year even facing hard fiscal adjustments and battles against guerrillas colombia should produce higher growth 3 6 in 2019 up from 2 8 last year due to a construction sector recovery and a tax cut in december mexico apprehensions of amlo moving north latin america s second largest economy is embracing the nationalist and populist vision of its new leftist president andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo he is sticking with the antibusiness rhetoric he employed during his electoral campaign he has promised to tear up the reforms enacted during the last administration especially the opening of mexico s oil industry and the old goal of fiscal primary result of 1 of the gdp in 2019 both initiatives are scaring investors given these uncertainties the imf has revised its estimate for mexican gdp growthto 2 from 2 1 last october even that may be erring too far in a positive direction some analysts say the services sector would be a huge source of growth but it has reduced its pace during the last one and a half years says marco oviedo head of latin america economics research at barclays underlining the government s lack of attention to segments with high growth potential the estimate of 2 gdp growth this year is optimistic it is possible that the country will reach only 1 5 an expected drop in oil production threatens additional downward pressure a consequence of the government s failure to invest in pemex and uncertainty regarding approval of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the rewrite of nafta by the us congress on the positive side mexico can profit from its openness to chinese electronic investors its automobile exports to europe and tourism oviedo adds vigorous bank lending could spur faster growth but to play that role the banking system would require reform right now ovideo says banks are reluctant to boost lending having been spooked by the 1990s banking crisis total outstanding debt in mexico corresponds to 25 of gdp according to oviedo while in chile it equals 50 mexico is open to the entrance of foreign banks but the risk perception is still high with the banks serving only a narrow customer base most borrowers resort to the sofomes mexico s network of some 1 400 multipurpose often unregulated financial lenders which charge higher interest rates yet the new administration is showing no signs of pushing reforms that would give lower income individuals and small businesses greater access to the mainstream banking system oviedo says brazil focusing on pension reform under its new president jair bolsonaro the first far right chief of state since the military dictatorship that ended in 1985 brazil appears set for another year of low gdp growth for 2019 both the imf and eclac estimate expansion of 2 5 better than the 1 3 the country achieved in 2018 but still below potential titelman cites low inflation and rising public and private investments as key factors pointing to improvement in 2019 economists as well as investors are watching closely the progress of pension reform which many regard as key to brazil s economic fortunes reducing pension payouts is an unpopular objective that one government after another has postponed for the last 20 years while public debt and deficits have increased bolsonaro has pledged to support pension reductions but no one can be sure how the new congress fragmented into 27 political parties will vote the imf and eclac growth estimates may come through even if pension austerity doesn t some argue it is not enough for huge optimism but this 2 growth will happen even if pension reform is not approved says titelman the pension reform implementation market openness and a privatization plan all promised by the government can improve the growth rate even more this or next year but they are not yet guaranteed sérgio valle chief economist at mb associados anticipates that if pension reform is approved bolsonaro s administration will have the chance to move on to tax reform which is demanded by industry otherwise this will be difficult a gdp growth above 3 next year depends on pension reform approval with no reform the country is doomed to recession valle says there is no plan b the cost of the pension system to the public account is the highest in the world the new market oriented administration s agenda has its troubling elements bolsonaro s most radical ministers those responsible for foreign affairs education and human rights are promoting policies that could raise uncertainties for powerful productive sectors including agribusiness and lower the country s already poor educational standards nevertheless general motors has announced 10 billion reais 2 73 billion in investments in brazil from 2020 to 2024 to better position it to meet not only the growing demand in brazil but to better serve the entire mercosur customs union argentina wrenching recession brazil s mercosur partner argentina will endure negative growth of 1 6 this year according to imf and eclac projections following a 2 6 retraction in 2018 this second year of wrenching recession is the result in part of the fiscal and monetary austerity adopted under president mauricio macri argentina suffered a huge financial shock last year that has forced it to embrace macroeconomic changes and to ask the imf for help specifically a three year 57 billion bailout lending program titelman notes the country s economic outcome will improve from the second quarter of 2019 when household income should rise influenced by the agricultural harvest
background foreign investment what is the prevailing attitude towards foreign investment korea exhibits a positive and welcoming attitude towards foreign investment the government s creation of agencies and laws to promote and assist foreign investors and to streamline investment processes shows a clear attempt to attract more investments into the country the business environment encourages foreign investments and is welcoming towards investors for example specifically designated foreign investment zones free economic zones and free trade zones have been created by the korean government to foster investment and trade tax incentives are offered to foreign investors and the past 20 years have seen a liberalisation of the securities market with a lifting of regulatory ceilings on foreign investments in various markets and industries what are the main sectors for foreign investment in the state historically the manufacture of tangible goods was the main sector for foreign investment in korea including chemical goods manufacturing machine and equipment manufacturing transportation machinery and electrical or electronic goods production in recent years the intangible goods and services industries have increasingly attracted foreign investment and further growth is expected in the coming years based on the current figures banking and finance insurance real estate and business services research and development facilities logistics centres and regional headquarters of multinational corporations are the areas of particular note is there a net inflow or outflow of foreign direct investment during the past five years there has been a slight increase both in the annual amount of direct investments inbound and outbound nonetheless there has been a net outflow of foreign direct investments without great changes in any specific trend in the first quarter of 2018 the outflow was us 5 4 billion and the inflow was us 3 4 billion resulting in a net outflow of us 2 billion in 2017 the outflow was us 31 67 billion and the inflow was us 17 05 billion resulting in a net outflow of us 14 62 billion investment agreement legislation describe domestic legislation

investment treaties identify and give brief details of the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party also indicating whether they are in force korea s bilateral investment treaty programme is extensive with 88 treaties in force as of august 2018 also the agreement among the governments of the republic of korea rok china and japan for the promotion facilitation and protection of investment rok china japan investment protection agreement was executed and entered into force on 17 may 2014 the first ever economic agreement among the three countries has bolstered the institutional foundation for the promotion and protection of investment among them as such investors are now able to invoke the investment protection agreement of their choice for their benefit korea has also proceeded actively with the execution of free trade agreements as a means of policy implementation to encourage the continual growth of the korean economy and to become an advanced trading country free trade agreements ftas generally include provisions for the protection of investments between the contracting states and as such are broader instruments that also cover what bits often provide for in the way of investor protections the korean government adopted the fta road map for 2003 utilising it as a base from which to negotiate ftas with major economic partner countries as a result a total of 15 ftas with 52 contracting parties such as the association of southeast asian nations asean australia canada chile china the european free trade association the european union india peru singapore turkey and the united states were executed and have entered into force in february 2018 korea and five central american countries signed the rok republics of central america fta also the korean government is continuing to conduct negotiations for new ftas with other countries such as israel korea became an observer to the energy charter treaty on 17 december 2002 when its application was approved by the energy charter conference at its 11th meeting as part of a regional collaboration korea has participated in a regional comprehensive economic

free trade agreement partners australia china india japan korea and new zealand in total the grouping of 16 nations includes more than 3 billion people and accounts for about one third of total world trade if it comes to fruition the rcep agreement would create the world s largest trading bloc and would have major implications for asian countries and the world economy although it is not a bilateral or multilateral investment treaty it is important to note that korea is also a party to the agreement on government procurement gpa a plurilateral agreement on government procurement through the world trade organization wto since 1 january 1997 signatories to the agreement undertake to provide national and non discriminatory treatment to goods services and suppliers of the other signatories ensuring through detailed procedures a fair chance to compete for government contracts while korea made no specific reservations when becoming a party to the gpa annexes 1 and 2 to korea s

germany was signed in 1964 and entered into force in 1967 and included a provision for disputes to be submitted before an arbitral tribunal while no specific arbitration conventions or rules were named in the rok germany bit the provision naming arbitration as the method of dispute resolution may have encouraged korea s signing of the icsid convention mauritius convention is the state a party to the un convention on transparency in treaty based investor state arbitration mauritius convention no investment treaty programme does the state have an investment treaty programme the korean government has actively pursued investment treaties throughout every geographic region further there are domestic government agencies that govern and oversee foreign investments into korea to support the operational investment treaties in particular the ministry of trade industry and energy motie is in charge of negotiating ftas and the ministry of foreign affairs is in charge of negotiating bits the motie has been restructured and renamed several times under different presidential administrations since the inception of its predecessor agency in 1948 it was previously the ministry of commerce industry and energy 1998 to 2008 and ministry of knowledge and economy mke 2008 to 2013 but was finally given its current name in 2013 when most of the trade functions originally under the ministry of foreign affairs and trade mofat were transferred to the motie as a result of this change the motie unlike the mke is now responsible for the negotiations for ftas as well as creation of policies for foreign investment and international trade which are duties that were previously performed by the mofat the korean government has been an active participant executing ftas as a means of implementing the policy to create continual growth in the korean economy and to increase korea s prominence in international trade the adoption of the fta road map for 2003 has aided in the negotiation for ftas with numerous countries and also provides for promotion and protection for foreign investors into korea regulation of inbound foreign investment government investment promotion programmes does the state have a foreign investment promotion programme korea has implemented regimes to protect foreign investors beginning with the liberalisation of foreign investment policies in the early 1980s which has gradually progressed to further liberalisation of the korean securities markets except as otherwise prescribed by the acts of the rok a foreign national may conduct without restraint various investment activities in korea foreign nationals are restricted from foreign investments in the following cases where it threatens the maintenance of national security and public policy where it has harmful effects on public hygiene or the preservation of the environment or is against korean morals and customs and where it violates the acts and subordinate statutes of the rok in addition the korean legislature has passed laws to protect foreign investment under the foreign investment promotion act fipa with respect to proceeds from stocks bonds or other security instruments including dividends and proceeds from sales of such security instruments the liquidation of the principal interest and service charges paid and the remittance thereof to foreign countries are guaranteed in accordance with the details of the permission or report of the foreign investment contract or the licensing agreement in effect at the time of remittance this gives foreign investors the assurance that any gains from their investment into the korean economy will be transferable out of korea and gives bargaining rights to the investor and its domestic partner the korean trade investment promotion agency kotra exists as a government agency that supports foreign direct investments into korea and acts as a resource for foreign investors and domestic partners alike the motie along with kotra and the agencies under it are the main government bodies that exist specifically to promote protect and regulate foreign investments applicable domestic laws identify the domestic laws that apply to foreign investors and foreign investment including any requirements of admission or registration of investments korea has enacted a series of domestic laws that apply specifically to foreign investors and foreign investments registration requirements with the government entity that oversees the administration of any of the domestic laws along with additional reporting requirements apply to foreign investors domestic laws on foreign investment fipa was first enacted in 1998 to encourage foreign direct investments following the 1997 asian financial crisis fipa provides protection for foreign investments supports a foreign investment stimulation plan lays out foreign investment procedures and creates incentives such as tax abatement and exemptions for foreign investments simultaneously the korean government also expanded the liberalisation of the securities market and phased out ceilings on foreign direct investment into the securities market as part of the effort to boost the economy fipa is designed to facilitate foreign investment by increasing investor convenience and providing support to foreign investors fipa serves as the foundational law for foreign investment and its subordinate statutes include the following the enforcement decree of the foreign investment promotion act the enforcement rule of the foreign investment promotion act and the regulations on foreign investment and technology introduction the subordinate statutes prescribe the matters delegated in fipa and any necessary matters for the enforcement of it including clarifying restrictions on foreign investments laying out reporting and permission seeking procedures for foreign investments and outlining necessary licensing agreements and other procedures further the foreign exchange transaction act governs matters concerning those korea bound transactions that are not covered by fipa for foreign investments taxes may be abated or exempted under conditions as prescribed by the following the restriction of special taxation act the enforcement decree of the restriction of special taxation act the enforcement rule of the restriction of special taxation act and the regulations on tax abatement or exemption on foreign investment in addition to the above the following acts and statutes apply to foreign investments consolidated public notice for foreign investment notified by the ministry of trade industry and energy fscma and enforcement decree of the fscma notified by the financial services commission and regulation on financial investment business rfib and detailed rules of rfib notified by the financial supervisory service domestic requirements for foreign investment relevant procedures and regulations for foreign investors consist of foreign investment notification registration of incorporation or business registration of a foreign invested company and remittance of investment funds the procedures applied to foreign nationals are simply the same procedures that koreans and korean business entities are expected to follow with the exception of two additional steps reporting of foreign investment notification and registration of a foreign invested company when a foreign investor registers a privately owned business a registration of incorporation is not required the process of reporting a foreign investment requires designating a reporting person who may be a foreign investor or a domestic agent selecting a delegated agency such as the headquarters or branches of domestic banks domestic branches of delegated foreign banks kotra or kotra korean business centres and obtaining the certificate of completion of foreign investment notification which is issued immediately because fipa demands no delay in the processing period registration of foreign investors and reporting for foreign investments must be timely reporting for most foreign direct investments is required prior to the investment including the acquisition of new or existing stocks of 10 per cent or more equity share per foreign investor long term loans or procurement contracts and joint research and development agreements in certain circumstances reporting can be done within 30 days of the investment such as an acquisition of stocks following a merger or via a transfer of stocks reduction in the number of stocks and when there is a change or cancellation in registration of a foreign invested business registration of foreign investors should generally be done 30 days from the date of the investment relevant regulatory agency identify the state agency that regulates and promotes inbound foreign investment kotra is the overarching agency under which invest korea ik korea s national investment promotion agency was established with the purpose of supporting the entry and successful establishment of foreign businesses into korea with assistance extending to comprehensive post establishment services ik helps foreign corporations to maximise the benefits of the korean investment environment to ensure their rapid settlement in korea korea s foreign direct investment promotion regime ik implements government policies on foreign investment that have been formulated by the motie and is coordinated by the foreign investment committee which is chaired by the minister of strategy and finance in addition the motie is the agency that oversees the administration of fipa which regulates certain reporting and registration procedures and restrictions on foreign investments in korea for inbound investments into the securities markets the financial services commission fsc and financial supervisory services fss are agencies that administer certain reporting and registration processes and regulate foreign investments foreign investors are required to register with and report any over the counter trading that is selectively permitted to foreign nationals under the rfib to the fss the fsc may have the power to restrict foreign investors ownership of debt equity securities or derivatives of a certain issuer a specific class of securities or holdings in a specific business sector if such restrictions are deemed necessary for the stability of the korean financial market or for investor protection the class of securities or business sectors subject to restrictions are noted in the fscma foreign investors are required to report investments to the motie transfer funds to the korean company or organisation register the corporation or private company with the motie along with information about the business which is also a requirement for korean investors and register the corporation or business as a foreign invested company in practice the motie has delegated relevant authorities and responsibilities to other institutions including foreign exchange banks as well as kotra which is in charge of day to day operations related to the foreign investments relevant dispute agency identify the state agency that must be served with process in a dispute with a foreign investor article 2 of the act on litigation to which the state is a party provides that in cases of domestic litigation in which the state is a party or an intervenor the minister of justice shall represent the state therefore in principle the minister of justice is the proper party to be served in disputes where the state is a party in practice however in at least some of korea s investment treaty cases to date notice of a dispute has been sent to the korean president and the ambassador of the country in which the investor claims rights under an investment treaty with korea investment treaty practice model bit does the state have a model bit korea has a model bit however it is not impossible to change it is not disclosed to the public in its entirety and is not a comprehensive treaty document therefore it serves the purpose of an internal guideline for government officials when entering into a new bit or fta rather than a form treaty that has been pre approved by the legislature preparatory materials does the state have a central repository of treaty preparatory materials are such materials publicly available in principle treaty preparatory materials are not disclosed to the public and treaties themselves are not disclosed until after they take effect however since 1994 the ministry of foreign affairs has regularly made public disclosure of historic documents related to diplomatic activities under the rules on preservation and disclosure of diplomatic documents promulgated by the ministry of foreign affairs on 28 july 1993 diplomatic documents are eligible for disclosure as historical records 30 years after their preparation also pursuant to the official information disclosure act which has been in force since january 1998 a diplomatic document may be disclosed in certain forms prior to the lapse of 30 years from its preparation if there is a specific request for disclosure of such document by an individual unlike diplomatic documents parliamentary records are disclosed and can be found at the national assembly s website see www assembly go kr main acl if the national assembly requests the examination and inspection of the relevant materials prior to the execution of a treaty as an exception such materials are subject to a non disclosure inspection and the relevant lawmakers should not disclose matters examined through such inspection to the public the motie runs a separate website for ftas where the status of the execution of certain ftas can be learned for example whether it is at the negotiation stage or the research stage see www fta go kr while extensive preparatory materials may be available on korean language websites of government agencies and departments translated versions of the materials or databases may not be as readily available on english language websites additionally because the preparatory materials or guidelines are most likely created in the korean language many english translations of such materials carry a disclaimer of potential unintended errors or inaccuracies in translation scope and coverage what is the typical scope of coverage of investment treaties investment treaties typically define who is considered an investor and include specific requirements of affiliation to the party states as well as what qualifies as an investment and the types of protections afforded the contracting parties generally an investment is defined as the investment of an investor that is a national or registered entity of the territory of the party states which existed as of the date of effectuation of the treaty or was established acquired or expanded thereafter for example article 11 28 of the rok united states fta provides that the investor of a party means a party or state enterprise thereof or a national or an enterprise of a party that attempts to make is making or has made an investment in the territory of the other party provided however that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the state of his or her dominant and effective nationality similar language is used in the majority of bilateral investment treaties korea has entered into to describe the qualifications of an investor the definition of an investment as used in bits is generally defined broadly most of the earlier treaties are less descriptive in defining what qualifies as an investment yet are encompassing of any asset that may carry monetary value those treaties more recently entered into in the past 20 to 30 years and those that have been amended in recent years are slightly more descriptive yet use general terms to include both tangible and intangible property and rights both movable and immovable and for intellectual property rights and trade secrets treaties delve into the types of protections available to investors from the contracting states in extensive detail protections what substantive protections are typically available national treatment is generally included in this regard whether investments made prior to the execution of the treaty can also be protected is debated and depends on whether the matter is specifically addressed in the bit or relevant treaty however most of the ftas that korea has entered into are drafted to include pre treaty investments by including the language with respect to establishment and acquisition yet it is important to review the specific language of each treaty for in relation to the rok china bit investments with respect to the establishment and acquisition are excluded from the covered investment excluding investments made prior to the treaty most favoured nation treatment minimum standard of treatment losses and compensation thereof subrogation expropriation and compensation full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment are the commonly allotted protections there are often provisions for settlement of disputes among foreign investors into korea in addition to provisions for dispute settlement between the contracting state and the investor additionally provisions for repatriation or transfer of profits and proceeds from the investment out of the state where the investment was made are clearly stated the umbrella clause is also typically included in korea s investment treaties however based on the disclosed excerpts of the korean model bit there is a provision that the bit shall be applicable only to agreements entered into with a central government under the influence of the rok united states fta each contracting party shall observe the provisions of this agreement as well as any specific investment agreement between an authority at the central level of government of a party and investors of the other contracting party that may have entered into force dispute resolution what are the most commonly used dispute resolution options for investment disputes between foreign investors and your state foreign investors have typically brought arbitration disputes against the government of korea under icsid or uncitral rules confidentiality does the state have an established practice of requiring confidentiality in investment arbitration no owing to the relative lack of past investment arbitration cases involving korea no established practice pertaining to confidentiality exists further most of the bits and ftas contain no specific confidentiality provisions and therefore the confidentiality requirement should be subject to the rules governing the procedure that the parties choose for example icsid rules uncitral rules or icc rules however despite these rules there is a high demand from the korean public for transparency and disclosure of the procedure in the investment arbitration cases insurance does the state have an investment insurance agency or programme yes korea has a state affiliated investment insurance agency called the korea trade insurance corporation k sure formerly known as the korea export insurance corporation state backed investment insurance is not contingent on the existence of an investment treaty investment arbitration history number of arbitrations how many known investment treaty arbitrations has the state been involved in before 2012 there was only one investor state dispute claim against the korean government in 1984 colt industries operating corporation filed an arbitration claim before icsid against the korean government icsid case no arb 84 2 that was eventually settled by the parties and the order noting the discontinuance was issued on 3 august 1990 however this case was a dispute arising from licensing agreements on weapons production and not an investor state dispute based on an investment treaty between 2012 and 2017 three investment arbitration cases were filed against the korean government the first case icsid case no arb 12 37 was brought by private equity fund lone star and other claimants on the grounds that the korean government s treatment of lone star s investment in the korea exchange bank violated the terms of the rok belgium and luxembourg economic union bit the second case icsid case no arb 15 17 was a dispute about the tax treatment of an investment made by subsidiaries of the international petroleum investment company under the rok netherlands bit in this case the arbitral tribunal issued an order taking note of the discontinuance of the proceeding in october 2016 the third case was filed under uncitral rules by iranian investors who claim that shareholders with state ties aborted a sale to the investors of their stake in a korean company in violation of the rok iran bit in 2018 four new investment arbitration cases or potential cases surfaced us based hedge fund elliott associates lp filed an investment treaty claim under the rok united states fta and the 2013 uncitral rules regarding korea s alleged intervention in a merger between two samsung affiliates in a similar dispute us based mason capital management also filed an investment treaty claim against korea under the rok united states fta and the 1976 uncitral rules swiss based lift manufacturer schindler filed a notice of dispute under icsid rules against korea alleging that the country s financial regulators illegally approved a series of capital increases by hyundai s lift business and a us citizen filed an investment treaty claim at hong kong international arbitration centre under the 2013 uncitral rules and pursuant to the rok united states fta concerning an alleged expropriation of property by the korean government industries and sectors do the investment arbitrations involving the state usually concern specific industries or investment sectors to date the cases filed against korea have often involved the finance industry and in particular they have involved investments by private equity funds into korean companies and korean regulators treatment of such investments selecting arbitrator does the state have a history of using default mechanisms for appointment of arbitral tribunals or does the state have a history of appointing specific arbitrators to date there is no precedent with regard to default mechanisms although this is an area to be observed when disputes arise in the future so far the only state appointed arbitrators are brigitte stern in icsid case no arb12 37 william w park in icsid case no arb15 17 gavan griffith in the uncitral case filed by iranian investors and j christopher thomas qc in the elliott case defence does the state typically defend itself against investment claims give details of the state s internal counsel for investment disputes outside counsel has been appointed in all of the cases filed in 2012 or thereafter mentioned in the response above to question 24 internally the ministry of justice has represented korea in close coordination with relevant agencies such as the national tax service and financial services commission enforcement of awards against the state enforcement agreements is the state party to any international agreements regarding enforcement such as the 1958 un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards korea has been a party to the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention since may 1973 award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment treaty awards rendered against it to date there is no precedent on this issue unfavourable awards if not does the state appeal to its domestic courts or the courts where the arbitration was seated against unfavourable awards korea recently suffered a defeat in the uncitral investment arbitration filed by iranian investors it is understood that korea may be pursuing a challenge of the award at the seat of arbitration in the united kingdom provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory because korea is a party to the new york convention a korean court may refuse to enforce foreign arbitral awards based on public policy which is one of the grounds set forth in the convention for refusing to enforce an arbitral award the korean courts have although not often refused to enforce commercial arbitral awards based on violation of korea s public policies as for an award rendered under the icsid convention although article 54 3 of the convention states that the enforcement of an award should be made pursuant to the national law of the state in which such enforcement is sought the convention will not allow any refusal of enforcement based on domestic provisions therefore no domestic law such as the korean arbitration act can provide grounds to refuse enforcement of an icsid award there is no general provision under korean law governing sovereign immunity and sovereign immunity is not a ground for resisting arbitral awards under the korean arbitration act or under the new york convention a number of cases decided by the supreme court have involved the rok or korean government entities as parties in arbitration cases without any issue being raised as to their capacity to enter into arbitration agreements per se however there are no clear court precedents regarding the issue of sovereign immunity with respect to investor state disputes in korea there are developing debates about whether the state agreeing to an arbitration agreement implies that it has waived its sovereign immunity rights the prevailing opinion is that if the state s action is in the field of a private sector such a waiver can be easily implied however there is no clear court or statutory precedent as to this point on the other hand according to article 192 of the korean civil execution act compulsory execution against the state shall be effected by seizure of national funds the effect of this law is to limit the object to be seized to national funds only and not to other assets of the state

twelve months ended december 31 2018 respectively compared to the same periods in 2017 this increase was primarily driven by a 4 5 million fine in bolivia accrued in september 2018 related to a network outage that occurred in 2015 for additional information see note 16 commitments and contingences to the company s consolidated financial statements managing our liquidity and financial resources as of december 31 2018 the company had approximately 43 9 million in cash and cash equivalents of which 12 1 million was held by 2degrees 27 0 million was held by nuevatel and 4 8 million

facility in new zealand as of december 31 2018 cash and cash equivalents decreased 3 2 million since december 31 2017 primarily driven by purchase of property and equipment in 2018 partially offset by inflows provided by the ongoing operations of the business in november 2019 the license for 30 mhz of nuevatel s 1900 mhz spectrum holdings will expire nuevatel expects to renew the license and estimates that a payment of approximately 25 million will be due in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the expiration the payment is expected to be funded with cash resources from a combination of nuevatel s operating cash flows changes in the timing of property and equipment purchases and from the proceeds of the sale and leaseback of certain nuevatel network tower assets described below in december 2018 nuevatel entered into an 8 0 million debt facility with banco nacional de bolivia s a nuevatel drew down the 8 0 million debt facility in two 4 0 million advances that occurred in december 2018 and january 2019 in february 2019 nuevatel entered into an agreement to sell approximately 600 of nuevatel s towers to a bolivian subsidiary of phoenix tower international pti for expected cash proceeds of approximately 100 million the transaction will close in stages as conditions to close are satisfied for the towers the initial closing was completed in february 2019 for 400 towers and resulted in cash consideration of approximately 65 million we expect to complete the remainder of the closings during 2019 the towers subject to the transaction will be leased back to

december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 this change was mainly due to a 17 9 million reduction in interest paid net of capitalized interest due to a partial repayment in february 2017 and the refinancing in may 2017 of the trilogy 2019 notes this change was partially offset by an increase in eip receivables driven by a higher volume of eip receivables added in 2018 as compared to 2017 investing activities cash flow used in investing activities decreased by 57 7 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 this decrease was primarily due to lower purchases of short term investments and an increase in maturities and sales of short term investments in 2018 further spending for capital expenditures in bolivia in 2018 was lower due to the timing of 4g lte investments in 2018 financing activities cash flow used in financing activities increased by 95 8 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 this change

in the first quarter of 2019 whereby operating expenses will increase by approximately 8 million on an annualized basis additionally it is expected that the competitive conditions of the fourth quarter of 2018 will persist through 2019 consolidated capital expenditures for the full year 2019 are expected to be substantially consistent with 2018 on an absolute dollar basis in addition to our guidance of baseline consolidated capital expenditures the company may also evaluate incremental uses of capital such incremental projects may include strategic initiatives such as additional national

cautionary note regarding forward looking statements in our md a and in our aif and the related disclosure and information about various economic competitive and regulatory assumptions factors and

full year tip inc board of director approved plans any updates to our full year financial guidance over the course of the year would only be made to the guidance ranges that appear above non gaap measures and other financial measures basis of presentation in managing our business and assessing our financial performance we supplement the information provided by the financial statements presented in accordance with gaap with several customer focused performance metrics and non gaap financial measures which are utilized by our management to evaluate our performance although we believe these measures are widely used in the wireless industry some may not be defined by us in precisely the same way as by other companies in the wireless industry so there may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies adjusted ebitda represents net loss the most directly comparable gaap measure excluding amounts for income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization and accretion equity based compensation recorded as a component of general and administrative expense gain loss on disposal and abandonment of assets and all other non operating income and expenses adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are common measures of operating performance in the telecommunications industry we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful measures because they allow us to evaluate our performance by removing from our operating results items that do not relate to our core operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss the most directly comparable gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies unless the definition is the same reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and ebitda margin three months ended december 31 twelve months ended december 31 unaudited us dollars in

background foreign investment what is the prevailing attitude towards foreign investment the united kingdom has had an open door policy regarding inward foreign direct investment fdi for more than 40 years according to the world investment report of the united nations conference on trade and development unctad 2017 the united kingdom is the 23rd largest recipient of fdi the united kingdom s inward fdi stock passed the 1 trillion level in 2014 ukti inward investment report 2014 to 2015 fdi stock is a stable measure of fdi and demonstrates the long term interest of foreign investors and their confidence and commitment to the uk economy successive uk governments have sought to emphasise the business friendly aspect of uk policy in 2018 the world bank declared the united kingdom to be the seventh best place in the world for ease of doing business one of the united kingdom s strong points as an fdi destination is the relative lack of red tape and speed of formalities for instance only 17 days are required to establish a company in the united kingdom compared with the european average of 32 days which places the united kingdom in first place in europe and sixth in the world foreign companies establishing british subsidiaries generally encounter no special nationality requirements for directors or shareholders although at least one director of any company registered in the united kingdom must be ordinarily resident in the united kingdom the united kingdom has one of the lowest corporation tax rates in the g20 a relatively low minimum wage and the second largest labour force in europe the uk government has a strong track record of defending uk registered companies rights within the eu irrespective of foreign ownership considerations what are the main sectors for foreign investment in the state the united kingdom s inward fdi stock is spread across a range of industry sectors the largest concentration is in financial services 45 per cent followed by mining 9 per cent information and communication technologies 8 per cent and oil pharmaceuticals and chemicals 6 per cent according to the inward investment report 2014 to 2015 financial professional and business services received the largest number of inward fdi projects and associated jobs 515 projects representing a 34 per cent increase while the advanced manufacturing sector recorded a 12 per cent increase in the number of new investments is there a net inflow or outflow of foreign direct investment according to information published by the office of national statistics in 2015 representing data collected from 2013 to 2014 new flows of fdi abroad outward investment decreased from 28 4 billion in 2013 to a negative flow of 79 9 billion in 2014 reflecting disinvestment the uk international investment position abroad outward investment stood at 1 015 4 billion in 2014 as regards fdi into the united kingdom inward investment new flows were 44 billion in 2014 taking the international investment position of foreign companies in the united kingdom to 1 034 3 billion as such there remains aggregate net outflow of fdi in the united kingdom although the gap is steadily shrinking investment agreement legislation describe domestic legislation governing investment agreements with the state or state owned entities there are no requirements over the form of contracts entered into by foreign investors in the united kingdom whether they be with the government or with private parties international legal obligations investment treaties identify and give brief details of the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party also indicating whether they are in force to date the united kingdom has entered into 106 bilateral investment treaties bits of which 94 are currently in force this makes the united kingdom the country with the fourth most bits in the world the united kingdom is a signatory to the energy charter treaty ect an international agreement that establishes a multilateral framework for cross border cooperation in the energy industry the ect covers all aspects of commercial energy activities including trade transit investments and energy efficiency the treaty is legally binding and contains investor state dispute resolution procedures the ect has been in force in the united kingdom since 16 april 1998 if applicable indicate whether the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party extend to overseas territories uk bits typically include a territorial application provision according to which the territory of the united kingdom comprises its metropolitan territories great britain and northern ireland and any territory to which the bit is extended in accordance with an exchange of notes between the contracting parties through this mechanism the united kingdom extends the application of its bits to the crown dependencies jersey guernsey and the isle of man and its overseas territories such as bermuda and the british virgin islands such territorial extension provisions are important because the crown dependencies and uk overseas territories have separate commercial registries therefore an extension of a uk bit to a crown dependency of a uk overseas territory has the effect that legal entities incorporated in such territories also become covered investors under the bit in question currently 30 bits extend to the crown dependencies guernsey jersey and the isle of man some of these bits also extend to bermuda the cayman islands gibraltar and the turks and caicos islands the united kingdom has also extended the application of the ect to jersey guernsey and the isle of man while it is disputed whether the ect ceased to apply to gibraltar on 16 april 1998 the point at which it entered into force for the united kingdom has the state amended or entered into additional protocols affecting bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which it is a party the uk s bit practice indicates that any amendments are typically made through an exchange of notes or a protocol typically agreed to shortly after the signature of the bit see for example protocol to the uk south africa bit 1994 most of the uk s exchanges concern the territorial application of uk bits or other issues of minor importance such as exchanges made to take account of territorial succession issues see for example exchange of notes to the uk federal republic of yugoslavia bit for the amendment of the title and text of the bit from federal republic of yugoslavia to serbia the united kingdom has also replaced three bits the uk colombia bit 1994 in 2010 the uk romania bit 1976 in 1995 and the uk sierra leone bit 1981 in 2000 has the state unilaterally terminated any bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which it is a party no however south africa terminated its bit with the united kingdom on 30 august 2014 under the relevant sunset clause that bit continues in effect for a period of 20 years subsequent to that date in respect of investments made while the bit was in force has the state entered into multiple bilateral or multilateral investment treaties with overlapping membership no however the ect and certain bits apply in parallel icsid convention is the state party to the icsid convention the united kingdom signed the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states icsid convention 1965 on 26 may 1965 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 19 december 1966 the icsid convention entered into

convention the united kingdom signed the mauritius convention on 17 march 2015 but it has not ratified it yet investment treaty programme does the state have an investment treaty programme the united kingdom launched its bit programme in the early 1970s the united kingdom bit programme owes its inspiration to earlier national treaty programmes of european nations such as germany and switzerland as well as the organisation of economic co operation and development draft convention 1962 oecd on the protection of foreign property the first bit concluded by the united kingdom was with egypt in june 1975 a small number of bits with other developing countries were concluded in the latter half of the 1970s thereafter a gradual expansion in the number of bits has taken place there was rapid growth in the number of uk bits in the mid 1990s partly inspired by the break up of the former soviet union and the opportunities presented by the new markets in central and eastern europe the uk bit programme supports several key economic policy objectives from protection of investment interests overseas to promotion of market oriented policies and exports the uk bit programme s basic aims are to protect investment abroad in those countries where investors rights are not already protected through existing agreements such as treaties of friendship commerce and navigation or free trade agreements encourage the adoption of market oriented domestic policies that treat private investment in an open transparent and non discriminatory way and support the development of international law standards consistent with these objectives regulation of inbound foreign investment government investment promotion programmes does the state have a foreign investment promotion programme the national agency for the promotion of inward fdi in the united kingdom is uk trade and investment ukti ukti aims to help the economy grow by boosting exports and encouraging overseas investors to come to the united kingdom this involves providing a bespoke service for foreign direct investors including market analysis predictive targeting and tailored business propositions ukti advises companies in the search for business locations and provides assistance regarding local sector expertise clusters and hubs supply chains the availability of skills property and transport links ukti also runs programmes

ownership of real estate and there are no exchange control or currency regulations affecting foreign investment foreign companies establishing british subsidiaries generally encounter no special

foreign and british investors should be aware that they must comply with monopoly and merger rules including those prescribed by eu law depending on the size of the transaction either the eu merger regulation or part 3 of the enterprise act 2002 will apply with mergers requiring approval from either the european commission or the uk competition commission investors are also subject to an ongoing obligation to comply with eu public procurement legislation once the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union is implemented this framework is expected to change relevant regulatory agency identify the state agency that regulates and promotes inbound foreign investment ukti is the agency responsible for attracting fdi to the united kingdom it reports to the foreign office and the department for business innovation and skills as previously discussed foreign investment is not regulated per se and there is no state agency that is specifically tasked with regulating inbound

is the typical scope of coverage of investment treaties uk bits tend to cover a broad range of investments including movable and immovable property shares debt instruments intellectual property rights and business concessions and offer their protection to any foreign national or firm typically defined by incorporation under the laws in any part of the home state operating in the territory of the other country as a rule uk bits stipulate that investments will need to be made in accordance with the host state s laws failure to abide by this requirement may result in the loss of the investor s ability to claim under the applicable bit however once a foreign investor has established a lawful investment in the host state s territory it will enjoy the rights and protections set out in the relevant bit protections what substantive protections are typically available while uk bits share a core set of protections there are variations depending on the counterparty to each treaty as well as on timing broadly speaking uk bits provide investors with compensation in the event of nationalisation expropriation and equivalent measures guarantee certain minimum standards such as entitlement to fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security offer some protection against losses in the event of conflict or war affirm the right to repatriate profits and other returns and guarantee treatment in line with that accorded by the host state to investors of its most favoured nation or to the host state s own nationals dispute resolution what are the most commonly used dispute resolution options for investment disputes between foreign investors and your state no publicly available investment treaty award has been rendered against the united kingdom the only publicised claim by a foreign investor against the united kingdom pursuant to an investment treaty is ashok sanchetti v united kingdom brought under the uk india bit and the united nations commission on international trade law 1976 uncitral arbitration rules nevertheless at least 30 claims have been commenced by uk investors against foreign governments under uk bits www italaw com in terms of the most frequently occurring dispute resolution options most uk bits provide for icsid arbitration while approximately 50 uk bits provide for uncitral arbitration often in addition to or as an alternative to icsid arbitration confidentiality does the state have an established practice of requiring confidentiality in investment arbitration the lack of public information on investment arbitrations involving the united kingdom does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the united kingdom s policy on confidentiality although there are indications that the united kingdom favours confidentiality in the only publicised investment treaty arbitration brought against the united kingdom the government formally declined to release the notice of arbitration since it would

icsid convention the united kingdom has attached the reciprocity reservation to its ratification of the new york convention such that the united kingdom will apply the new york convention only to recognition and enforcement of awards made in the territory of another contracting state moreover the united kingdom has extended the application of the new york convention to the crown dependencies guernsey jersey and the isle of man and to the british overseas territories of bermuda the cayman islands and gibraltar award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment

provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory the enforcement of non icsid arbitral awards in the united kingdom is governed by the new york convention and the uk arbitration act 1996 aa 1996 which gives effect to and implements the new york convention see aa 1996 www legislation gov uk ukpga 1996 23 contents aa 1996 makes provision for the mutual recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards made in the territory of a party to the new york convention section 101 of aa 1996 such awards may be enforced by leave of the court section 101 2 of the aa 1996 recognition of new york awards may however be refused for the following reasons section 101 3 of aa 1996 that a party to the arbitration agreement was under the law applicable to it under some incapacity that the arbitration agreement was not valid under the law to which the parties subjected it or failing any indication thereon under the law of the country where the award was made that a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present its case that the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or contains decisions beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration and that the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or failing such agreement with the law of the country in which the arbitration took place in addition recognition or enforcement of a new york award may be refused if the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by arbitration or if it would be contrary to public policy to recognise or enforce the award section 103 3 of aa 1996 separate provisions apply to the recognition and enforcement of icsid awards enforcement of icsid

1966 www legislation gov uk ukpga 1966 41 contents the authors would like to thank phil devenish jagdish menezes and odysseas repousis for their assistance in preparing this chapter update and trends current developments are there any emerging trends or hot topics in your jurisdiction recently the english courts have become involved in the emergent conflict between investment treaty provisions and eu law in micula ors v romania anor the english high court stayed the enforcement of the icsid award rendered in micula et al v romania in 2013 that award was instituted pursuant to the bilateral investment treaty between sweden and romania the european commission prohibited romania from complying with the award qualifying the award payment as state aid contrary to eu law the challenge of the commission decision is currently pending before the general court of the european union and this prompted the high court to stay the enforcement until the general court decides on the matter with the relevant issues of eu law being already in contention before the general court the high court saw no reason to submit a request for a preliminary ruling to the general court the high court stressed that an icsid award has to be enforced as if a judgment of the english high court but such judgments remain subject to rules of eu law in any case in the latest development a uk appeals court affirmed the lower court s decision to stay enforcement of the award pending the resolution of the eu court process however the appeals court also ordered romania to post 150 million in security to accompany the stay of enforcement at the opinion of the court that order will assist the claimants to recover sums due to them promptly if the eu court rules in their favour another recent development is an english court judgment ordering three mauritius registered companies to provide security for costs more specifically progas energy ltd progas holding ltd and sheffield engineering company ltd initiated arbitration proceedings against pakistan however their claims were dismissed by the uncitral tribunal following this claimants applied for a set aside of the award and pakistan requested security for costs for its defence in the set aside proceedings in this context the english court ruled that claimants should provide 400 000 as security for costs what weighed heavily in favour of such an order was the fact that claimants claims were funded by pensacola investments a subsidiary of burford capital last another notable case examined by the uk courts in the course of enforcement proceedings is the tatneft v ukraine case the english high court was asked to overturn an enforcement order issued last year in favour of tatneft ukraine claimed that it had not agreed to arbitrate any claim arising out of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard which was not included in the bit and was imported through an mfn clause the court dismissed ukraine s state immunity plea by providing that ukraine had agreed to arbitrate any dispute in connection with investments and whether the fet standard could be imported through an mfn clause or not was up to the tribunal to decide on the merits ukraine further argued that tatneft had not made a protected investment and that it acquired seagroup and amruz s shares after the initiation of the dispute so being an abuse of rights however the court dismissed these arguments by clarifying that the bit s definition of investment does not require assets or property to be contributed or put in by the investor but rather to be invested the court also held that the tribunal had temporal jurisdiction and allowed an appeal to go forth only on one issue that of whether tatneft s shares with respect to seagroup and amruz fall under the protective umbrella of the definition of investment under the bit

the signing of an agreement between cabo verde and the european union for fish exports is a welcome development washington d c united states of america march 27 2019 apo group fiscal consolidation efforts should continue to preserve gains made in recent years in strengthening public finances and to support medium term debt sustainability continued progress in state owned enterprises reforms is critical to reduce fiscal risks support medium term debt sustainability and economic growth in this context the recent privatization of the national airline tacv is a positive development the improvement in financial sector indicators is welcome however banking supervision should continue to be strengthened and a resolution for the high level of legacy non performing loans is an important priority an international monetary fund imf staff team led by malangu kabedi mbuyi visited praia during march 10 25 2019 the team s discussions focused on the 2019 article iv consultation and on the authorities policy initiatives and reforms for the medium term that could be supported by the imf further discussions on these reforms will take place in washington d c in the coming weeks at the end of the visit mrs kabedi mbuyi issued the following statement the recent momentum in economic growth continues after an average growth of about 1 percent during 2009 15 real gross domestic product gdp expanded by 4 percent in 2017 and by an estimated 4 7 percent in 2018 reflecting robust activity in the industry fishery commerce and tourism sectors for 2019 and the medium term real gdp growth is forecasted in the range of 4 8 to 5 percent the abovementioned factors will remain important contributors to real gdp however enhancing growth prospects to reach 5 percent will require sustained implementation of wide reaching reforms to address long standing impediments to growth improve the business environment and attract foreign direct investment in this context the recent privatization of the national airline company tacv is welcome cabo verde s external position strengthened in 2018 with the current account deficit narrowing to 4 5 percent of gdp 6 6 percent of gdp in 2017 owing to strong export performance increased remittances and deceleration in imports demand the signing of an agreement between cabo verde and the european union for fish exports is a welcome development in this context gross international reserves increased and reached 5 1 months of prospective imports at end december 2018 in the fiscal area the overall deficit narrowed mostly because of strong revenue performance consistent with sustained economic activity and implementation of revenue administration measures the overall deficit declined from 3 percent of gdp in 2017 to an estimated 2 8 percent of gdp in 2018 however financing needs rose from 3 4 percent of gdp to 3 9 percent of gdp as budget support to financially strained state owned enterprises soes increased for 2019 current projections show that the budgeted deficit of 3 percent of gdp is achievable through an effective implementation of revenue measures contemplated in the budget and expenditure restraint the stock of public debt is estimated at 125 percent of gdp at end december 2018 down from 127 percent in 2017 going forward further improvement in the fiscal position is needed to increase fiscal space for capital expenditure build fiscal buffers and reduce the risk of debt distress over the medium term this will require sustained implementation of reforms to broaden the tax base increase efficiency in tax administration improve tax compliance strengthen capital expenditure management and maintain a tight control on current expenditure further progress in soes reforms is also critical for medium term fiscal and debt sustainability objectives the monetary policy stance appears appropriate given low inflationary pressures and the level of international reserves however continued caution is needed the central bank bcv needs to continue monitoring developments in the euro area closely and stand ready to change the monetary policy stance as needed and should continue to maintain a high level of

by rsis the dilemma of the us is to restore the manufacturing sector and the fiscal balance of the indebted nation at the same time to solve this dilemma and the shortage of liquidity in global financial markets the chinese yuan and the japanese yen will have to be further internationalised by dr tomoo kikuchi and yohei tanaka the last trade war that the united states fought against the world s second largest economy was in the 1970s witht japan that trade war fundamentally changed the structure of the japanese economy while the nature of the us trade deficit remained unchanged in the early 1980s japan accounted for 50 percent of the us trade deficit today china accounts for nearly 50 percent of the us deficit the executive order 13806 by president trump conveys that the restoration of the manufacturing sector is a matter of national security the dilemma of the us is to restore the manufacturing sector and the fiscal balance of the indebted nation at the same time to resolve this dilemma and the shortage of liquidity in global financial markets the chinese yuan and the japanese yen will have to be further internationalised reducing excessive dependence on us dollar internationalisation of stock markets in tokyo shanghai and shenzhen and promotion of the chinese yuan and the japanese yen as settlement and clearing currencies in energy markets will reduce the excessive dependence on the us dollar in the global financial markets at the same time it will reduce the pressure for the us to appreciate in the long run moreover china has to make a transition from an economy driven by export to one driven by consumption to solve the trade imbalance with the us the america first policy by president trump is a response to the obama administration which seemingly prioritised the wall street over the main street in his executive order 13806 he warns that the deterioration of the manufacturing industry has undermined the defence industry hence affecting the national security his task force reports that the us lost seven million manufacturing jobs 36 of the industry s workforce from 1979 to 2017 out of which more than five million were lost since 2000 us trade deficit with china and japan the us trade deficit with china has been rising since 2000 while that with japan has been constant by investing their trade surpluses in the us treasury securities japan and china more recently have become the biggest holders of the us treasury securities the us net foreign debt amounts to 8 6 trillion dollars today since 1998 when japan s net foreign asset was us 1 3 trillion equal to the us net foreign debt the us net foreign debt has grown 2 7 times of japan s net foreign asset this is alarming for the us as china unlike japan is not an ally of the us the us and japan have had policy dialogues and agreements over many decades to coordinate policies in fact the foreign purchase of the treasuries has declined since its peak in 2010 and became even negative in recent years this means that foreign investors have sold their treasuries holdings the dilemma between the normalisation of the interest rate and the long term goal to restore its manufacturing sector is hard to resolve as the us possesses both the largest debt in the world and the key global currency at the same time for the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector a weak dollar is desirable but the monetary policy normalisation will strengthen the dollar if the federal reserve lowers the interest rate capital will flow out of the us making it hard to sustain the debt too on the other hand if the fed continues to raise the interest rate capital outflow from the emerging economies may destabilise the world economy china s challenges since joining the world trade organisation in 2001 china s real gross domestic product has grown more than 300 from 2 4 trillion in 2001 to 10 2 trillion in 2017 during that period the us real gross domestic product grew less than 40 from 12 8 trillion in 2001 to 17 3 trillion in 2017 the european chamber of commerce documents that in 2015 china produced 28 of the world s automobiles 41 of the world s ships 80 of the world s computers 90 of the world s mobile phones 60 of the world s tv sets 50 of the world s refrigerators 80 of the world s air conditioners 24 of the world s power and 50 of the world s steel in 2017 china surpassed the us to become the largest oil importer in the world the trade imbalances between the us and china will not be resolved until china has made its transition from an export driven economy to a consumption driven one to achieve this china faces myriad of challenges at home ranging from the state owned sector reform rising debt problems to liberalising the capital market in addressing these challenges china will need to cooperate with the us in the manner that japan addressed us concerns starting with the structural impediments initiative in 1989 which led japan to open domestic markets to foreign companies and made the economy driven more by domestic demand to reduce trade imbalances yuan yen should be internationalised meanwhile the chinese yuan and the japanese yen will have to grow in significance to supply the global liquidity shortage caused by the monetary policy normalisation and the restructuring of the us economy the chinese yuan will become more significant as china will continue to grow as the world s largest energy consumer in fact yuan denominated oil futures began trading on the shanghai futures exchange for the first time in march 2018 trading volumes in shanghai have already overtaken those of the dubai mercantile exchange s oil contract to become the world s third most traded oil benchmark after brent in london and west texas intermediate in new york the yuan will however not take over the role of the dollar in the near future given the multiple challenges mentioned above therefore japan should assist both yuan and dollar by further internationalising the yen as a supplementary currency for loans to emerging economies offering yen denominated bonds and commodity futures and internationalising the tokyo stock exchange this will stabilise the global financial market by reducing the excess liquidity and over dependence on the us dollar and by supporting free trade and guaranteeing liquidity of trading

download logo fiscal consolidation efforts should continue to preserve gains made in recent years in strengthening public finances and to support medium term debt sustainability continued progress in state owned enterprises reforms is critical to reduce fiscal risks support medium term debt sustainability and economic growth in this context the recent privatization of the national airline tacv is a positive development the improvement in financial sector indicators is welcome however banking supervision should continue to be strengthened and a resolution for the high level of legacy non performing loans is an important priority an international monetary fund imf staff team led by malangu kabedi mbuyi visited praia during march 10 25 2019 the team s discussions focused on the 2019 article iv consultation and on the authorities policy initiatives and reforms for the medium term that could be supported by the imf further discussions on these reforms will take place in washington d c in the coming weeks at the end of the visit mrs kabedi mbuyi issued the following statement the recent momentum in economic growth continues after an average growth of about 1 percent during 2009 15 real gross domestic product gdp expanded by 4 percent in 2017 and by an estimated 4 7 percent in 2018 reflecting robust activity in the industry fishery commerce and tourism sectors for 2019 and the medium term real gdp growth is forecasted in the range of 4 8 to 5 percent the abovementioned factors will remain important contributors to real gdp however enhancing growth prospects to reach 5 percent will require sustained implementation of wide reaching reforms to address long standing impediments to growth improve the business environment and attract foreign direct investment in this context the recent privatization of the national airline company tacv is welcome cabo verde s external position strengthened in 2018 with the current account deficit narrowing to 4 5 percent of gdp 6 6 percent of gdp in 2017 owing to strong export performance increased remittances and deceleration in imports demand the signing of an agreement between cabo verde and the european union for fish exports is a welcome development in this context gross international reserves increased and reached 5 1 months of prospective imports at end december 2018 in the fiscal area the overall deficit narrowed mostly because of strong revenue performance consistent with sustained economic activity and implementation of revenue administration measures the overall deficit declined from 3 percent of gdp in 2017 to an estimated 2 8 percent of gdp in 2018 however financing needs rose from 3 4 percent of gdp to 3 9 percent of gdp as budget support to financially strained state owned enterprises soes increased for 2019 current projections show that the budgeted deficit of 3 percent of gdp is achievable through an effective implementation of revenue measures contemplated in the budget and expenditure restraint the stock of public debt is estimated at 125 percent of gdp at end december 2018 down from 127 percent in 2017 going forward further improvement in the fiscal position is needed to increase fiscal space for capital expenditure build fiscal buffers and reduce the risk of debt distress over the medium term this will require sustained implementation of reforms to broaden the tax base increase efficiency in tax administration improve tax compliance strengthen capital expenditure management and maintain a tight control on current expenditure further progress in soes reforms is also critical for medium term fiscal and debt sustainability objectives the monetary policy stance appears appropriate given low inflationary pressures and the level of international reserves however continued caution is needed the central bank bcv needs to continue monitoring developments in the euro area closely and stand ready to change the monetary policy stance as needed and should continue to maintain a high level of reserves to protect the peg and increase the economy s resilience to adverse shocks to enhance the efficiency of monetary policy further actions are needed to strengthen the monetary policy transmission mechanism the bcv s continued efforts to strengthen banking sector supervision are welcome in 2018 financial stability indicators improved and banks profitability

monetary policy in the euro area speech by mario draghi president of the ecb at the conference the ecb and its watchers xx frankfurt am main 27 march 2019 the last year has seen a loss of growth momentum in the euro area which has extended into 2019 this has been predominantly driven by pervasive uncertainty in the global economy that has spilled over into the external sector so far the domestic economy has remained relatively resilient and the drivers of the current expansion remain in place however the risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside the monetary policy measures we took at the last governing council meeting reflect this assessment in the face of a weaker growth outlook they help maintain the accommodative policy stance that we managed to preserve last year as we rotated our instruments from net asset purchases to forward guidance our policy thereby continues to accompany the economy on its path towards our inflation objective the outlook for the euro area economy we expected the expansion to slow in 2018 as the business cycle matured and growth retreated towards potential but as the economy weakened in the second part of last year it was not yet certain whether we were witnessing a temporary departure from this scenario or a more lasting deterioration in the growth outlook the drivers of the deceleration back then appeared to some extent to be idiosyncratic and short lived relating to the effect of emissions standards on the euro area car industry and a normalisation of world trade from its very strong growth rates in 2017 yet it was clear that the loss of growth momentum could become more broad based and persistent if two risks were to materialise first if external demand were to remain weak and second if this were to spill over into domestic demand in the meantime the first risk has by and large been realised the weakness in world trade has continued which has significantly affected the manufacturing sector global goods import growth in january reached its lowest level since the great recession on the back of rising uncertainty about trade disputes and a slowdown in emerging market economies especially china as a result growth in extra euro area goods exports was negative at the end of last year for the first time since january 2016 and industrial production fell by 4 2 year on year in december its largest decline since 2013 before recovering somewhat in january indicators such as new export orders which have historically been closely associated with industrial production remain in negative territory so we are now seeing a more persistent deterioration of external demand but a soft patch does not necessarily foreshadow a serious slump during the four euro area business cycle expansions since 1970 there have been 50 soft patches defined as a two quarter growth slowdown and only 4 recessions in fact the euro area faced an analogous situation in 2016 when the economy also went through a soft patch triggered by a contraction in world trade at that time the strength of the domestic economy was able to shield the recovery from external uncertainties the key question is whether with monetary policy continuing to support the expansion domestic demand will remain as resilient today the demand component typically affected most by a weaker global environment is investment ecb internal analysis shows that the more exposed euro area listed firms are to foreign markets the more sensitive they are to uncertainty when making their investment decisions and there are some signs that external demand may be affecting investment via manufacturing value chains within the euro area in particular both extra and intra euro area trade slowed steeply last year whereas in 2016 intra euro area trade was robust to the external slowdown such a recoupling of intra and extra euro area trade growth in a downward direction has not occurred since the start of the global financial crisis intra euro area exports of intermediate and capital goods were hit particularly hard with capital goods exports registering their strongest contraction since the sovereign debt crisis a further rise in global uncertainty could therefore lead to a deceleration in trade and investment but for now expectations for investment remain relatively robust though professional forecasters have slightly downgraded their projections for investment growth this year from around 3 to around 2 5 the fundamentals are in place for investment to rebound if global growth stabilises capacity utilisation stands close to its long term maximum financing conditions remain very favourable and corporate leverage as a percentage of total assets has fallen to levels last witnessed in the early years of emu although gross corporate indebtedness as a percentage of gross value added still stands above its pre crisis level the latest surveys also suggest some recovery in business sentiment while consumption is typically less affected by external developments its growth rate has slowed over the last year higher uncertainty may have played a role as reflected in the rise in the household saving rate over the course of 2018 but the main drivers were idiosyncratic factors unrelated to the global economy coupled with country specific factors in france and italy the most important issue for the consumption outlook is the labour market since higher employment has been the major driver of consumption during the current expansion so far the labour market has been resilient to the growth slowdown while employment growth moderated in the second half of last year in 2018 it was significantly higher than would be expected based on the static long term relationship between employment and gdp growth as a result real disposable income has remained resilient and households assessment of their own financial situation which is a good leading indicator of consumption remains positive the resilience of the employment consumption relationship helps explain why even as the manufacturing outlook has worsened services have remained relatively robust services is the most labour intensive sector and is associated closely with consumers expenditure there are however lags between changes in gdp and in employment and surveys on employment while remaining in expansionary territory have decelerated since the middle of last year so should the growth slowdown turn into a more persistent phenomenon employment and consumption are likely to be affected all in all the current data suggest that external demand has not yet spilled over significantly into domestic demand but the risks have risen in the last months and uncertainty remains high this is why our medium term outlook remains that growth will gradually return to potential but the risks remain tilted to the downside that outlook is also being buttressed by the pre emptive reaction of stabilisation policies fiscal policy in the euro area has become mildly expansionary with the aggregate fiscal stance expected to be 0 4 of gdp in 2019 after five years of being broadly neutral and our forward guidance on monetary policy has been effective as shown by the continuing easing of financial conditions since last december the outlook for wages and inflation the weakening growth picture has naturally affected the inflation outlook as well our projections for headline inflation this year have been revised downwards and we now see inflation at 1 6 in 2021 slower growth will also lead to a more muted recovery in underlying inflation than we had previously expected reflecting the weaker outlook market based measures of inflation expectations have edged down recently the fall in market based measures has mainly been driven by a decline in inflation risk premia a volatile component of overall inflation linked swap rates not by a drop in genuine inflation expectations while a decrease in inflation risk premia may suggest that market participants assign increased prominence to lower than expected outcomes of future inflation survey based measures have remained relatively stable we therefore remain confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim has been delayed rather than derailed meaning that we expect inflation to reach our objective at a later date than we previously foresaw this view is based on our assessment of the resilience of the labour market and therefore of wage growth wage dynamics have so far broadly withstood the growth slowdown growth in compensation per employee fell slightly in the last quarter of 2018 from 2 5 to 2 2 but remains just above its long term average unit labour cost growth rose to 2 4 in the same period partly driven by a fall in productivity growth reflecting the resilience of employment growth to the economic slowdown the key question and one currently being asked in many advanced economies is why these labour cost pressures are not already being reflected in rising prices underlying inflation has moved broadly sideways over the last year repeatedly falling short of expectations and staying below the levels recorded before 2008 academic literature based on us data has responded by casting doubt on the link between labour costs and inflation in particular at shorter horizons studies find no conclusive results on whether empirically labour costs tend to precede or follow prices this has led to a debate as to whether cost push models from wages to prices can still accurately describe the inflation process there are certainly a number of forces at work today that make forecasting inflation more complex not least the effects of globalisation and digitalisation yet research by ecb staff finds that unlike in the united states the structural conditions for pass through from wages to prices remain in place in the euro area over the period from 1985 to 2018 there is a continuing link between labour cost and price inflation in the four major euro area economies and across the three main sectors pass through is on the whole strongest in the services sector where wages account for around 40 of costs that is important for the current inflation outlook given the resilience of services to the growth slowdown what appears to be delaying the pass through today is the fact that firms are absorbing labour cost increases by squeezing profit margins this reflects two cyclical factors first the euro area is coming out of a prolonged period of low inflation which historically leads to a slower pass through one reason is that price dispersion is narrower when inflation is low implying that if an individual firm were to raise its prices it would attract the attention of consumers and lose market share firms are therefore more reluctant to pass on cost increases to consumers the second factor is the softening of activity in 2018 labour costs are typically passed on more strongly to prices when demand is stronger so the fact that the euro area has recently experienced a negative demand shock is likely to have held firms back from raising prices the delay in pass through may also be explained by an additional factor which is lower imported inflation over the last two years this has been reflected since late summer 2017 in a growing discrepancy between the growth of the gdp deflator and core inflation the gdp deflator has followed a more pronounced upward trend rising from 0 6 at the end of 2016 to 1 5 at the end of 2018 one development that may have contributed to lower imported inflation was the appreciation of the euro exchange rate by around 8 in nominal effective terms over the last two years ecb internal analysis suggests that this had an impact on non energy industrial goods inflation in 2018 especially for durable goods the upshot is that the pass through of wages to prices is likely to be moderate until these various factors have played out but there are several reasons to believe that they will unwind over the medium term our monetary policy will remain accommodative and will respond to any changes in the inflation outlook the effects of exchange rate appreciation have now reversed demand should recover so long as the downside risks to our outlook do not materialise and with stronger demand firms should be able to rebuild margins moreover even if the economy were to slow more than expected the risks to wage growth may be contained since the end of 2017 wage growth has been driven less by wage drift and more by negotiated wages which are more persistent and react more slowly to cyclical labour market conditions negotiated wages for 2019 have to a substantial degree already been set by previous negotiating rounds the outlook for monetary policy substantial accommodation is still needed to secure the path of inflation convergence and this is reflected in our past monetary policy decisions in parallel to winding down net purchases we have strengthened our forward guidance on interest rates and bond reinvestments this has allowed us to rotate the instruments used to set the policy stance while leaving the stance itself broadly unchanged our forward guidance framework has been specifically designed to accompany the economy by facilitating needed adjustments in the policy stance as the outlook evolves it works along three main dimensions first the state based leg of our guidance ensures that interest rate expectations are anchored to our ultimate inflation objective and thereby acts as an automatic stabiliser in the event of downside risks emerging second the date based leg provides extra information to focus rate expectations over the near term third since our forward guidance on reinvestments is tied to our guidance on rates adjustments to rate guidance automatically entail a change of the reinvestment horizon in the same direction this reinforces the easing impact of a flatter expected rate path by compressing the term premium component of longer term interest rates we will continue monitoring how banks can maintain healthy earning conditions while net interest margins are compressed and if necessary we need to reflect on possible measures that can preserve the favourable implications of negative rates for the economy while mitigating the side effects if any that said low bank profitability is not an inevitable consequence of negative rates ecb analysis finds that the best performing banks in the euro area in terms of return on equity between 2009 and 2017 share three key features they have been able to significantly reduce their cost to income ratios they have embarked on large scale investments in information technology and they have been able to diversify their revenue sources in a low interest rate environment at its last meeting the governing council decided based on the weaker outlook for inflation to extend the date based leg of our rate guidance at least through the end of 2019 that in turn implies that we will continue to keep the very sizeable stock of assets bought under the asset purchase programme unchanged for even longer the governing council also decided to launch a new series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii in order to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and maintain the efficient bank based transmission of our policy these decisions ensure that our policy stance remains accommodative in the face of a weaker growth outlook and the calibration of the remaining parameters of the tltro iii will reflect the evolving macroeconomic conditions our current reaction function is well designed to respond to further delays in inflation convergence in such a situation just as we did at our march meeting we would ensure that monetary policy continues to accompany the economy by adjusting our rate forward guidance to reflect the new inflation outlook but the commitment to our objective also implies alertness to future risks and a readiness to respond to them should the medium term outlook continue to deteriorate significantly in this case as well the ecb will adopt all the monetary policy actions that are necessary and proportionate to achieve its objective we are not short of instruments to deliver on our mandate

weekend the caixin s manufacturing pmi will also be reported then while the official manufacturing pmi is expected to have ticked up most forecast it to remain below the 50 boom bust level the non manufacturing pmi may have eased to 54 0 from 54 3 the reserve bank of new zealand was more dovish than investors expected governor orr was explicit the next move in rates is likely lower the central bank had previously taken a neutral stance the currency fell from a little above 0 6900 around where it had topped out several times in the past few months to briefly below 0 6800 the 100 day moving average is near 0 6810 and has generally provided support on a closing basis since early january it also corresponds to a 38 2 retracement objective of the rally since the flash crash january 3 we

europe the british house of commons has not really wrestled control of brexit away from the prime minister at most they have a time out for the day but may might still try to influence today s non binding indicative votes remember the new timetable the uk has until the end of the week to pass the withdrawal bill if not it must ask for a longer extension or leave without an agreement on april 12 april 12 was not an arbitrary date it is the deadline to compete in the late may eu parliament elections how can the withdrawal bill which has been twice overwhelmingly defeated pass the stark reality of the alternatives including participating in the next eu parliament elections appears too much for many of the hard brexit camp to accept after having been unable to defeat may in a vote of confidence some tories are offering support for the withdrawal bill if the prime minister resigns the ecb s draghi s comment that the officials may look to mitigate the impact of negative rates on the interest rate margin of banks european bank shares like those in the us have faltered as the prospect of so low rates and flat curve weighs on the interest earning activity of banks the euro appeared to slip lower in response as it further confirms that negative rates are here for some time draghi also reiterated that the economic risks remain on the downside the poor flash pmi readings seem to leave him little choice though the german ifo report makes us reluctant to jettison our hypothesis that the worst has passed turkey s central bank has engineered a powerful short squeeze and without fresh liquidity injections the implied overnight interest rate jumped to 360 yesterday and the dollar fell to almost try5 30 recall that at the end of last week the dollar had traded a little above try5 85 the disruption and volatility will likely deter speculators ahead of the local elections sunday the lira s 1 1 loss today leads the emerging market currencies today hungary surprised investors yesterday the central bank hiked rates but also announced a corporate bond buying program it lifted the overnight deposit rate from minus 15 bp to minus five officials neutralized whatever positive impact it would have on the forint by noting that it was a one off move at the same time it announced plans to buy huf300 bln of corporate bonds the euro surged 0 75 yesterday against the forint and has extended those gains today by another 0 35 through march 19 the forint had been a strong performer gaining nearly 3 against the euro since the start of the year however even before yesterday s decision the euro had begun recovering with today s gains the euro has extended its late march rally to almost 2 4 today is the first day that the euro has not traded above 1 13 since march 11 it still may though there is an option struck there for almost 690 mln euros that expires today and the intraday technicals warn that the euro s recovery in the european morning from a little below 1 1250 to 1 1285 may falter as us dealers return the uncertainty over brexit and today s house of commons votes are leaving the sterling uninspired and trading in relatively narrow ranges straddling 1 32 the five and 20 day averages converge just below 1 32 america the inversion of part of the us yield curve continues to cause consternation among investors as the implications are being mulled over we make the following suggestions first surveys suggested that nearly 2 3 of economists expected a recession in 2020 or 2021 which is within the lag between the inversion and economic impact the point is that the inversion of part of the curve reinforces what many had already anticipated second the inversion of the curve is partial and shallow consider for example that the five to 30 year curve is the steepest since 2017 third the average fed funds rate in past inversions has been more than twice the prevailing level fourth the decline in the us 10 year yield is not just a function of us economic prospects but also the fact that there is more than 10 trillion of negative yielding bonds the us and canada report on january trade figures today economists expect both countries to report narrower trade deficits canada s merchandise deficit is expected to be reduced to c 3 55 bln from c 4 59 bln last december which was a record the us trade deficit swelled to its widest in nearly a decade at the end of 2018 the december shortfall was almost 60 bln and that is despite the incredible improvement in the energy trade balance the trump administration appears to focus on two numbers more than others the first is the stock market and the other is the trade balance the criticism faced over the swelling deficit may make the administration even tougher on trade going forward mexico reports its february trade balance today it is expected to have swung into surplus from a large deficit in january the us dollar is trading quietly against the canadian dollar and continues to

typical scope of coverage of investment treaties there is no set definition of investment that is applicable to all uae bits although generally in each bit investment it is defined broadly for example the uk uae bit defines investment as every kind of asset owned or controlled by investors of either of the contracting parties which includes though not exclusively movable and immovable property and property rights such as mortgages liens or pledges shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company liquid assets deposits and claims to money or to performance under a contract having financial value intellectual property rights goodwill technical processes and know how and business concessions conferred by law or under contract including concessions to exploit natural resources protections what substantive protections are typically available not all uae bits contain the same substantive protections or express standards of treatment in the same way however below are some common provisions in most uae bits fair and equitable treatment most uae bits have a broad clause which provides that each contracting party shall accord to investments by investors of the other contracting state fair and equitable treatment eg the austria uae bit however other fair and equitable treatment clauses provide an express reference to fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of international law eg the bits with armenia france and mongolia unreasonable arbitrary or discriminatory measures most uae bits prohibit government measures that are unreasonable arbitrary or discriminatory and that impair or harm an investment most favoured nation clauses many uae bits contain some form of most favoured nation mfn protection usually the mfn clause provides that the contracting states shall accord to investments of investors of the other contracting party treatment not less favourable than the treatment that it accords to investments of its own investors or investors of any third state however some uae mfn clauses provide that the mfn requirement does not require the contracting state to offer investors the same treatment as the state guarantees to members of free trade areas customs and economic unions and similar agreements eg the bits with armenia finland malaysia and russia expropriation each uae bit contains provisions on expropriation although the exact formulations of the expropriation provisions vary in general expropriation is not prohibited but it must be for a public purpose be followed by fair compensation and not be discriminatory the bits with italy romania tajikistan turkmenistan and ukraine also expressly prohibit expropriation in violation of a contractual provision regarding stabilisation umbrella clauses not all uae bits contain an umbrella clause the bits with armenia belarus china malaysia mongolia pakistan switzerland and the united kingdom contain umbrella clauses although the formulation of the umbrella clause in each bit is slightly different dispute resolution what are the most commonly used dispute resolution options for investment disputes between foreign investors and your state some uae bits allow for immediate recourse to arbitration while others require a claimant to first seek a remedy through negotiations or in the host state courts however most of the uae bits provide for arbitration under the unictral or icsid rules confidentiality does the state have an established practice of requiring confidentiality in investment arbitration there is no express confidentiality practice and no express confidentiality provisions are included in the arbitration clauses in uae bits therefore any arbitration involving the uae is likely to adhere to the confidentiality provisions if any in the rules of the relevant arbitral institution insurance does the state have an investment insurance agency or programme the united arab emirates is a member of the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit which aims to facilitate trade and investment between member countries and the world through sharia compliant risk mitigation tools it is also a member of the islamic development bank investment arbitration history number of arbitrations how many known investment treaty arbitrations has the state been involved in on 28 june 2017 a turkish contractor bm mühendislik ve i̇nşaat aş registered a claim against the united arab emirates icsid case no arb 17 20 a tribunal of l yves forier canada charles brower united states and zachary douglas australia has been constituted and as of 4 september 2018 the claimant has filed its memorial on the merits there have been only two previous cases brought before icsid arbitral tribunals against the united arab emirates namely impregilo spa and rizzani de eccher spa v united arab emirates icsid case no arb 01 1 and hussein nauman soufraki v united arab emirates icsid case no arb 02 7 the decision and dissenting opinions in the case of soufraki have been extensively considered and provide a useful summary of icsid jurisprudence on the determination of issues of effective nationality and the weight to be given to national laws of the parties the impregilo case is understood to have been settled on confidential terms in the first half of 2018 two further icsid cases involving uae investors were registered rasia fze uae and joseph k borkowski usa v republic of armenia icsid case no arb 18 28 and société des parcs d alger algerian and emirates international investment company llc uae v people s democratic republic of algeria icsid case no arb 18 11 jurisdiction challenges have been raised in the two icsid cases involving uae investors that were registered in 2017 dp world limited v kingdom of belgium icsid case no arb 17 21 and itisaluna iraq llc and others v republic of iraq icsid case no arb 17 10 with vtel holdings ltd and vtel middle east and africa limited being the uae claimant parties and it remains to be seen how these cases will affect perceptions of investor state arbitrations in the united arab emirates industries and sectors do the investment arbitrations involving the state usually concern specific industries or investment sectors the known investment treaty arbitrations involving the united arab emirates or investors from it have concerned disputes arising out of the construction industry and transportation and telecommunications sectors selecting arbitrator does the state have a history of using default mechanisms for appointment of arbitral tribunals or does the state have a history of appointing specific arbitrators there are no reportable trends on the use of default mechanisms for the appointment of arbitral tribunals or the appointment of specific arbitrators defence does the state typically defend itself against investment claims give details of the state s internal counsel for investment disputes no the state typically instructs international counsel to represent it in investment disputes enforcement of awards against the state enforcement agreements is the state party to any international agreements regarding enforcement such as the 1958 un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the united arab emirates is a party to the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention which entered into force on 19 november 2006 following ratification on 13 june 2006 in addition the united arab emirates is a party to the following multilateral conventions the riyadh convention on judicial cooperation between states of the arab league 1983 which entered into force in 1999 the gcc convention for the execution of judgments delegations and judicial notifications 1996 and the investment protection agreement of the organisation of islamic cooperation 1981 which was ratified by the uae in 1989 the uae has also entered into a number of bilateral treaties relating to judicial cooperation including the treaty on judicial cooperation in criminal matters extradition of offenders cooperation in civil commercial and personal matters with morocco 2006 the treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters extradition of offenders cooperation in civil commercial and personal matters service

recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters with france 1992 and the agreement on legal and judicial cooperation with somalia 1982 a number of the international agreements regarding enforcement to which the united arab emirates is a party eg the riyadh and gcc conventions permit it to refuse to recognise or enforce a foreign judgment or award made against it or one of its officials award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment treaty awards rendered against it not applicable see question 24 unfavourable awards if not does the state appeal to its domestic courts or the courts where the arbitration was seated against unfavourable awards not applicable provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory the uae civil procedure code contains an overall prohibition on seizing public property owned by the state or one of the emirates for the purposes of enforcement article 247 there are also additional sovereign immunity laws in dubai although not abu dhabi or the other emirates that prohibit filing of lawsuits by or against the ruler without obtaining his approval provide that the filing of lawsuits by or against the government of dubai and any department thereof including public corporations is subject to certain pre filing formalities being complied with notably submitting details of the claim to the government of dubai s legal adviser not issuing a claim for two months after submission to the legal adviser and obtaining an order from the diwan director in order to enforce any successful judgment and prohibit the recovery of debts or obligations of the government of dubai and any department thereof including public corporations by attachment sale by auction or taking possession in any other legal manner of their properties and assets dubai law no 3 of 1996 update and trends current developments are there any emerging trends or hot topics in your jurisdiction value added tax value added tax vat was introduced on 1 january 2018 at a standard rate of 5 per cent vat is now applied on the supply or import of goods and services apart from those that are vat exempt or zero rated it remains to be seen what impact the implementation of vat will have on the investment environment in the united arab emirates federal arbitration law in june 2018 the federal arbitration law came into force based on the uncitral model law the federal arbitration law provides a more detailed framework for international arbitration proceedings in the federation and replaces the largely outdated provisions of the uae civil procedure code the new law remains untested and it is likely that at least initially there may be inconsistent interpretations of the law by the uae courts however the federal arbitration law is a welcome introduction and should add to investor confidence in the united arab emirates
cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings

that far exceed the debt on some school buildings this is the world of charter school real estate in new jersey where public money can disappear in a maze of intertwined companies where businesses and

monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator

financing or lease agreements before they are signed they don t monitor the associated groups that own real estate for charter schools and new jersey has issued more than 800 million in bonds to construct purchase and renovate charter school buildings without any agency considering who will own them or how much the public will pay in rent dwight berg an economist who has worked on charter school facility deals around the country said new jersey s law doesn t make any sense and has pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities to leasing i m sure that s

talks about the original vision for charter schools in the state kevin r wexler northjersey charter operators point out that most of those private groups are nonprofits and maintain they are keeping facility costs down but many details about them are not available to the public because support companies are private it s often impossible to see routine information such as interest rates on loans debt on school facilities or what happens to the money once it leaves the public charter school that lack of transparency is compounded by charter operators who have declined to discuss the details of complicated financial deals that leave property in private hands indefinitely bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing we left these

regulatory parameters at the time to make those decisions when the time comes but that s not always the case quick sale a newark charter school changes hands team academy s leaders orchestrated a complicated arrangement more than eight years ago to make sure a 22 million high school building ends up in private hands however a federal tax rule requires the building to be owned by the public once the bonds issued to finance it have been repaid the deal was sanctioned by the new jersey redevelopment authority and by the administration of newark s mayor cory booker presidential candidate and new jersey s junior u s senator the building on norfolk street is owned by a private nonprofit company with ties to the charter school that was created to issue bonds for the project under a

support groups will over time control more and more property funded by taxpayers doria the former legislator said lawmakers never anticipated that many of new jersey s charter schools would have more than 500 students each this year the state expected 30 charter schools to have more than 500 students and 13 to have enrollments exceeding 1 000 joseph doria a former state senator who was a sponsor

thomas contracted to buy them from the city but the friends instead allowed them to be sold to a for profit developer the developer then sold them to the friends after about two months in the case of one building and just shy of a year later in the other for a 150 percent price hike fees of almost 6 4 million accounted for much of the increase rent from charter schools funded by taxpayers will

line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership raises a multitude of issues there s the ethical problem of buying private property with public dollars but there s also the way in which it ties the hands of the policy makers said gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury building owner and developers who have renovated properties and strike long term multimillion dollar leases with schools uncommon schools newest north star academy facility located at 571 585 18th ave

public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with

time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company

collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments

available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private owner nca facility another charter school briefly rented the building last year but it s been vacant since november for now team academy continues to pay 350 000 in annual rent on an empty building this building at 18 norfolk street in newark is owned by a group that supports team academy the charter school isn t using the building this school year but continues to pay rent kevin r wexler northjersey com cory booker pushes a redevelopment deal in a march 2010 email to the newark city clerk booker requested that the city council consider a resolution naming the friends of team as the exclusive redeveloper of the norfolk street property adding that this item is time sensitive the measure passed unanimously two weeks later a team administrator explained plans to finance the 22 million norfolk street project in a letter to the state redevelopment authority dated that october ryan hill then team academy s ceo now leads kipp new jersey which was formed in 2013 to manage team and other nontraditional schools in new jersey he told the authority in the letter that the city had targeted the site for residential redevelopment but a weak economy prompted a change of plans the owner of the land was a real estate entrepreneur david berkowitz who agreed to sell it to a company related to team berkowitz and a partner ian mount created a new company to manage the charter school project ryan hill who now leads kipp new jersey in a letter proposing the deal he made as team academy s ceo to create the 63 20 nonprofit corporation nca facility we understand this structure might be unfamiliar quote icon the deal centers around a relatively obscure irs rule that allows some nonprofits to issue bonds on behalf of government agencies the irs requires such corporations to be controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans with the public charter school s rent former city employee speaking on the condition of anonymity we were focused on the school being built i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building quote icon a school building to pass briefly through public hands the quick transfer of the building was mentioned in multiple documents leslie anderson the executive director of the state redevelopment authority told the board s agency in a memo that the authority would take control of the building and immediately transfer ownership of the school facility to friends of team booker s administration also approved the building being immediately transferred to the friends in a redevelopment agreement signed by stefan pryor then newark s director of housing and economic development timothy lizura who was president of the economic development authority at the time said his agency played only a small part in financing the project he directed questions about the deal to the redevelopment authority anderson the head of that agency declined to comment pryor who later became connecticut s education commissioner and is now rhode island s secretary of commerce did not respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private for profit company called pinkhulahoop1 llc was created to own this team academy building at 229 18th ave in newark it cost 36 million to renovate kevin r wexler northjersey com a complex deal leaves taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16 million on a 1 million investment documents show the money is being distributed as dividends experts say this is an unusual arrangement i ve done this 25 years and i ve never heard the word dividends

the financing on the 18th avenue school but they said in a statement that the charter school is paying a reasonable sum to rent a state of the art facility team now pays nearly 2 million annually in rent on the building and is responsible for its upkeep the public charter school also picks up about 330 000 in annual property taxes because pinkhulahoop1 which owns the property was created as a for profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for

charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around and give it to another private group with ties to the school called the friends of team here s how the arrangement came together
cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings

dollars in taxpayer money to private companies that control real estate two of the state s largest charter school operators kipp new jersey and uncommon schools have been permitted by the state to monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator

financing or lease agreements before they are signed they don t monitor the associated groups that own real estate for charter schools and new jersey has issued more than 800 million in bonds to construct purchase and renovate charter school buildings without any agency considering who will own them or how much the public will pay in rent dwight berg an economist who has worked on charter school facility deals around the country said new jersey s law doesn t make any sense and has pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities to leasing i m sure that s put a lot of money in private landlords said berg who has been a financial adviser on kipp new jersey projects he advocates for changing the statute to make it easier for charter schools to borrow and buy property and control their own destiny some charter operators have created networks of private entities both for profit and nonprofit to finance and own the real estate that their schools rent with public funds many large projects were at least partly funded with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid at the direction of gov chris christie s administration joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law said private ownership of charter school buildings creates a money making situation that lawmakers didn t foresee we envisioned paying rent he said but we didn t envision that then there would be the pyramid built upon that state law required an independent evaluation of the charter school program after five years but doria now the dean of education at st peter s university said it was never done the administration of gov phil murphy kicked off a review in october under the law the involvement of private entities in the operation and financial support of charter schools is among a dozen areas to be reviewed former nj assembly speaker explains state s vision for charter schools former nj assembly speaker joseph doria talks about the original vision for charter schools in the state kevin r wexler northjersey charter operators point out that most of those private groups are nonprofits and maintain they are keeping facility costs down but many details about them are not available to the public because support companies are private it s often impossible to see routine information such as interest rates on loans debt on school facilities or what happens to the money once it leaves the public charter school that lack of transparency is compounded by charter operators who have declined to discuss the details of complicated financial deals that leave property in private hands indefinitely bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing we left these organizations to come up with a way to gain access to properties and to retrofit and renovate urban facilities in expensive areas and it costs a lot of money so they had to get creative quote icon

new jersey which is paid millions of dollars to run team academy said it has determined it is in the best interest of our students and programs to allow the utmost flexibility and consideration of the regulatory parameters at the time to make those decisions when the time comes but that s not always the case quick sale a newark charter school changes hands team academy s leaders orchestrated a complicated arrangement more than eight years ago to make sure a 22 million high school building ends up in private hands however a federal tax rule requires the building to be owned by the public once the bonds issued to finance it have been repaid the deal was sanctioned by the new jersey redevelopment authority and by the administration of newark s mayor cory booker presidential candidate and new jersey s junior u s senator the building on norfolk street is owned by a private nonprofit company with ties to the charter school that was created to issue bonds for the project under a rarely used irs rule the bonds were purchased by the friends of team another group with ties to the charter documents obtained by northjersey com show property transfers that were scripted years in advance to meet an irs rule eight years from now the building is scheduled to be flipped twice handed off first to the redevelopment authority and then immediately transferred to the friends group by then 30 million in public money would have been invested in a building that is privately owned millions of dollars pass through the friends group and at least a half dozen partner companies annually recent financial documents show that the friends group holds nearly 6 7 million in cash receives millions of dollars in development fees and controls tens of millions more in federal aid and grants

community and the parents they ve become much more institutional much more corporate than the original concept of the legislation quote icon team academy hasn t used the building in years for a while it subleased the structure to another charter school for nearly 1 million annually about three times what it had been paying in rent passing any earnings to its landlord the building is now empty but team continues to use taxpayer money to pay its 300 000 annual rent and as much as 50 000 in landlord and other fees a sign on a parking lot fence indicates the building will be used by team in the next school year the issue of ownership becomes more pressing as charter schools grow the largest educate thousands of students and plan to expand that means that the charter school affiliates and support groups will over time control more and more property funded by taxpayers doria the former legislator said lawmakers never anticipated that many of new jersey s charter schools would have more than 500 students each this year the state expected 30 charter schools to have more than 500 students and 13 to have enrollments exceeding 1 000 joseph doria a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey he is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university he is seen here in his jersey city office kevin r wexler

embraced charters his successor mayor ras baraka has called for a halt to their expansion in the city both declined to be interviewed team academy is expected to double in size to nearly 8 000 students within three years its private partner groups own five buildings including a former public school and other property team recently purchased its first building a former essex county school but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale bond documents show it intended to finance the purchase with a loan from the friends group the friends group would repay that money by collecting rent from the public charter school which is funded by taxpayers a timeline of events leading to the construction of a team academy building on norfolk street in newark showing how a

thomas contracted to buy them from the city but the friends instead allowed them to be sold to a for profit developer the developer then sold them to the friends after about two months in the case of one building and just shy of a year later in the other for a 150 percent price hike fees of almost 6 4 million accounted for much of the increase rent from charter schools funded by taxpayers will cover the cost of the sale gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail quote icon the group is also in line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership raises a multitude of issues there s the ethical problem of buying private property with public dollars but there s also the way in which it ties the hands of the policy makers said gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury building owner and developers who have renovated properties and strike long term multimillion dollar leases with schools uncommon schools newest north star academy facility located at 571 585 18th ave in newark included the renovation of a building and the construction of a large addition it opened in november 2018 kevin r wexler northjersey com to be sure not all agreements are unfair to the public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with locations in paterson asbury park plainfield and north plainfield college achieve s westervelt avenue school with addition built onto a former catholic school building in north plainfield abbott koloff northjersey com rents in some subleases provided were 10 to 30 percent above what college achieve was scheduled to pay the nonprofit also offers maintenance at a 20 percent markup at the same time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company declined to discuss key details are lacking in publicly available documents on another college achieve property in north plainfield neither the lease nor the sublease provided includes the rent the sublease notes an extra 48 000 a year in fees that college achieve declined to explain and college achieve also would not say if it or the public charter school would cover a 500 000 annual cash collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private

controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans

of the building quote icon a school building to pass briefly through public hands the quick transfer of the building was mentioned in multiple documents leslie anderson the executive director of the state redevelopment authority told the board s agency in a memo that the authority would take control of the building and immediately transfer ownership of the school facility to friends of team booker s administration also approved the building being immediately transferred to the friends in a redevelopment agreement signed by stefan pryor then newark s director of housing and economic

the redevelopment authority anderson the head of that agency declined to comment pryor who later became connecticut s education commissioner and is now rhode island s secretary of commerce did not respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private

taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16 million on a 1 million investment documents show the money is being distributed as dividends experts say this is an unusual arrangement i ve done this 25 years and i ve never heard the word dividends

by team but was not part of the 18th avenue transaction officials at kipp new jersey which is paid to run team and is one of the state s largest operators of charter schools also declined to discuss the financing on the 18th avenue school but they said in a statement that the charter school is paying a reasonable sum to rent a state of the art facility team now pays nearly 2 million annually in rent on the building and is responsible for its upkeep the public charter school also picks up about 330 000 in annual property taxes because pinkhulahoop1 which owns the property was created as a for profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for some other purpose documents indicate that the rent continues to rise dan adan who has served on kingston s and team s boards in an email i can attest that our real estate and associated financing

charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around

facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator

has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury

public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school

commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year

donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private owner nca facility another charter school briefly rented the building last year but it s been vacant since november for now team academy continues to pay 350 000 in annual rent on an empty building this building at 18 norfolk street in newark is owned by a group that supports team academy the charter school isn t using the building this school year but continues to pay rent kevin r wexler

exclusive redeveloper of the norfolk street property adding that this item is time sensitive the measure passed unanimously two weeks later a team administrator explained plans to finance the 22 million norfolk street project in a letter to the state redevelopment authority dated that october ryan hill then team academy s ceo now leads kipp new jersey which was formed in 2013 to manage team and other nontraditional schools in new jersey he told the authority in the letter that the city had targeted the site for residential redevelopment but a weak economy prompted a change of plans the owner of the land was a real estate entrepreneur david berkowitz who agreed to sell it to a company related to team berkowitz and a partner ian mount created a new company to manage the charter school project ryan hill who now leads kipp new jersey in a letter proposing the deal he made as team academy s ceo to create the 63 20 nonprofit corporation nca facility we understand this structure might be unfamiliar quote icon the deal centers around a relatively obscure irs rule that allows some nonprofits to issue bonds on behalf of government agencies the irs requires such corporations to be controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans with the public charter school s rent former city employee speaking on the condition of anonymity we were focused on the school being built i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building quote icon a school building to pass briefly through public hands the quick transfer of the building was mentioned in multiple documents leslie anderson the executive director of the state redevelopment authority told the board s agency in a memo that the authority would take control of the building and immediately transfer ownership of the school facility to friends of team booker s administration also approved the building being immediately transferred to the friends in a redevelopment agreement signed by stefan pryor then newark s director of housing and economic development timothy lizura who was president of the economic development authority at the time said his agency played only a small part in financing the project he directed questions about the deal to the redevelopment authority anderson the head of that agency declined to comment pryor who later became connecticut s education commissioner and is now rhode island s secretary of commerce did not respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private for profit company called pinkhulahoop1 llc was created to own this team academy building at 229 18th ave in newark it cost 36 million to renovate kevin r wexler northjersey com a complex deal leaves taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16

profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for

international spillovers of monetary policy and financial stability concerns speech by luis de guindos vice president of the ecb at the ecb and its watchers xx conference frankfurt am main 27 march 2019 introduction it is a great pleasure for me to speak at this year s ecb watchers conference given the topic of this session i will start by referring to our recent findings on international spillovers of monetary policy and the related financial stability concerns for the euro area i will then focus on our financial stability assessment at the present juncture in doing so i will briefly refer to an analytical tool we have employed to monitor and assess the banking system s resilience globalisation has not only caused inflation and output to become increasingly synchronised across countries equity prices and financing conditions have become more synchronised too most of this synchronisation stems from common global shocks but the effects of international spillovers of monetary policy are less obvious in my talk today i will touch upon issues surrounding these international spillovers and whether they are of concern for the financial stability of the euro area in a globalised and financially integrated world spillovers from the monetary policy of one country to other economies are unavoidable we can identify at least three international transmission channels the aggregate demand channel through which monetary policy affects domestic demand and thus the demand for foreign goods the exchange rate competitiveness channel through which monetary policy affects the exchange rate meaning it changes the price of domestic goods relative to foreign goods the financial channel through which monetary policy affects domestic financial conditions when there are strong financial connections between countries these conditions may change abroad as well from these transmission channels let me focus on the financial channel for the remainder of my talk financial spillovers from us monetary policy to the euro area measuring international spillovers is not easy because global shocks lead to economies moving in a synchronised manner for reasons unrelated to monetary policy in line with previous evidence recent ecb research identifies large financial spillovers from us monetary policy to global financial conditions including euro area financial conditions more specifically over the course of one month monetary policy tightening by the federal reserve system drives up euro area corporate bond spreads just as much as us corporate bond spreads it also triggers declines in euro area stock markets of a similar magnitude to the declines in us stock markets however the financial spillovers from ecb monetary policy to us bond spreads or to foreign equity markets are found to be less impactful this asymmetry in the international impact of us monetary policy and euro area monetary policy is rooted in the dominant role of the us dollar in global financial markets furthermore our analysis shows that there are only limited spillovers from the monetary policy of the federal reserve to euro area inflation and output this suggests that ecb monetary policy actions are by and large able to shield the euro area economy from spillovers from us monetary policy but undoubtedly there is evidence that us monetary policy is a driver of a global financial cycle in step with such a financial cycle the risks to euro area financial stability can change as well current financial stability concerns in the euro area as you know our characterisation of the main risks to euro area financial stability has remained broadly unchanged over the recent years we see four main risks the most prominent risk stems from the possibility of a disorderly increase of global risk premia the second risk is related to renewed debt sustainability concerns for sovereign debt in particular the third risk is that banks intermediation capacity may be hampered by their continued low profitability finally we are of the opinion that possible liquidity strains in the investment fund sector constitute a growing risk all four risks are intertwined and would have if they were to materialise the potential to be mutually reinforcing in 2018 a growing economy and improved banking sector resilience were important positive factors supporting financial stability now however the assessment is affected by a weakening economic growth outlook for the euro area in the latest ecb staff macroeconomic projections expected real gdp growth was revised downwards and the outlook continues to be viewed as tilted to the downside on account of persistent uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets in my view the deterioration in the growth outlook increases the risk of financial instability particularly via two main channels first low economic growth raises concerns about sovereign debt sustainability and second it further dampens profitability prospects for the banking sector a weaker growth trajectory will challenge euro area sovereigns ongoing deleveraging low growth and elevated public sector debt also leave a number of euro area countries vulnerable to higher funding costs furthermore threats stemming from rising protectionism around the globe and high political uncertainty within europe may amplify potential corrections of sovereign bond risk premia these risks notwithstanding market based indicators of stress in the euro area sovereign bond markets have remained relatively contained in 2019 and debt sustainability concerns have remained country specific looking ahead as growth prospects moderate it is imperative that fiscal buffers are rebuilt in countries where government debt still is too high a prolonged period of low economic growth also poses challenges for euro area banks over the past ten years following the great financial crisis funding strains and subsequently hampered bank intermediation capacity related to low bank profitability have figured prominently in our risk assessments the low growth and inflation environment will probably exert downward pressure on the risk free rate component of bonds across maturities as a result profitability stemming from the maturity transformation business may come under renewed pressure not least as retail household deposits tend to be bound at zero furthermore should downside risks to the economic outlook materialise higher loan loss provisions may further compress bank profitability accommodative monetary policy has greatly supported bank profitability in past years in fact conventional and unconventional measures have improved the quality of credit overall thereby reducing provisioning needs our measures have also increased the demand for loans which has more than offset the negative effect of compressed margins furthermore structural factors are also weighing heavily on euro area banks profitability in an environment where cyclical factors may exert further downward pressure on bank profitability banks would need to step up their efforts to overcome structural challenges such measures may include cost reductions including lower staffing costs and streamlining of branch networks enhanced digitalisation implying initial one off large scale investments revenue diversification and the reduction of the stock of non performing loans in the six countries where levels are still high a number of regulatory and policy measures could help to improve the institutional setting in which the banking sector operates and facilitate banks efforts to adjust their business models such measures should include completing the banking union in particular the establishment of a european deposit insurance scheme the subsequent removal of the remaining non harmonised national options and discretions and making progress with the capital markets union this could foster further consolidation including across borders and address the problem of overcapacity in the euro area banking system assessing the financial stability of the euro area beyond regular monitoring activities financial stability analysis entails assessing the impact on the financial system of risks materialising including risks related to international spillovers such assessments can also help inform the calibration of possible appropriate macroprudential policy responses the stress testing framework is an important analytical tool to quantitatively assess financial system vulnerabilities and risks stress testing exercises of the banking sector assess the sector s resilience and how it performs under adverse circumstances thus providing a measure of the severity of these risks individual bank results provide further information about banks potential capital needs stress tests can therefore show how the financial system will react when risks such as those relating to spillovers materialise in order to enhance its stress testing capacity the ecb has invested in an analytical framework that not only tracks the resilience of the banking sector but also accounts for how it interacts with and feeds back in to the economy as a whole this framework complements the eu wide stress tests conducted under the aegis of the european banking authority eba which are predominantly microprudential in nature our so called macroprudential stress testing loosens the assumption that banks balance sheets are constant as banks are hit by say negative spillover effects from the global environment they may react by deleveraging their loan books this type of stress testing also accounts for what implications banks reactions would have for the real economy in other words macroprudential stress tests consider the adverse credit supply shock that may lead to an amplification of the macroeconomic effects of the global shock which in turn could further damage banks balance sheets by modelling the negative feedback loop between the banking sector and the real economy beyond the first round of shocks we believe the exercise becomes more realistic a macroprudential stress test of banks directly supervised by the ecb using the baseline and adverse scenarios of the recent eba stress test confirmed the general resilience of the euro area banking system results however point to an additional fall in gdp of 1 6 across the euro area on top of the gdp shocks of the adverse scenario over the three year horizon this stress testing framework can also inform the calibration of macroprudential policies with the aim of limiting unintended spillovers to other parts of the financial system or the real economy in the spirit of pre emptive macroprudential policy these exercises can emphasise the need for the timely build up of capital buffers which can then be used to absorb losses when risks materialise before they affect growth and employment finally the stress testing framework can be used to analyse the spillover effects of the macroprudential policies themselves for instance another finding of the framework is that capital constrained banks are more likely to reduce their foreign exposures than their domestic ones we are particularly concerned about spillover effects of macroprudential policies within the euro area because the build up of a capital buffer in one country should to the extent possible not impair the functioning of financial intermediation in other euro area countries conclusion let me conclude by emphasising that in a globalised and financially integrated world the euro area is not immune to spillovers from other regions in particular to shocks emanating from the united states but we are convinced that we have the appropriate policy tools to largely shield the euro area economy and financial system from such spillovers monetary policy and macroprudential policy have different objectives and therefore different sets of policy tools cyclical factors such as compressed interest margins pose challenges to banks operating environment but the gains have so far greatly offset the losses in turn euro area banks need to address their structural fragilities which partially explain the very low price to book ratios of euro area banks when compared with their international peers

cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings that are paid for with millions of dollars in public money but owned by private groups inflated rents high interest rates and unexplained costs borne by taxpayers and tax dollars used to pay rents that far exceed the debt on some school buildings this is the world of charter school real estate in new jersey where public money can disappear in a maze of intertwined companies where businesses and investors can turn a profit at taxpayer expense and where decisions about millions in tax dollars are made privately with little public input and little to no oversight by multiple state agencies what is a charter school what exactly is a charter school let s break down the basics what they are where they came from and how they work paul wood jr northjersey com more than two decades into the state s experiment to create charter schools which were conceived to provide residents with choices and to spur innovation serious flaws in the design of the system have led to the diversion of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to private companies that control real estate two of the state s largest charter school operators kipp new jersey and uncommon schools have been permitted by the state to monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law we envisioned paying rent but we didn t envision that then there would be the pyramid built upon that quote icon we re putting a lot of public dollars into the acquisition of assets for private hands said bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing all of these crazy funky convoluted relationships and kind of specially crafted third party organizations are really all a function of just bad policy we left these organizations to come up with a way to gain access to properties and to retrofit and renovate urban facilities in expensive areas he added and it costs a lot of money so they had to get creative what that means is that millions of your tax dollars are being siphoned off by private interests to pay for buildings often without your knowledge that you don t own northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents including lease property and financing records state issued bond sales and audits involving a cross section of charter schools around the state the findings raise troubling questions about waste the use of public money and accountability in a system that receives some 760 million annually from traditional public school districts and educates more than 50 000 students another 35 000 are on waiting lists excerpts from a memo sent by new jersey redevelopment authority head leslie anderson telling the agency s board about plans to take ownership of a building to meet a tax rule and then immediately transferring it to the private friends of team illustration by parisa amini usa today network among the findings charters are using tax dollars to pay rents that far exceed building costs some charter schools will pay 15 to 80 percent more in rent over a period of years or decades than is needed to pay off the debt on their buildings the money flows out of public coffers to private groups created to support the schools some charter schools will pay 15 to 80 percent more in rent over a period of years or decades than is needed to pay off the debt on their buildings the money flows out of public coffers to private groups created to support the schools complex transactions hide profits while taxpayers pick up the tab financing for one project involved a half dozen companies at least as many loans and two types of tax credits resulting in millions of dollars moving from public to private hands with no accountability financing for one project involved a half dozen companies at least as many loans and two types of tax credits resulting in millions of dollars moving from public to private hands with no accountability charter school operators have exploited a loophole in a federal aid program they are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from a program that was meant to spur public school construction but doesn t require the properties to be owned by the public some of the methods used to tap into that aid are now being reviewed by the irs which could put some aid in jeopardy they are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from a program that was meant to spur public school construction but doesn t require the properties to be owned by the public some of the methods used to tap into that aid are now being reviewed by the irs which could put some aid in jeopardy charter schools pay interest rates and fees experts described as very high damaging and even predatory some schools are covering interest only mortgages with rates that grow each year swelling in one case to more than 16 percent for another school building 25 million in interest would be paid over two decades and the 10 5 million initially borrowed for its construction will still be owed and fees to get out of the deals early can reach millions of dollars some schools are covering interest only mortgages with rates that grow each year swelling in one case to more

the deals early can reach millions of dollars excessive and unexplained fees are hidden in leases and rents one nonprofit charter school management company rents properties and then leases them to schools charging as much as 30 percent above what it pays over the lease term and tacking on other costs in another case two charter schools are paying rent to cover the purchase of a pair of buildings that increased in price by more than 150 percent including millions of dollars in fees paid to the seller one nonprofit charter school management company rents properties and then leases

prices one vacant lot was purchased by a private group that supports a charter school the same day it sold the land to a subsidiary for nearly six times what it paid adding nearly 2 million to the debt that taxpayers are covering in rent one vacant lot was purchased by a private group that supports a charter school the same day it sold the land to a subsidiary for nearly six times what it paid adding nearly 2 million to the debt that taxpayers are covering in rent there is little public scrutiny and lax oversight from multiple state agencies state education officials don t review building financing or lease agreements before they are signed they don t monitor the associated groups that own real estate for charter schools and new jersey has issued more than 800 million in bonds to construct purchase and renovate charter school buildings without any agency considering who will own them or how much the public will pay in rent dwight berg an economist who has worked on charter school facility deals around the country said new jersey s law doesn t make any sense and has pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities to leasing i m sure that s put a lot of money in private landlords said berg who has been a financial adviser on kipp new jersey projects he advocates for changing the statute to make it easier for charter schools to borrow and buy property and control their own destiny some charter operators have created networks of private entities both for profit and nonprofit to finance and own the real estate that their schools rent with public funds many large projects were at least partly funded with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid at the direction of gov chris christie s administration joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law said private ownership of charter school buildings creates a money making situation that lawmakers didn t foresee we envisioned paying rent he said but we didn t envision that then there would be the pyramid built upon that state law required an independent evaluation of the charter school program after five years but doria now the dean of education at st peter s university said it was never done the administration of gov phil murphy kicked off a review in october under the law the involvement of private entities in the operation and financial support of charter schools is among a dozen areas to be reviewed former nj assembly speaker explains state s vision for charter schools former nj assembly speaker joseph doria talks about the original vision for charter schools in the state kevin r wexler northjersey charter operators point out that most of those private groups are nonprofits and maintain they are keeping facility costs down but many details about them are not available to the public because support companies are private it s often impossible to see routine information such as interest rates on loans debt on school facilities or what happens to the money once it leaves the public charter school that lack of transparency is compounded by charter operators who have declined to discuss the details of complicated financial deals that leave property in private hands indefinitely bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing we left these organizations to come up with a way to gain access to properties and to retrofit and renovate urban facilities in expensive areas and it costs a lot of money so they had to get creative quote icon board members of the private groups who have included bankers finance experts and lawyers also declined to speak with reporters among them were tim carden a financier and a member of gov brendan byrne s cabinet and mikie sherrill a democrat who was elected to congress in november both were members of multiple boards that rent buildings to one large newark charter school team academy jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools said the public should own school buildings that are funded with taxpayer money it s public schools public dollars and public kids he said officials at kipp new jersey a regional offshoot of the national kipp foundation said they don t determine in advance what the ownership of a building will be after the debt is paid off kipp new jersey which is paid millions of dollars to run team academy said it has determined it is in the best interest of our students and programs to allow the utmost flexibility and consideration of the regulatory parameters at the time to make those decisions when the time comes but that s not always the case quick sale a newark charter school changes hands team academy s leaders orchestrated a complicated arrangement more than eight years ago to make sure a 22 million high school building ends up in private hands however a federal tax rule requires the building to be owned by the public once the bonds issued to finance it have been repaid the deal was sanctioned by the new jersey redevelopment authority and by the administration of newark s mayor cory booker presidential candidate and new jersey s junior u s senator the building on norfolk street is owned by a private nonprofit company with ties to the charter school that was created to issue bonds for the project under a rarely used irs rule the bonds were purchased by the friends of team another group with ties to the charter documents obtained by northjersey com show property transfers that were scripted years in advance to meet an irs rule eight years from now the building is scheduled to be flipped twice handed off first to the redevelopment authority and then immediately transferred to the friends group by then 30 million in public money would have been invested in a building that is privately owned millions of dollars pass through the friends group and at least a half dozen partner companies annually recent financial documents show that the friends group holds nearly 6 7 million in cash receives millions of dollars in development fees and controls tens of millions more in federal aid and grants joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law we envisioned that charter schools were going to be community based to reflect the needs of the community and the parents they ve become much more institutional much more corporate than the original concept of the legislation quote icon team academy hasn t used the building in years for a while it subleased the structure to another charter school for nearly 1 million annually about three times what it had been paying in rent passing any earnings to its landlord the building is now empty but team continues to use taxpayer money to pay its 300 000 annual rent and as much as 50 000 in landlord and other fees a sign on a parking lot fence indicates the building will be used by team in the next school year the issue of ownership becomes more pressing as charter schools grow the largest educate thousands of students and plan to expand that means that the charter school affiliates and support groups will over time control more and more property funded by taxpayers doria the former legislator said lawmakers never anticipated that many of new jersey s charter schools would have more than 500 students each this year the state expected 30 charter schools to have more than 500 students and 13 to have enrollments exceeding 1 000 joseph doria a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey he is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university he is seen here in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com we didn t envision organizations like kipp coming in he said we envisioned that charter schools were going to be community based to reflect the needs of the community and the parents they ve become much more institutional much more corporate than the original concept of the legislation about a third of newark s students attend charter schools and that number is rising while booker embraced charters his successor mayor ras baraka has called for a halt to their expansion in the city both declined to be interviewed team academy is expected to double in size to nearly 8 000 students within three years its private partner groups own five buildings including a former public school and other property team recently purchased its first building a former essex county school but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale bond documents show it intended to finance the purchase with a loan from the friends group the friends group would repay that money by collecting rent from the public charter school which is funded by taxpayers a timeline of events leading to the construction of a team academy building on norfolk street in newark showing how a government agency agreed to pass it to a private company uncommon schools the state s other large charter operator is paid millions of dollars to run north star academy which has been approved to expand to 7 300 students by 2020 one of its newest facilities is six stories and 162 000 square feet and it cost about 69 million north star is slated to pay more than 3 million a year to rent it in all companies tied to uncommon own seven buildings that they rent to the school marion p thomas charter school in newark which enrolled 1 372 pupils last year has been approved to expand to 2 250 students by fall 2020 its supporting organizations own six school buildings three of which were recently purchased two of those buildings were former newark public schools the friends of marion p thomas contracted to buy them from the city but the friends instead allowed them to be sold to a for profit developer the developer then sold them to the friends after about two months in the case of one building and just shy of a year later in the other for a 150 percent price hike fees of almost 6 4 million accounted for much of the increase rent from charter schools funded by taxpayers will cover the cost of the sale gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail quote icon the group is also in line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership raises a multitude of issues there s the ethical problem of buying private property with public dollars but there s also the way in which it ties the hands of the policy makers said gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury building owner and developers who have renovated properties and strike long term multimillion dollar leases with schools uncommon schools newest north star academy facility located at 571 585 18th ave in newark included the renovation of a building and the construction of a large addition it opened in november 2018 kevin r wexler northjersey com to be sure not all agreements are unfair to the public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with locations in paterson asbury park plainfield and north plainfield college achieve s westervelt avenue school with addition built onto a former catholic school building in north plainfield abbott koloff northjersey com rents in some subleases provided were 10 to 30 percent above what college achieve was scheduled to pay the nonprofit also offers maintenance at a 20 percent markup at the same time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company declined to discuss key details are lacking in publicly available documents on another college achieve property in north plainfield neither the lease nor the sublease provided includes the rent the sublease notes an extra 48 000 a year in fees that college achieve declined to explain and college achieve also would not say if it or the public charter school would cover a 500 000 annual cash collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private owner nca facility another charter school briefly rented the building last year but it s been vacant since november for now team academy continues to pay 350 000 in annual rent on an empty building

be unfamiliar quote icon the deal centers around a relatively obscure irs rule that allows some nonprofits to issue bonds on behalf of government agencies the irs requires such corporations to be controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans

of the building quote icon a school building to pass briefly through public hands the quick transfer of the building was mentioned in multiple documents leslie anderson the executive director of the state redevelopment authority told the board s agency in a memo that the authority would take control of the building and immediately transfer ownership of the school facility to friends of team booker s administration also approved the building being immediately transferred to the friends in a redevelopment agreement signed by stefan pryor then newark s director of housing and economic development timothy lizura who was president of the economic development authority at the time said his agency played only a small part in financing the project he directed questions about the deal to the redevelopment authority anderson the head of that agency declined to comment pryor who later became connecticut s education commissioner and is now rhode island s secretary of commerce did not respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private

taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends

profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the

charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around and give it to another private group with ties to the school called the friends of team here s how the arrangement came together
cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings that are paid for with millions of dollars in public money but owned by private groups inflated rents high interest rates and unexplained costs borne by taxpayers and tax dollars used to pay rents that far exceed the debt on some school buildings this is the world of charter school real estate in new jersey where public money can disappear in a maze of intertwined companies where businesses and investors can turn a profit at taxpayer expense and where decisions about millions in tax dollars are made privately with little public input and little to no oversight by multiple state agencies what is a charter school what exactly is a charter school let s break down the basics what they are where they came from and how they work paul wood jr northjersey com more than two decades into the state s experiment to create charter schools which were conceived to provide residents with choices and to spur innovation serious flaws in the design of the system have led to the diversion of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to private companies that control real estate two of the state s largest charter school operators kipp new jersey and uncommon schools have been permitted by the state to monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law we envisioned paying rent but we didn t envision that then there would be the pyramid built upon that quote icon we re putting a lot of public dollars into the acquisition of assets for private hands said bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing all of these crazy funky convoluted relationships and kind of specially crafted third party organizations are really all a function of just bad policy we left these organizations to come up with a way to gain access to properties and to retrofit and renovate urban facilities in expensive areas he added and it costs a lot of money so they had to get creative what that means is that millions of your tax dollars are being siphoned off

adding nearly 2 million to the debt that taxpayers are covering in rent there is little public scrutiny and lax oversight from multiple state agencies state education officials don t review building financing or lease agreements before they are signed they don t monitor the associated groups that own real estate for charter schools and new jersey has issued more than 800 million in bonds to construct purchase and renovate charter school buildings without any agency considering who will own them or how much the public will pay in rent dwight berg an economist who has worked on charter school facility deals around the country said new jersey s law doesn t make any sense and has pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities to leasing i m sure that s put a lot of money in private landlords said berg who has been a financial adviser on kipp new jersey projects he advocates for changing the statute to make it easier for charter schools to borrow and buy property and control their own destiny some charter operators have created networks of private entities both for profit and nonprofit to finance and own the real estate that their schools rent with public funds many large projects were at least partly funded with hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid at the direction of gov chris christie s administration joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law said private ownership of charter school buildings creates a money making situation that lawmakers didn t foresee we envisioned paying rent he said but we didn t envision that then there would be the pyramid built upon that state law required an independent evaluation of the charter school program after five years but doria now the dean of education at st peter s university said it was never done the administration of gov phil murphy kicked off a review in october under the law the involvement of private entities in the operation and financial support of charter schools is among a dozen areas to be reviewed former nj assembly speaker explains state s vision for charter schools former nj assembly speaker joseph doria talks about the original vision for charter schools in the state kevin r wexler northjersey charter operators point out that most of those private groups are nonprofits and maintain they are keeping facility costs down but many details about them are not available to the public because support companies are private it s often impossible to see routine information such as interest rates on loans debt on school facilities or what happens to the money once it leaves the public charter school that lack of transparency is compounded by charter operators who have declined to discuss the details of complicated financial deals that leave property in private hands indefinitely bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing we left these organizations to come up with a way to gain access to properties and to retrofit and renovate urban facilities in expensive areas and it costs a lot of money so they had to get creative quote icon

new jersey which is paid millions of dollars to run team academy said it has determined it is in the best interest of our students and programs to allow the utmost flexibility and consideration of the regulatory parameters at the time to make those decisions when the time comes but that s not always the case quick sale a newark charter school changes hands team academy s leaders orchestrated a complicated arrangement more than eight years ago to make sure a 22 million high school building ends up in private hands however a federal tax rule requires the building to be owned by the public once the bonds issued to finance it have been repaid the deal was sanctioned by the new jersey redevelopment authority and by the administration of newark s mayor cory booker presidential candidate and new jersey s junior u s senator the building on norfolk street is owned by a private nonprofit company with ties to the charter school that was created to issue bonds for the project under a rarely used irs rule the bonds were purchased by the friends of team another group with ties to the charter documents obtained by northjersey com show property transfers that were scripted years in advance to meet an irs rule eight years from now the building is scheduled to be flipped twice handed off first to the redevelopment authority and then immediately transferred to the friends group by then 30 million in public money would have been invested in a building that is privately owned millions of dollars pass through the friends group and at least a half dozen partner companies annually recent financial documents show that the friends group holds nearly 6 7 million in cash receives millions of dollars in development fees and controls tens of millions more in federal aid and grants

community and the parents they ve become much more institutional much more corporate than the original concept of the legislation quote icon team academy hasn t used the building in years for a while it subleased the structure to another charter school for nearly 1 million annually about three times what it had been paying in rent passing any earnings to its landlord the building is now empty but team continues to use taxpayer money to pay its 300 000 annual rent and as much as 50 000 in landlord and other fees a sign on a parking lot fence indicates the building will be used by team in the next school year the issue of ownership becomes more pressing as charter schools grow the largest educate thousands of students and plan to expand that means that the charter school affiliates and support groups will over time control more and more property funded by taxpayers doria the former legislator said lawmakers never anticipated that many of new jersey s charter schools would have more than 500 students each this year the state expected 30 charter schools to have more than 500 students and 13 to have enrollments exceeding 1 000 joseph doria a former state senator who was a sponsor

students within three years its private partner groups own five buildings including a former public school and other property team recently purchased its first building a former essex county school but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale bond documents show it intended to finance the purchase with a loan from the friends group the friends group would repay that money by

students by fall 2020 its supporting organizations own six school buildings three of which were recently purchased two of those buildings were former newark public schools the friends of marion p thomas contracted to buy them from the city but the friends instead allowed them to be sold to a for profit developer the developer then sold them to the friends after about two months in the case of one building and just shy of a year later in the other for a 150 percent price hike fees of almost 6 4 million accounted for much of the increase rent from charter schools funded by taxpayers will cover the cost of the sale gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail quote icon the group is also in line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership raises a multitude of issues there s the ethical problem of buying private property with public dollars but there s also the way in which it ties the hands of the policy makers said gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury building owner and developers who have renovated properties and strike long term multimillion dollar leases with schools uncommon schools newest north star academy facility located at 571 585 18th ave in newark included the renovation of a building and the construction of a large addition it opened in november 2018 kevin r wexler northjersey com to be sure not all agreements are unfair to the public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with locations in paterson asbury park plainfield and north plainfield college achieve s westervelt avenue school with addition built onto a former catholic school building in north plainfield abbott koloff northjersey com rents in some subleases provided were 10 to 30 percent above what college achieve was scheduled to pay the nonprofit also offers maintenance at a 20 percent markup at the same time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company declined to discuss key details are lacking in publicly available documents on another college achieve property in north plainfield neither the lease nor the sublease provided includes the rent the sublease notes an extra 48 000 a year in fees that college achieve declined to explain and college achieve also would not say if it or the public charter school would cover a 500 000 annual cash collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private owner nca facility another charter school briefly rented the building last year but it s been vacant since november for now team academy continues to pay 350 000 in annual rent on an empty building

controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans

respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private

taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16

not speak with reporters and did not answer questions that her staff requested be submitted in writing sherrill and adan also served on the board of ashland schools inc which owns two buildings used by team but was not part of the 18th avenue transaction officials at kipp new jersey which is paid to run team and is one of the state s largest operators of charter schools also declined to discuss the financing on the 18th avenue school but they said in a statement that the charter school is paying a reasonable sum to rent a state of the art facility team now pays nearly 2 million annually in rent on the building and is responsible for its upkeep the public charter school also picks up about 330 000 in annual property taxes because pinkhulahoop1 which owns the property was created as a for profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for some other purpose documents indicate that the rent continues to rise dan adan who has served on kingston s and team s boards in an email i can attest that our real estate and associated financing

charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around and give it to another private group with ties to the school called the friends of team here s how the arrangement came together
cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings

monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator

the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of

has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the

nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter

million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private

be unfamiliar quote icon the deal centers around a relatively obscure irs rule that allows some nonprofits to issue bonds on behalf of government agencies the irs requires such corporations to be controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans with the public charter school s rent former city employee speaking on the condition of anonymity we were focused on the school being built i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building quote icon a school building to pass briefly through public hands the quick transfer of the building was mentioned in multiple documents leslie anderson the executive director of the state redevelopment authority told the board s agency in a memo that the authority would take control of the building and immediately transfer ownership of the school facility to friends of team booker s administration also approved the building being immediately transferred to the friends in a redevelopment agreement signed by stefan pryor then newark s director of housing and economic development timothy lizura who was president of the economic development authority at the time said his agency played only a small part in financing the project he directed questions about the deal to the redevelopment authority anderson the head of that agency declined to comment pryor who later became connecticut s education commissioner and is now rhode island s secretary of commerce did not respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private for profit company called pinkhulahoop1 llc was created to own this team academy building at 229 18th ave in newark it cost 36 million to renovate kevin r wexler northjersey com a complex deal leaves taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16

profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for

that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark

background foreign investment what is the prevailing attitude towards foreign investment switzerland welcomes and actively encourages foreign investment foreign investment is promoted at federal and state cantonal levels and investors can often benefit from tax and financial incentives domestic debates concerning political and economic issues typically include discussion of potential impacts on the attractiveness of switzerland as a location for international corporate headquarters and other inbound foreign investment corporations domiciled in switzerland also have a long standing tradition of investing considerable amounts abroad what are the main sectors for foreign investment in the state more than 85 per cent of foreign investment in switzerland is in the services sector with finance and holding companies accounting for more than half of the total of all foreign investments switzerland also attracts foreign investment in manufacturing particularly in the chemicals and plastics industry and in precision manufacturing such as electronics power supply equipment optical equipment and watches is there a net inflow or outflow of foreign direct investment for most of the past decade capital outflows from switzerland were on average more than twice as high as capital inflows this changed in 2017 which was marked by a steep decline in outflow and a resulting net inflow of foreign direct investment nevertheless the total capital stock of swiss investment abroad remains approximately 20 per cent higher than foreign investment in switzerland switzerland s high level of direct investment abroad made it as of 2016 the ninth highest direct investor in the world investment agreement legislation describe domestic legislation governing investment agreements with the state or state owned entities from 1963 to 2004 the swiss federal council was entitled to conclude investment agreements between switzerland and other states since 2004 investment agreements are submitted to the swiss parliament for approval the swiss state secretariat for economic affairs seco is responsible for negotiating international investment agreements international legal obligations investment treaties identify and give brief details of the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party also indicating whether they are in force switzerland was the first state after germany to enter into bilateral investment treaties beginning in 1961 since then switzerland has signed more than 120 bilateral investment treaties bits most of which are in force this is the third largest network of such investment treaties after germany and china most recently the bilateral investment treaty between switzerland and guyana entered into force on 2 may 2018 the types of protections provided by swiss bilateral investment treaties are described in questions 19 20 and 21 switzerland signed the energy charter treaty in 1994 which entered into force in 1998 the energy charter treaty grants investors protection for non commercial risks associated with investments in the energy sector and provides an investor state dispute settlement mechanism switzerland has been a member of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd since 1961 and is a party to the code of liberalisation of capital movements and the code of liberalisation of current invisible operations switzerland is thereby committed to abstain from discriminatory practices against foreign investments made by investors from oecd member countries although switzerland has attached a number of reservations to both codes these instruments do not afford direct protection to international investments or legally binding dispute settlement mechanisms likewise switzerland joined the world trade organization as a member in 1995 and is a party to the agreement on trade related investment measures and the general agreement on trade in services however these treaties regulate only certain trade aspects of foreign investments and efforts to broaden their scope to international direct investment have not been successful to date switzerland is also a party to a number of free trade agreements however most of these agreements focus on eliminating barriers to trade investment protection is primarily addressed through switzerland s bilateral investment treaties if applicable indicate whether the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party extend to overseas territories not applicable has the state amended or entered into additional protocols affecting bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which it is a party given the large number of investment treaties to which switzerland is a party and its ongoing efforts to update older treaties the specific treaty or treaties potentially at issue for an investment or dispute should be consulted with respect to their current status including any additional protocols or amendments has the state unilaterally terminated any bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which it is a party no however a number of other states have unilaterally terminated bits with switzerland south africa terminated its bit with switzerland with effect from 1 november 2014 according to the bit its provisions continue to be effective for a further period of 20 years from the date of the bit s termination in respect of investments made or acquired before the date of its termination indonesia terminated its bit with switzerland with effect from 8 april 2016 according to the bit its provisions continue to be effective for the period of validity of investments admitted by the respective state prior to the notification of termination of the bit india also unilaterally terminated its bit with switzerland with effect from 6 april 2017 according to the bit s terms it shall continue to be effective for a further period of 15 years from the date of its termination in respect of investments made or acquired before the date of its termination most recently ecuador terminated its bit with switzerland with effect from 11 september 2018 according to the bit its provisions continue to be effective for a further period of 10 years from the date of the bit s termination in respect of investments made before the date of its termination has the state entered into multiple bilateral or multilateral investment treaties with overlapping membership switzerland is a member state to the energy charter treaty see question 5 a number of other energy charter treaty member states have also entered into bits with switzerland generally these bits apply in addition to and in parallel with the energy charter treaty icsid convention is the state party to the icsid convention yes switzerland signed the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states icsid convention 1965 on 22 september 1967 and the convention entered into force on 14 june 1968 mauritius convention is the state a party to the un convention on transparency in treaty based investor state arbitration mauritius convention yes switzerland signed and ratified the mauritius convention on 27 march 2015 and 18 april 2017 respectively the convention entered into force on 18 october 2017 investment treaty programme does the state have an investment treaty programme as mentioned see questions 1 and 5 switzerland has a long history of recognising the importance of international investments and investment treaties in promoting domestic economic prosperity switzerland through seco continues to update and expand its network of bilateral investment treaties seco also represents switzerland in bodies of international institutions in which multilateral investment treaties have been established regulation of inbound foreign investment government investment promotion programmes does the state have a foreign investment promotion programme switzerland has a sophisticated foreign investment promotion programme encouraging foreign companies to invest or settle in switzerland is a joint undertaking conducted at both federal and cantonal level at the federal level seco is responsible for promoting switzerland as a business location abroad seco has delegated this task to a private non profit association switzerland global enterprise its main responsibilities are to ensure that switzerland presents a consistent image abroad to transmit information between foreign companies and the cantons and to coordinate marketing activities and otherwise foster a cooperative environment for the location of foreign companies in switzerland switzerland global enterprise provides assistance for example in establishing contacts with regional and cantonal investment organisations collaborating with research institutes and universities establishing partnerships with swiss companies in their business sector and organising work and residence permits on a cantonal level investment promotion is coordinated by regional organisations that focus on promoting specific areas within switzerland for example the greater zurich greater geneva berne st gallen bodensee and basle areas these organisations advise and support foreign investors with regard to policies that apply in each swiss canton for example each canton is entitled to attract new investments by promising tax incentives to interested companies by providing companies with financial assistance and providing support with respect to employees infrastructure or real estate applicable domestic laws identify the domestic laws that apply to foreign investors and foreign investment including any requirements of admission or registration of investments except for acquisitions of real estate foreign investments are not subject to any specific admission or registration requirements rather foreign investors are subject to the same legal framework and requirements as domestic investors for example the federal swiss code of obligations governs private contractual relationships corporate law financial reporting and securities law the trading of securities on the stock exchange is also regulated by a federal act additionally foreign investors should be aware of the relevant provisions of federal competition law in switzerland taxation is a shared responsibility of the federal and cantonal authorities therefore different sets of rules govern the taxation of investments on a federal and on a cantonal level a swiss peculiarity is the lex koller this law provides that a foreign national intending to acquire land in switzerland requires an authorisation by the competent cantonal body however there are various exceptions and exclusions to this rule in addition natural persons are subject to federal immigration laws regulating the conditions under which foreign nationals can live and work in switzerland relevant regulatory agency identify the state agency that regulates and promotes inbound foreign investment as mentioned see questions 13 and 14 regulation and promotion of foreign investment takes place at the state and cantonal levels seco is responsible for promotion of inbound foreign investment on the federal level and has delegated this task to the non profit association switzerland global enterprise on a cantonal level the cantonal governments have empowered regional organisations to promote foreign investment in those areas foreign inbound investment is subject to federal laws including those regulating private contracts corporations and competition such laws are enacted by the swiss federal parliament and the swiss federal council is authorised to issue regulations for the implementation of these laws cantonal governments also enjoy broad power to regulate certain aspects of inbound foreign investment including cantonal tax laws and the establishment of incentives to attract investments relevant dispute agency identify the state agency that must be served with process in a dispute with a foreign investor a foreign investor wishing to directly enforce claims for violation of investment treaty obligations would name the swiss confederation as the respondent it is possible to serve the swiss confederation at any federal agency for example the federal department of foreign affairs or the federal department of finance there is no predetermined federal agency responsible for disputes arising out of investment treaties in each case of actual investment disputes the swiss federal council decides which agency to mandate investment treaty practice model bit does the state have a model bit there is no swiss model bit in the sense of an official published model bit however seco maintains a template or working document for internal use in negotiations as this is merely used as a basis for negotiations and is regularly updated caution should be exercised with respect to statements made about the swiss model bit preparatory materials does the state have a central repository of treaty preparatory materials are such materials publicly available all administrative documents of the swiss federal government including diplomatic correspondence are available in the swiss federal archives which are located in berne but searchable online but only after the statutory closure periods have expired these periods run for a minimum of 30 years therefore not all treaty preparatory materials are publicly available parliamentary ratification records can be found in the federal gazette which is available online however from 1963 to 2004 the swiss federal council had sole authority to negotiate and conclude bits so no parliamentary deliberations or ratifications were necessary scope and coverage what is the typical scope of coverage of investment treaties swiss bits typically define the term investor to include natural persons who are citizens of a contracting party legal entities that are incorporated or duly organised under the laws of a contracting party and legal entities that are controlled by citizens of or legal entities that are incorporated or duly organised under the laws of a contracting party more recent bits concluded by switzerland also require that legal entities have real economic activities in the territory of the contracting party to qualify as investors switzerland s addition of the real economic activities requirement was intended to exclude entities without any substance in a contracting party s territory eg mailbox companies from bit coverage therefore a swiss company that merely forwards correspondence to a foreign parent company would have difficulty showing that it conducts real economic activities in switzerland swiss bits usually contain a very broad definition of investment that begins with a general clause stating that the term extends to every kind of asset and then lists several categories by way of example examples include movable and immovable property and other rights in rem shares and participations in companies intellectual property rights and concessions under public law they also include claims to money or to any performance having an economic value however switzerland s most recent bits explicitly exclude claims arising solely out of commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services protections what substantive protections are typically available swiss bits typically provide that investors shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other contracting party and shall not be discriminated against according to the swiss understanding fair and equitable treatment is a reference to an absolute standard rather than a relative and minimum standard of customary international law with respect to the treatment of foreign property unlike bits of some other states swiss bits do not state that the treatment of investors shall not exceed this standard therefore they do not set a ceiling on the fair and equitable standard established under the bit the full protection and security provision is understood to set a standard that is higher than the minimum standard of customary international law swiss bits also guarantee the free transfer of funds related to the investment and include a national treatment clause and a most favoured nation clause switzerland s most recent bits explicitly state that the most favoured nation clause does not extend to dispute resolution mechanisms provided for in other bits concluded by the contracting parties the protection from expropriation contained in swiss bits extends to direct and indirect expropriation especially in newer bits direct expropriation is subject to the explicit requirements that it be enacted for a public purpose in a non discriminatory manner and according to due process of law and that provisions be made for prompt payment of effective and adequate compensation such compensation is further defined as the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became public knowledge whichever is earlier newer swiss bits also contain an umbrella clause providing that each contracting party shall observe any obligation or commitment it has assumed with regard to investments in its territory by investors of the other contracting party dispute resolution what are the most commonly used dispute resolution options for investment disputes between foreign investors and your state swiss bits contain a wide variety of dispute resolution options which is not surprising since they have been negotiated and signed over a span of more than 50 years see question 5 swiss bits provide that disputes may be submitted to international arbitration if a mandatory consultation phase does not result in an amicable settlement of the dispute however most swiss bits signed before 1981 and two signed thereafter merely contain a state state or horizontal dispute resolution clause nearly all swiss bits signed since 1981 also include investor state or diagonal dispute resolution clauses these are also quite varied but typically provide at the investor s choice either for icsid arbitration or for ad hoc arbitration usually under the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral arbitration rules some bits contain the additional option to submit the dispute to arbitration under the rules of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce confidentiality does the state have an established practice of requiring confidentiality in investment arbitration there is no established practice regarding confidentiality issues that may arise during the course of investment arbitration proceedings since switzerland has not been a party to any known investment treaty arbitrations but in the course of the negotiations regarding the uncitral rules on transparency in treaty based investor state arbitration switzerland took an active role in promoting transparency in investment arbitration moreover seco has announced that switzerland will strive to include in all its future bits a reference to the application of the uncitral rules on transparency and switzerland s recent bit with georgia contains such a reference on 27 march 2015 switzerland signed the un convention on transparency in treaty based investor state arbitration mauritius convention and on 18 april 2017 switzerland became one of the first three states to ratify the un convention on transparency hence resulting in the treaty s entry into force on 18 october 2017 the mauritius convention extended switzerland s consent to apply the uncitral rules on transparency to all swiss bits concluded prior to 1 april 2014 insurance does the state have an investment insurance agency or programme since the discontinuation in 2007 of the former investment risk guarantee fund switzerland no longer has a specific investment insurance programme however switzerland is a member of the multilateral investment guarantee agency furthermore certain investments or aspects of investments may be able to obtain swiss export risk insurance serv coverage serv was not designed to insure direct foreign investments as such however because serv insures exporters of goods or services from switzerland against political risks transfer and moratorium risks force majeure and credit risks investments involving such exports may be able to obtain coverage through it investment arbitration history number of arbitrations how many known investment treaty arbitrations has the state been involved in switzerland has not been a party to any known investment treaty arbitrations industries and sectors do the investment arbitrations involving the state usually concern specific industries or investment sectors no there are no known investment arbitrations involving switzerland selecting arbitrator does the state have a history of using default mechanisms for appointment of arbitral tribunals or does the state have a history of appointing specific arbitrators see question 25 defence does the state typically defend itself against investment claims give details of the state s internal counsel for investment disputes see question 25 enforcement of awards against the state enforcement agreements is the state party to any international agreements regarding enforcement such as the 1958 un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards yes switzerland is a member of the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention which entered into force in switzerland in 1965 in addition as a member of the icsid convention see question 6 switzerland has agreed that icsid awards are final and binding subject only to remedies set out in the convention and that switzerland will comply with such awards switzerland has also obligated itself to enforce icsid awards as if such an award were a final judgment of a court in switzerland switzerland is also a party to several bilateral treaties concerning recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment treaty awards rendered against it see question 25 unfavourable awards if not does the state appeal to its domestic courts or the courts where the arbitration was seated against unfavourable awards see question 25 provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory enforcement of an icsid award in switzerland cannot be hindered by a public policy defence because switzerland s obligation to enforce icsid awards as if such an award were a final judgment of a swiss court see question 28 excludes invocation of public policy as a defence to enforcement with regard to other types of foreign arbitral awards the swiss view of public policy as a defence to enforcement is restrictive a court called on to enforce a foreign arbitral award will only find a public policy violation where the award unbearably shocks the sense of justice as it stands in switzerland and violates fundamental rules of the swiss legal system this is a very high threshold that has rarely been exceeded sovereign immunity may be raised as a defence to enforcement of icsid awards as well as other foreign arbitral awards however the swiss federal supreme court applies a restrictive concept of sovereign immunity there is no guarantee of immunity where a state acts in a private capacity for example as a commercial actor as opposed to acting in its capacity as sovereign public acts the swiss supreme court has recently confirmed that immunity to enforcement of an award will be upheld to the extent it targets assets belonging to foreign states or central banks that are assigned to tasks that are part of their duties as public authorities for example a building used by diplomatic missions however the latter restriction would be of little concern to a foreign investor seeking to enforce an arbitral award against switzerland within swiss territory update and trends current developments are there any emerging trends or hot topics in your jurisdiction switzerland which is not a member of the european union has not followed the european commission or various governments trying to eliminate or significantly reduce the ability of foreign investors to defend themselves against internationally unlawful actions by states instead switzerland quietly continues to move forward with its efforts to update its older bits and to enter into new state of the art bits that address various concerns that have been raised about investor state treaty arbitration by continuing to offer investors and its treaty partners a stable sustainable framework for foreign investments including a reliable and effective mechanism for the resolution of disputes by way of investor state arbitration switzerland is further strengthening its position as an attractive location for companies interested in investing in europe and throughout the world
cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings that are paid for with millions of dollars in public money but owned by private groups inflated rents high interest rates and unexplained costs borne by taxpayers and tax dollars used to pay rents that far exceed the debt on some school buildings this is the world of charter school real estate in new jersey where public money can disappear in a maze of intertwined companies where businesses and investors can turn a profit at taxpayer expense and where decisions about millions in tax dollars are made privately with little public input and little to no oversight by multiple state agencies what

dollars in taxpayer money to private companies that control real estate two of the state s largest charter school operators kipp new jersey and uncommon schools have been permitted by the state to monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator

adding nearly 2 million to the debt that taxpayers are covering in rent there is little public scrutiny and lax oversight from multiple state agencies state education officials don t review building financing or lease agreements before they are signed they don t monitor the associated groups that own real estate for charter schools and new jersey has issued more than 800 million in bonds to construct purchase and renovate charter school buildings without any agency considering who will own them or how much the public will pay in rent dwight berg an economist who has worked on charter school facility deals around the country said new jersey s law doesn t make any sense and has pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities to leasing i m sure that s put a lot of money in private landlords said berg who has been a financial adviser on kipp new jersey projects he advocates for changing the statute to make it easier for charter schools to borrow and buy property and control their own destiny some charter operators have created networks of private entities both for profit and nonprofit to finance and own the real estate that their schools rent

state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law said private ownership of charter school buildings creates a money making situation that lawmakers didn t foresee we envisioned

talks about the original vision for charter schools in the state kevin r wexler northjersey charter operators point out that most of those private groups are nonprofits and maintain they are keeping facility costs down but many details about them are not available to the public because support companies are private it s often impossible to see routine information such as interest rates on loans debt on school facilities or what happens to the money once it leaves the public charter school that lack of transparency is compounded by charter operators who have declined to discuss the details of complicated financial deals that leave property in private hands indefinitely bruce baker a rutgers university professor and a nationally recognized expert on education financing we left these

one building and just shy of a year later in the other for a 150 percent price hike fees of almost 6 4 million accounted for much of the increase rent from charter schools funded by taxpayers will

you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail quote icon the group is also in line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership raises a multitude of issues there s the ethical problem of buying private property with public dollars but there s also the way in which it ties the hands of the policy makers said gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury building owner and developers who have renovated properties and strike long term multimillion dollar leases with schools uncommon schools newest north star academy facility located at 571 585 18th ave in newark included the renovation of a building and the construction of a large addition it opened in november 2018 kevin r wexler northjersey com to be sure not all agreements are unfair to the public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with

time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company

collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no

to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do

building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed

respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private

taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16 million on a 1 million investment documents show the money is being distributed as dividends experts say this is an unusual arrangement i ve done this 25 years and i ve never heard the word dividends

not speak with reporters and did not answer questions that her staff requested be submitted in writing sherrill and adan also served on the board of ashland schools inc which owns two buildings used by team but was not part of the 18th avenue transaction officials at kipp new jersey which is paid to run team and is one of the state s largest operators of charter schools also declined to discuss the financing on the 18th avenue school but they said in a statement that the charter school is paying a reasonable sum to rent a state of the art facility team now pays nearly 2 million annually in rent on the building and is responsible for its upkeep the public charter school also picks up about 330 000 in annual property taxes because pinkhulahoop1 which owns the property was created as a for profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for some other purpose documents indicate that the rent continues to rise dan adan who has served on kingston s and team s boards in an email i can attest that our real estate and associated financing

charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around and give it to another private group with ties to the school called the friends of team here s how the arrangement came together
cashing in on charter schools part one nj taxpayers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to construct and renovate charter school buildings but the public doesn t own them school buildings that are paid for with millions of dollars in public money but owned by private groups inflated rents high interest rates and unexplained costs borne by taxpayers and tax dollars used to pay rents that far exceed the debt on some school buildings this is the world of charter school real estate in new jersey where public money can disappear in a maze of intertwined companies where businesses and

monopolize hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid for public school construction helping them to create networks of privately owned buildings and investors positioned themselves to make millions from taxpayers including real estate entrepreneurs developers and a range of lenders the current situation was born in some ways out of necessity no system was put in place to help charter operators find and finance school buildings to house and educate tens of thousands of students in fact an author of the state s charter school law which gov christine todd whitman signed in 1996 says facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law and what some education experts say is bad policy or no policy at all has created a confusing and tangled landscape where transactions are often secret or buried so deeply in documents that the public has virtually no way of scrutinizing how their tax dollars are being spent private groups that are created to support charter schools and own and finance their real estate sometimes share board members or officers and lend money to one another these groups end up owning and controlling facilities leased by the schools setting rents as they see fit joseph v doria jr a former state legislator

line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership

political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury

public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with

time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company

collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private owner the high school now operates out of another building that was built using 40 million in state issued bonds for the last two years team sublet the norfolk street building to another charter school north star academy for 1 million annually about three times what team had been paying in rent but team didn t get to keep any of that money all of it was passed on to the property s private owner nca facility another charter school briefly rented the building last year but it s been vacant since november for now team academy continues to pay 350 000 in annual rent on an empty building

exclusive redeveloper of the norfolk street property adding that this item is time sensitive the measure passed unanimously two weeks later a team administrator explained plans to finance the 22 million norfolk street project in a letter to the state redevelopment authority dated that october ryan hill then team academy s ceo now leads kipp new jersey which was formed in 2013 to manage team and other nontraditional schools in new jersey he told the authority in the letter that the city had targeted the site for residential redevelopment but a weak economy prompted a change of plans the owner of the land was a real estate entrepreneur david berkowitz who agreed to sell it to a company related to team berkowitz and a partner ian mount created a new company to manage the charter school project ryan hill who now leads kipp new jersey in a letter proposing the deal he made as team academy s ceo to create the 63 20 nonprofit corporation nca facility we understand this structure might be unfamiliar quote icon the deal centers around a relatively obscure irs rule that allows some nonprofits to issue bonds on behalf of government agencies the irs requires such corporations to be controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends board he declined to comment when reached by phone and did not respond to messages after the bond debt is erased documents show the friends group may add new debt to the building to repay new loans

respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private for profit company called pinkhulahoop1 llc was created to own this team academy building at 229 18th ave in newark it cost 36 million to renovate kevin r wexler northjersey com a complex deal leaves taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16 million on a 1 million investment documents show the money is being distributed as dividends experts say this is an unusual arrangement i ve done this 25 years and i ve never heard the word dividends

the financing on the 18th avenue school but they said in a statement that the charter school is paying a reasonable sum to rent a state of the art facility team now pays nearly 2 million annually in rent on the building and is responsible for its upkeep the public charter school also picks up about 330 000 in annual property taxes because pinkhulahoop1 which owns the property was created as a for profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for

charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around and give it to another private group with ties to the school called the friends of team here s how the arrangement came together

facilities weren t addressed to avoid controversy with the state teachers union and others over the creation of the independent public schools a lack of clarity and vagaries in the charter school law

regulatory parameters at the time to make those decisions when the time comes but that s not always the case quick sale a newark charter school changes hands team academy s leaders orchestrated a complicated arrangement more than eight years ago to make sure a 22 million high school building ends up in private hands however a federal tax rule requires the building to be owned by the public once the bonds issued to finance it have been repaid the deal was sanctioned by the new jersey redevelopment authority and by the administration of newark s mayor cory booker presidential candidate and new jersey s junior u s senator the building on norfolk street is owned by a private nonprofit company with ties to the charter school that was created to issue bonds for the project under a rarely used irs rule the bonds were purchased by the friends of team another group with ties to the charter documents obtained by northjersey com show property transfers that were scripted years in advance to meet an irs rule eight years from now the building is scheduled to be flipped twice handed off first to the redevelopment authority and then immediately transferred to the friends group by then 30 million in public money would have been invested in a building that is privately owned millions of dollars pass through the friends group and at least a half dozen partner companies annually recent financial documents show that the friends group holds nearly 6 7 million in cash receives millions of dollars in development fees and controls tens of millions more in federal aid and grants joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law we envisioned that charter schools were going to be community based to reflect the needs of the community and the parents they ve become much more institutional much more corporate than the original concept of the legislation quote icon team academy hasn t used the building in years for a while it subleased the structure to another charter school for nearly 1 million annually about three times what it had been paying in rent passing any earnings to its landlord the building is now empty but team continues to use taxpayer money to pay its 300 000 annual rent and as much as 50 000 in landlord and other fees a sign on a parking lot fence indicates the building will be used by team in the next school year the issue of ownership becomes more pressing as charter schools grow the largest educate thousands of students and plan to expand that means that the charter school affiliates and support groups will over time control more and more property funded by taxpayers doria the former legislator said lawmakers never anticipated that many of new jersey s charter schools would have more than 500 students each this year the state expected 30 charter schools to have more than 500 students and 13 to have enrollments exceeding 1 000 joseph doria a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey he is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university he is seen here in his jersey city office kevin r wexler

embraced charters his successor mayor ras baraka has called for a halt to their expansion in the city both declined to be interviewed team academy is expected to double in size to nearly 8 000 students within three years its private partner groups own five buildings including a former public school and other property team recently purchased its first building a former essex county school but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale bond documents show it intended to finance the purchase with a loan from the friends group the friends group would repay that money by collecting rent from the public charter school which is funded by taxpayers a timeline of events leading to the construction of a team academy building on norfolk street in newark showing how a

thomas contracted to buy them from the city but the friends instead allowed them to be sold to a for profit developer the developer then sold them to the friends after about two months in the case of one building and just shy of a year later in the other for a 150 percent price hike fees of almost 6 4 million accounted for much of the increase rent from charter schools funded by taxpayers will cover the cost of the sale gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail quote icon the group is also in line to buy another former public school building that documents show may be converted to low or moderate income housing experts say the movement of school buildings from public to private ownership raises a multitude of issues there s the ethical problem of buying private property with public dollars but there s also the way in which it ties the hands of the policy makers said gordon lafer a political economist at the university of oregon and a former adviser to the u s house committee on education and labor those issues are compounded he said when a charter school s enrollment grows into the thousands if the price of pulling a charter is you lose a school facility that taxpayer dollars paid for and have to come up with that much more money to build a new school it raises a question of too big to fail he said nj taxpayers foot the bill but have little to show for it fewer than 20 of the state s 88 charter schools directly own at least one of their buildings princeton charter school has owned its facilities since its start in 1997 and now boasts a multi building campus made possible because parents guaranteed part of the school s first mortgage hope academy in asbury park bought its building in 2016 with the help of a tax exempt bond issue and a direct loan from the state economic development authority as a result its mortgage payments are 40 percent less than the rent it would have been paying to a nonprofit group that previously owned the building some charter operators said they were under the impression that new jersey charter schools could not own buildings others said the state discouraged them from owning property state education officials say ownership was never prohibited or discouraged i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school said paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school that way if a charter school that owns its own building closes the property like any other asset would be sold and any excess funds returned to the local school district that wouldn t be the case if the building is owned by a private entity that holds real estate for a charter school the state education department says it has no oversight over such private groups and doesn t regulate privately owned buildings if the charter school closes most charter schools rent whether from unrelated commercial landlords nonprofit groups or other private entities created to support them or own real estate many look to churches the catholic church often through its local dioceses is the largest landlord to charter schools in the state and the public often pays to refurbish aging and vacant church buildings there are charter schools paying rent to a college a medical group a luxury building owner and developers who have renovated properties and strike long term multimillion dollar leases with schools uncommon schools newest north star academy facility located at 571 585 18th ave in newark included the renovation of a building and the construction of a large addition it opened in november 2018 kevin r wexler northjersey com to be sure not all agreements are unfair to the public charter schools but in its review northjersey com saw questionable fees interest rates and other provisions in contracts some contracts were vague a few didn t specify the amount of rent to be paid some included provisions preventing private charter school management companies from being fired without the landlord s consent and one gives a landlord the opportunity to collect more from the school if its revenues rise one lease puts the cost of monitoring for environmental carcinogens on the charter school that rents the property another included a 350 000 charge up front for a nonrefundable purchase option on a catholic church owned building a subsidiary of uncommon schools donated millions to its north star academy charter school in 2017 but a lease signed by the charter required it to give that cash to another subsidiary that was in the process of renovating a building it owns and now leases to north star some charter schools sublease facilities from charter school managers who may tack on other costs in the process college achieve public charter schools inc rents buildings and then turns around and leases them to the three charter schools that it manages with locations in paterson asbury park plainfield and north plainfield college achieve s westervelt avenue school with addition built onto a former catholic school building in north plainfield abbott koloff northjersey com rents in some subleases provided were 10 to 30 percent above what college achieve was scheduled to pay the nonprofit also offers maintenance at a 20 percent markup at the same time college achieve receives more than 14 percent of each school s revenues as a management fee an estimated 3 5 million this school year and documents show that college achieve and not the public charter school holds the purchase option for at least two buildings it adds up a 10 percent increase written into the sublease for one facility for example will mean nearly 40 000 more per year in public money going to the rent another sublease includes a markup in rent of more than 250 000 over four years both leases included start up fees of 100 000 or more that the management company declined to discuss key details are lacking in publicly available documents on another college achieve property in north plainfield neither the lease nor the sublease provided includes the rent the

collateral payment that records show begin next school year rent for the charter school subleasing its paterson location is scheduled to be boosted by almost 80 percent next school year to more than 1 million documents show the new building owner has taken out loans to repay debt and cover the costs of continued renovations but there is no way for the public to know what college achieve pays in rent to justify the price hike because it won t provide an amended lease that property records show was struck this year many pacts that charter schools have struck with associated groups or commercial landlords call for the school to pick up property taxes one school has paid as much as 330 000 annually traditional public schools by contrast don t pay property taxes on the buildings they own contracts often call for charter schools to cover the cost of building repairs and any upgrades needed to get a facility in working order a trenton charter pumped 400 000 into a church owned building that its board president termed a nightmare the charter school left that facility and its investment for a pricey new building within three years before being closed by the state last year team academy has purchased this newark building from essex county county instead of renting it from one of its support groups it is located at 300 13th st in newark kevin r wexler northjersey com elsewhere charter school affiliates have created elaborate financing strategies that combine state issued bonds federal aid and a mix of tax credit programs that draw in banks and other investors these convoluted transactions scream at me said griffin the charter school advocate from colorado when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing one of the most complex of these transactions orchestrated by kipp new jersey involves the purchase and renovation of a former newark public school building kipp s team academy charter school is scheduled to pay 80 percent more in rent money provided by taxpayers than is needed to cover the dept on the property the building s owner identified in tax records and other documents as pinkhulahoop1 llc would pay out close to 16 million in dividends over 30 years to private companies created to support the charter school kipp officials said that the rent is reasonable and that millions of dollars are donated back to the school tax records show the friends of team has taken in more than 27 million in grants and donations since 2010 the school has received just over a third of that money gaps in nj charter school law led to creative financing a central issue is a state law and regulations that even some charter operators describe as both confusing and burdensome and open to interpretation the state provides no start up or facilities funding for charters and puts limits on the debt the schools can carry rules that some say effectively prevents schools from owning their own buildings any debt carried for more than 12 months must be fully secured by property or other assets and are non recourse to the charter school that means that if the school should default a lender can seize only the property charter schools can t use state and local dollars to build a new school a provision clarified in 2017 to mean a completely new building additions and renovations are allowed they can t issue bonds and raise taxes like traditional public schools can and unlike some other states new jersey offers no clear mechanism for a charter to access unused space in the traditional public schools one study shows that 18 states and the district of columbia require surplus space to be offered to charter schools first before it is leased or sold to other buyers all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction kipp new jersey said in a statement lady liberty charter school in newark has closed an auction was held at the school to sell off the contents of its building in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student but charter schools on average receive only about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the new jersey charter schools association it can be much lower for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive new jersey initially approves charter schools for four years and they subsequently come up for renewal every five a turnoff for many lenders and landlords some charter school support organizations say bankers often require that the loans go to private groups that own the school buildings and carry the debt so private groups own the property set the rent and pay off debt with public money from the charter school construction by or on behalf of charters isn t coordinated with local school districts unlike new jersey a number of states offer charter schools help with facilities including direct funding loan guarantees and reimbursement for lease payments kipp new jersey in a statement all facility projects must come out of the charter school s operating budget diverting necessary funds from classroom instruction quote icon still the lack of readily available funding for facilities is a nationwide problem one that can prevent charters from opening or expanding private ownership of charter school buildings is not uncommon in other parts of the country some experts believe it has as much to do with fears about traditional public schools laying claim to the buildings as it does with local laws and financing issues i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut he said the lack of guidelines for those companies opened the way to potential abuses drawing a comparison to the lax regulation of financial markets that led to the subprime mortgage crisis a decade ago there has to be more regulation to guard against the types of abuses that we re now seeing he said new jersey agencies provide little oversight no state agency appears to be looking closely at any of these transactions the state education department says it has a staff of five in the office responsible for overseeing charter schools which has had six directors in the last 10 years the same office oversees a network of renaissance schools in camden that operate under separate rules than charters they receive more funding are allowed to use state funds to construct new buildings and are approved by the city s school district regulations don t limit how much is spent on charter school facilities state education officials said the education department said in a statement that it does not have authority over contracts between the boards and private entities it doesn t have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed or to receive management agreements for all charter schools that contract with a management company it doesn t approve or review charter school projects or long range facilities plans and the department said it doesn t oversee private related companies the department noted that it is responsible for ensuring the school is fiscally sound and providing a quality educational option for students it receives schools audits and budgets and state regulations call for the education commissioner to ensure that charter schools spend about the same percentage of their funds in the classroom as traditional public schools lady liberty charter school in newark was closed at the of the 2017 18 school year an auction was held at the school to sell off its building s contents anne marie caruso northjersey the department said it looks at rent as a budget line item when assessing the financial health of the school but it does not examine those rents as they relate to the debts on the buildings and when schools sublease buildings the state doesn t look at what a school s landlord pays for the property james goenner a charter school advocate said he was blessed to have 30 staff members when he headed an office in michigan overseeing 60 charter schools about a third fewer than new jersey with 30 000 students he said the capacity of state agencies and other offices to adequately oversee charters has been a nationwide issue while public private partnerships can help charter schools obtain facilities he said they also need to be monitored the office that goenner led for 12 years until 2010 had an answer ready when private companies refused to open their books we would smile at that and say we can understand your position said goenner who now leads the national charter schools institute you could choose to be cooperative or you could choose not to work with this school we used our influence in a proactive way paul josephson board secretary and a former board president of the princeton charter school i think that there is no reason why we can t own the school and frankly i think it s the right way because ultimately public monies are going into the school and the public monies that go to the school are being used to pay off the loan and so really it should be an asset of the school quote icon the new jersey state agency that helps charters finance construction said it doesn t consider what schools pay in rent or who owns the buildings the economic development authority has issued more than 800 million in bonds for charters and other nontraditional schools it lends cash from the sale of the bonds but a former director of the agency timothy lizura emphasized that the money comes from the purchaser with no state funds involved yet more than half of those bonds were issued with federal subsidies attached lizura said the agency is just a pass through for the loans which is why it doesn t thoroughly examine the details of these transactions including the use of public money to repay the loans as the conduit issuer we wouldn t look at those things lizura said he said the authority doesn t work too much with the state education department other than to confirm that charter schools are in good standing yet the economic development authority issued more than 10 million in largely tax exempt bonds two years ago for the jersey city community charter school while it was on probation money that was used to refinance debt on buildings owned by the school to pay operating expenses and to buy classroom supplies and equipment the school was taken off probation in early 2017 months later the bonds were downgraded to junk status by a wall street ratings agency that described its overall outlook on the bonds as negative it cited in part management s inability to accurately budget and forecast enrollment the eda also issued 10 million in bonds in 2013 to benefit the troubled lady liberty charter school in newark a year after it came off probation lady liberty charter school has closed an auction was held at the school in newark in the summer of 2018 anne marie caruso northjersey the arrangement saw a nonprofit unrelated to the charter school create a company to act as the borrower and construct an addition to a church owned building lady liberty subleased the facility and its rent payments covered the debt on the bonds the lease payments to the church plus an annual management fee that was scheduled to climb to 40 000 three months after the bonds were issued the state expressed concerns about the school s academic performance later that year the school was found to have failed to follow rules related to its spending of federal and state money in a report issued by the education department s office of fiscal accountability and compliance in june 2014 lady liberty was back on probation where it remained until the state shut it down last year in newark working around a tax rule eight years from now a private company that owns a newark charter school building plans to give it to the state but public ownership of the building constructed using millions of dollars in taxpayer money would be brief as part of back to back transfers arranged years in advance documents show that a state agency has agreed to immediately transfer ownership of the building to another private company that was created to support the charter school by that time taxpayers would have pumped tens of millions of dollars into the building and the public charter school would continue to pay rent an amount that would exceed 1 million annually by 2027 it s all part of a series of transactions worked out more than eight years ago to briefly meet a tax requirement that the public take ownership of the building the people who ran team academy charter school which is part of kipp one of the country s largest charter school networks approached the new jersey redevelopment authority with a plan they proposed creating a company called nca facility inc as a special kind of private nonprofit corporation taking advantage of a rarely used irs rule the private nonprofit would have the authority to issue millions of dollars in bonds on behalf of the public to be used to build a high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the irs rule in question however comes with a provision buildings constructed with the funds are required to be owned by the public once the debt on the bonds issued for the project is paid off when the bonds used to finance the project are set to be retired the redevelopment authority will take control of the building to comply with tax rules according to documents obtained through public records requests excerpts from a 2010 letter from then team academy ceo ryan hill to state officials it details how the state will hand off a building to the private friends of team in 2027 to meet a tax rule the friends plan to assume the debt on the building erasing a debt that a related company had owed to the friends illustration by parisa amini usa today network however the documents show that the authority would immediately transfer ownership of the building to the friends of team a private nonprofit group that supports the charter school in real estate transactions the friends group purchased the bonds in 2011 as a loan to nca facility to construct the building the redevelopment authority agreed to take on the debt decades later and repay it by giving the building to the friends the authority would act as a pass through to erase tens of millions of dollars in debt that team academy s support groups essentially owe to themselves by then the federal government would have paid more than 23 million in interest on the project as part of a school construction aid program state and local taxpayers would have contributed millions more in rent bringing the public s total investment to around 30 million the administration of cory booker newark s mayor at the time and now a u s senator encouraged the deal and signed off on the transfer of the property to the private friends group the city also recommended with booker s prodding that millions of dollars in federally subsidized bonds meant for traditional public schools in newark be given to charter schools instead kipp new jersey s team academy occupies 85 custer ave in newark where a gym was added to the building kevin r wexler northjersey com more than 21 million in bonds meant for the district were eventually used in the newark collegiate academy project according to documents a total of 53 million in bonds earmarked for newark all went to fund privately owned charter school projects in the city with the federal government picking up the interest as a subsidy booker did not respond to a request to discuss the nca deal but he issued a statement saying his intent was to improve education for newark s children he said that the federal financing made available would have been lost to newark if the bonds weren t issued and that the decision was made by multiple government agencies to ensure it went towards strengthening our public school system a state treasury department report indicates that the city would have been required under some circumstances to give unissued bonds to the state to be redistributed booker did not address the question of the school building s ownership a former member of his administration said no one at the time considered who would own the property team academy has since moved newark collegiate academy out of the publicly funded building which has continued to generate income for its private

controlled by a government agency and for the bonds they issue to be for a public purpose the nonprofits are known as 63 20 corporations for the irs rule that applies to them hill asked the authority to create such a company nca facility to issue bonds on the authority s behalf to help finance the norfolk street project once the bonds have been paid off irs rules say the property must be transferred to the government agency that approved them we understand this structure might be unfamiliar hill wrote bond documents show that nca facility later issued more than 21 million in federally subsidized bonds on behalf of the redevelopment authority the state economic development authority issued an additional 6 7 million in the same type of bonds to be used in the transaction hill outlined in the letter how the debt on the building would disappear after two quick transfers nca facility would use money from the bond sale to construct the norfolk street building and to own it but the redevelopment authority had to take nominal ownership of it at some point because of tax requirements hill wrote jim griffin a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools these convoluted transactions scream at me when we don t have clear charter financing mechanisms we wind up with goofy bastardized financing quote icon by then documents show nca facility would owe more than 28 million to the friends group which borrowed from banks to purchase the bonds but tax rules allow the authority to take ownership before the debt is paid and that s what it agreed to do taking on nca facility s debt to the friends as part of the first building transfer in the last step hill told the authority the friends group assumes the debt and takes ownership of the property the building transfer would be considered payment of the outstanding debt that nca facility owed to the friends kipp new jersey declined to discuss the nca deal but issued a statement acknowledging that the redevelopment authority would take ownership and then satisfy the bond debt by transferring the building to the friends in lieu of cash repayment the transactions the statement said followed applicable federal tax law and involved unrelated parties the companies involved are considered separate but they have ties to one another tim carden nca facility s president also sits on the friends

of the building quote icon a school building to pass briefly through public hands the quick transfer of the building was mentioned in multiple documents leslie anderson the executive director of the state redevelopment authority told the board s agency in a memo that the authority would take control of the building and immediately transfer ownership of the school facility to friends of team

respond to requests to be interviewed a former member of the booker administration who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the primary concern driving the construction of the norfolk street building was the need to provide educational opportunities for newark s children the issue of ownership he said wasn t considered we were focused on the school being built he said i don t recall any discussion about changing the ownership of the building nj tax dollars are paying rents that exceed building debts the transaction seemed simple enough on its face the newark public school district sold a run down elementary school to a private for profit group for use by a local charter school but the purchase and rehabilitation of the century old building on 18th avenue was financed with money raised through a complex series of transactions fueled by federal and local tax dollars the cost topped 36 million before it opened to charter school students in 2014 the company that runs the charter school said the deal saved money and keeps rent as low as possible however the rent that team academy charter school will pay over the next three decades all of which comes from state and local taxpayers will be 80 percent more than is needed to pay the debt held by the for profit company that owns the building over that time tens of millions of dollars will fall to investors and other interrelated nonprofit groups as the rent gradually climbs to 3 8 million annually it s perhaps one of the starkest examples of how tax dollars that charter schools spend on facilities can exceed the costs borne by private groups that support them by owning real estate and entering into financial transactions on their behalf some experts say the money a school pays over and above what is needed to cover the debt on its building is returned to it in many cases what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school said david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit that lends money for charter school projects it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school but in most cases there is no guarantee that any excess funds paid will be returned or that rent payments will end when the debt is paid some charter schools pay only enough to repay the debt on their buildings others pay hundreds of thousands more every year in rent for the 18th avenue school that figure is more than 400 000 a year and is scheduled to reach more than 1 million annually by 2032 it s just one instance where charter schools are paying more in rent than is needed to cover their building debt david scheck a financial consultant and a former president of new jersey community capital a nonprofit group that lends money for charter school projects what i have seen in the past is that excess often gets round tripped back to the school it s rent that s paid over and above the amount of debt service that s needed and then at the end of the year that excess gets contributed back into the school quote icon northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey found the following north star academy will pay rent that s 15 percent more than is needed to cover the debt on its newest building in newark according to documents but an analysis of debt and rent schedules shows lease payments would exceed by 50 percent what is needed to cover the debt on the 24 6 million in bonds that the state issued to finance its construction an affiliate of the company that manages the school lent 2 8 million to a related company that owns the building that amount appears to be too small to make up the difference unless the interest rate is extraordinarily high or there s another loan that is not mentioned in the bond documents the school s operator declined to explain in camden a nonprofit charges a charter school 3 3 million to rent five buildings an estimated 1 5 million more than is needed to cover the annual debt a calculation based on a review of bond documents and partial information provided by the landlord on another loan camden s charter school network which owns the buildings calls the rent commercially reasonable and below fair market value and said any payment in excess of the amount needed to pay the debt is returned to the schools in one way or another but the group s tax records do not show any grants to the charter school the school s records do not show that it has received any money back the network s director said the company continues to acquire neighboring properties for the charter school s use and spent 335 000 on building upgrades this summer alone records show it paid more than 500 000 for property last year the school also pays the landlord 1 1 million a year for maintenance in newark the rent that team academy pays each year to use buildings on ashland street and custer avenue exceeds by 20 percent the annual debt on 21 million borrowed to purchase and upgrade those facilities the rent is 1 5 million a year the annual debt payments total about 1 25 million documents show the property owner a nonprofit named ashland schools inc keeps the excess and at its sole discretion may donate that money to team to friends of team a group that supports the school in real estate transactions or to other entities provided that any required repairs have been funded records show team has received a 263 000 refund which is equivalent to a year of excess rent but it paid more than 1 million in additional rent in 2017 and 2018 in paterson a charter school pays 2 63 million in rent annually to a subsidiary of a nonprofit for two buildings that s 30 percent more than the annual debt payment on more than 30 million in bonds that the state issued to finance the purchase and renovation of one of of the structures the paterson charter school for science and technology had been paying 400 000 more than the annual debt payments a lease amendment signed in 2017 boosted its rent to nearly 600 000 more than is needed to cover the debt leases say the difference between the rent and the debt service and other costs is considered a landlord s fee and a school official said it was that portion that was increased the landlord a subsidiary of apple educational services said it maintains the buildings at considerable expense and that it spent 360 000 last year just on new air conditioning but the school now must also reimburse the landlord for any costs associated with monitoring for environmental issues at one of the buildings in many of the documents reviewed there is no indication that ownership of the buildings will ever shift from the private entities to the public charter schools and when there is there can be loopholes that keep them in private hands in the case of the paterson school the recent changes to its leases boosting the rent also added a provision permitting the charter to purchase each building for 1 when the bond debt is paid off in 2044 but the lease allows the charter to designate a third party that supports the school to receive title to the property by then the charter school would have paid at least 15 million more than the debt in camden two buildings that were owned by charter schools are now privately held having been transferred to a private group for 1 each that group camden s charter school network said lenders required it to own the two properties in order to get financing for new projects the charter schools that had owned the buildings merged into a single school that school now rents those buildings and three others while continuing to repay federal bonds related to one of them a private for profit company called pinkhulahoop1 llc was created to own this team academy building at 229 18th ave in newark it cost 36 million to renovate kevin r wexler northjersey com a complex deal leaves taxpayers on the hook of the transactions reviewed one of the most expensive for taxpayers and by far the most complex involves the 18th avenue school in newark that team academy rents the building was purchased from the newark school district in 2013 for 4 3 million the sale and improvements were financed through a series of transactions involving multiple entities including five private companies that support the charter school the property is owned by pinkhulahoop1 llc which supports team and was created as a for profit company to take advantage of a federal tax credit documents show that pinkhulahoop1 is scheduled to pay at least 47 5 million over 30 years to cover the building s debt the public charter school however will pay 84 3 million in renpt over that period according to an analysis of rent schedules in lease documents taxpayers will also kick in an estimated 40 million in federal aid for the building project an additional 8 million in federal tax credits will go to one of the lenders in all about 130 million in public money is scheduled to be pumped into the project all that cash supports a complicated financial deal that includes multiple loans and tax credits and millions of additional dollars in fees and other expenses that are driving up costs for the school much of that will be distributed to team s support groups and other investors in fees and interest payments most of the loans in the transaction have low interest rates but other payments built into it increase the costs which are funded by the public charter school s school s rent friends of team for example will receive more than 5 million in development fees and another 5 million in management fees and other distributions documents show and two affiliates are getting back close to 16 million on a 1 million investment documents show the money is being distributed as dividends experts say this is an unusual arrangement i ve done this 25 years and i ve never heard the word dividends mentioned once jim griffin a charter school expert and a former executive director of the colorado league of charter schools said after the arrangement was described to him kindergarten classroom at the 229 18th avenue team academy school in newark a building that was renovated for 36 million and is owned by a for profit charter support group called pinkhulahoop1 llc marko georgiev northjersey com where does the money go most of those dividends go to kingston educational holdings 1 an entity created to help acquire property for team s use kingston will take in an additional 12 million in interest from two loans it made as part of the transaction it is not known how that money will be used two of kingston s board members at the time dan adan who has also served on team s board and tim carden who serves on the board of friends of team declined to speak with reporters i can attest that our real estate and associated financing transactions were structured and completed with one goal in mind to provide the best possible facilities for our students at the most efficient cost adan said in an email there is no doubt that these facilities and associated improvements have benefited both the students and the newark community preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut i think there was a failure to anticipate private entities taking advantage quote icon mikie sherrill who served on kingston s board for about four years before she was elected in november to represent the state s 11th district in congress as a democrat also would not speak with reporters and did not answer questions that her staff requested be submitted in writing sherrill and adan also served on the board of ashland schools inc which owns two buildings used by team but was not part of the 18th avenue transaction officials at kipp new jersey which is paid to run team and is one of the state s largest operators of charter schools also declined to discuss the financing on the 18th avenue school but they said in a statement that the charter school is paying a reasonable sum to rent a state of the art facility team now pays nearly 2 million annually in rent on the building and is responsible for its upkeep the public charter school also picks up about 330 000 in annual property taxes because pinkhulahoop1 which owns the property was created as a for profit company to get the benefit of federal tax credits kipp officials said federal tax credits helped to lower the cost of the building and more than made up for the property taxes paid by the school but pinkhulahoop1 s for profit status means it s scheduled to pay more than 13 million in federal taxes through 2045 tax credits used in the project were passed to a bank in exchange for low interest loans financial experts said that once the credits are used by the bank loans related to the project could be refinanced freeing up millions of dollars that could lower rents or be used for some other purpose documents indicate that the rent continues to rise dan adan who has served on kingston s and team s boards in an email i can attest that our real estate and associated financing transactions were structured and completed with one goal in mind to provide the best possible facilities for our students at the most efficient cost there is no doubt that these facilities and associated improvements have benefited both the students and the newark community quote icon kipp officials said that any excess rent paid by team is used to pay creditors establish required reserves or is returned to the schools in subsidies their landlords they said do not keep excess cash from rents to the contrary more than 10 million has gone back into our educational programming since 2009 the statement said kipp officials did not elaborate and no documents link the excess rent to payments made to the school financial records show the friends of team gave the school more than 10 million during that period during the same time the friends received more than 27 million in grants almost three times what it gave to the school email rimbach northjersey com and koloff northjersey com the story has been updated to reflect that north star academy s building in newark is open timeline kipp team academy charter school newark collegiate academy almost a decade ago officials at team academy charter school approached a new jersey state agency with a proposal team would create a company called nca facility inc as a private nonprofit corporation to issue millions of dollars in bonds funding that was part of a federal school construction program and originally earmarked for newark s traditional public schools to build a charter high school for team on norfolk street called newark collegiate academy the nonprofit would construct the building and own it until the bonds mature in 2027 then to meet tax rules it would give the building to the state agency which would turn around and give it to another private group with ties to the school called the friends of team here s how the arrangement came together
with the german 10 year bunds closing last week with a yield of negative 0 03 talk of yield curve inversion and a global recession is rampant as some short term interest rates in the u s are now drifting above the 10 year treasury yield still the classic 2 10 spread or the difference in yield between the 2 year and the 10 year treasury notes has not inverted yet and â until it does â the jury is still out on the possibility of the present u s economic expansion ending graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary the issue may very well be that international demand for treasuries in a year of record supply is rather strong there simply isn t any significantly positive yield in any key global government bond market so bond buyers end up piling into the u s treasury market german 2 year federal notes which go by the tongue twisting name bundesschatzanweisungen have been in negative territory for five years and closed last week at 0 55 that means that the german 2 10 spread is a positive 52 basis points as subtracting one negative number from another results in a positive interest rate differential japan faces a similar situation where the 10 year jgbs closed the week at 0 07 while the 2 year notes closed at 0 17 graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary negative yielding 10 year government bonds in major world economies are a clear sign of global deflation where overly indebted developed economies are struggling to grow while the overly indebted chinese economy has trouble picking up the slack the headline inflation rate in both the u s and germany is 1 5 while the german economic data such as industrial production is noticeably weaker it is no wonder that the fed has removed itself from the picture by clearly saying that they will be on the sidelines for a while when it comes to the fed funds rate when it comes to the ongoing quantitative tightening via the run off of bonds from the fedâ s balance sheet it looks like it will stop by the end of this year as per chairman jerome powellâ s statements it is amazing how 1 3 trillion in treasury supply courtesy of the trump tax cuts combined with 500 billion run off cap from the fedâ s balance sheet cannot get the 10 year treasury yield to even 3 long term interest rates feel very heavy and if they cross 2 to the downside and the 2 10 spread finally inverts they may not see 3 for many years graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary there appears to be a â head and shouldersâ top in the 10 year treasury yield to use trading terminology which â brokeâ at 2 6 the â headâ is 3 25 so the gap measures 0 65 or 65 bps if the fascinating world of chartology is any indication this chart says the 10 year note yield is headed to 1 95 which is a heck of a lot weaker than most investors including myself expected at the beginning of the year personally i do not make decisions based on charts alone but i have never met a futures trader that does not know how to read a chart and there is a lot of futures trading going on in the treasury market and the euro dollar and fed funds market for that matter they all say that the fed is done in my view this decline in 10 year note yields is much more due to a weak global economy than any issue with the united states the next time there is recession i think the 10 year treasury yield will likely break 1 given the willingness of the u s central bank to engage in such unorthodox monetary policies based on the low level of unemployment in the u s and largely pro growth white house economic policies there is not going to be a recession in the u s this year but when it comes to 2020 and 2021 a lot can change fed â on holdâ beneficiaries in theory this sharp decline in global bond yields catalyzed by the fed being â on holdâ and weak data in europe and china should be bullish for gold bullion and emerging markets as is often the case when fed tightening cycles end in theory an end of fed tightening should be bearish for the dollar but not this time i think the dollar has more upside because the euro and the chinese yuan have more downside the ecb is proceeding with more qe which is euro bearish and coupled with the epic brexit disaster is bound to push the euro lower by the end of the euro weakening cycle it is conceivable that the euro falls below parity 1 1 to the dollar the interest rate differentials are dramatically in favor of the u s dollar and while the fed is in qt mode the ecb is in qe mode parity is only a matter of time in such a scenario the chinese yuan on the other hand is not part of the u s dollar index still china is in a very sharp slowdown which is catalyzed but not caused by tariffs and trade friction because of the deflationary nature of too much debt in the chinese financial system it is entirely plausible that the peopleâ s bank of china pboc decides to devalue the yuan as it did in december 1993 when they did so to the tune of 34 at the time there was a sharp recession in china that was not officially acknowledged but it showed up in secondary i e undoctored banking loan loss data in the year 2019 there is much more at stake as the chinese economy is nearly 20 times larger than it was in 1993 and its level of indebtedness is at least four fold higher causing a sharp economic slowdown to carry the high likelihood of a hard economic landing the jury is still out if the present sharp slowdown ends up like a second asian crisis but there is no doubt in my mind that this is where china is headed the loan quotas and injections of more liquidity in the chinese financial system are tools that have allowed the chinese government to prolong their economic expansion for over 25 years those same tools will be the very reasons that make the hard landing a lot worse since they have resulted in a massive credit bubble so if someone is waiting to see the emerging markets outperform â or for the u s dollar to go down â it could be a very long

b2gold s directors have approved the expansion vancouver march 26 2019 prnewswire b2gold corp tsx bto nyse american btg nsx b2g b2gold or the company is pleased to announce very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine located in mali and that the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa all dollar figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated the expansion study pea was conducted to evaluate the life of mine lom options for expanded mining and processing to maximize the value of the substantially increased indicated and inferred mineral resource at the fekola mine see news release dated october 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production results of this study recommend an expansion of the existing plant to process an additional 1 5 mtpa resulting in a baseline capacity of 7 5 mtpa without requiring an additional ball mill or additional power generation capacity based on the new optimized mine plan the mining rate at fekola will also be increased along with additional mining equipment to accelerate the supply of higher grade ore to the expanded processing facilities as a result of the project and mineral resource expansion the fekola mine will produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous lom mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study preliminary economic assessment will be realized highlights of fekola expansion study pea assuming an effective date of january 1 2019 a gold price of 1 300 per ounce and a discount rate of 5 project economics highlights from the expansion study pea include a gold price of per ounce and a discount rate of 5 project economics highlights from the expansion

one year estimated processing plant expansion capital cost of approximately 50 million over a period of approximately 18 months for processing expansion and upgrades through q3 2020 half of this capital is expected to be spent in 2019 with the remaining half in 2020 it is anticipated that this will be financed from existing fekola mine cash flows over a period of approximately 18 months for processing expansion and upgrades through q3 2020 half of this capital is expected to be spent in 2019 with the remaining half in 2020 it is anticipated that this will be financed from existing fekola mine cash flows projected annual mining rate increased to a baseline of approximately 54 mtpa and subsequently stepped up to approximately 76 mtpa to support the increased processing and stockpiling necessary to maintain plant feed grade staged mining fleet additions totalling approximately 56 million over the lom are expected to be equipment loans lease financed over respective 5 year periods on terms similar to the existing fekola fleet loan lease terms projected annual processing rate increased to a baseline of 7 5 mtpa current capacity of 6 mtpa plus 1 5 mtpa ongoing drilling continues to infill the existing inferred mineral resources to indicated mineral resources mineralization remains open to the north and down plunge indicating the potential to further increase fekola mineral resources and reserves a large exploration drilling program will commence in q3 2019 to further test the fekola north cardinal and anaconda zones during the expansion study other upside opportunities were identified and are currently under review these will be incorporated into an updated fekola lom plan when related studies are complete and if they show an increase in overall project value upside opportunities identified to date include renewable energy focused on a solar plant alternative tailings storage co disposal paste dry stack and others waste mining various fleet options vs in pit crushing and conveying and the potential incorporation of material from the anaconda mineral resource basis of the study on october 25 2018 the company announced a substantial increase in the mineral resource for the fekola mine and positive results from the conceptual stage of the expansion study b2gold reported an indicated mineral resource of 92 8 million tonnes at a grade of 1 92 grams per tonne g t containing 5 73 million ounces and an inferred mineral resource of 26 5 million tonnes at a grade of 1 61 g t containing 1 37 million ounces see news release dated 10 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production this expanded resource coupled with positive results of an internal conceptual study formed the basis of and motivation for the expansion study pea mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability based on positive results of the conceptual fekola expansion study the company continued testing and design with the same lycopodium brisbane team which performed engineering and design work for the current fekola mill and infrastructure and contracted whittle consulting whittle to work together with the company s technical team to conduct an enterprise optimization study of the fekola project results have confirmed the value of the processing expansion and recommend a corresponding increase in mining capacity whittle evaluated mining production rates pit and phase scheduling dynamic cut off grades ore stockpiling blending and dynamic processing throughput and recovery to maximize project npv these parameters will continue to be optimized during the next phases of project design and implementation in the meantime the company is nearing completion on front end engineering and design feed for the expansion with a focus on long lead items the project schedule indicates that the processing expansion will be fully operational by q4 2020 b2gold is currently investigating the potential to accelerate this schedule based on the availability of long lead items as currently envisioned the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which will be commissioned in q3 2020 in parallel with the expansion b2gold is studying the addition of a solar power plant which would reduce operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions the current on site power plant has sufficient capacity to support the expanded processing throughput with or without the solar plant the current mining fleet consists of four caterpillar 6020b excavators with haul trucks drills and support equipment to match and mines an average of 36 mtpa the whittle results currently indicate that mining production rates ranging from 54 mtpa to 76 mtpa are optimal to support the expanded processing rates over the lom and optimize head grade during the period 2020 2024 increased production will be achieved with the addition of two to four excavators with corresponding trucks drills and support equipment large front end loaders would also be included to maintain fleet flexibility mine fleet expansion timing and scale will be optimized during q2 2019 and will generally be equipment loan lease financed over a five year period the study has included 28 million for expansion to 54 mtpa and an additional 28 million for a total of 56 million to go to 76 mtpa in parallel with the whittle study b2gold is reviewing in pit crushing and conveying as a means to reduce operating costs and potentially implement tailings and waste co disposal at the fekola mine b2gold is also considering the option of transporting the nearby anaconda saprolite material to fekola for processing see news release dated 06 15 2017 with the combination of the increased indicated and inferred mineral resource and implementation of the processing expansion and mining expansion the fekola mine will see a substantial increase in annual and lom gold production and revenues revised lom cash operating cash costs and aisc are estimated at below 500 and 700 per ounce respectively despite mining a larger open pit at slightly lower gold grade under the pea low costs are forecast to be maintained through the new extended fekola mine life due to economies of scale arising from increased mining and processing rates and the optimized mining schedule during the five year period 2020 2024 under the new optimized lom aisc are expected to average approximately 630 per ounce current pea expansion estimates indicate approximate annual gold production averaging over 400 000 ounces per year over the new lom including 2019 with over 550 000 ounces per year over the five year period 2020 2024 total processed tonnage currently included in the expansion study pea consists of approximately 84 million tonnes processed over the lom period 2019 2030 at a grade of 1 9 g t producing approximately 5 0 million ounces prior to 2019 the fekola mine produced more than 550 000 ounces from its operations since inception the fekola resources remain open to the north and down plunge head grade may be optimized to an average of up to 2 3 g t over the period 2020 2024 with an increased mining rate and ore stockpiling under the current expansion study pea assumptions mine life extends to 12 years including 2019 into 2030 even with the increased processing rate of 7 5 mtpa mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability upside potential b2gold s technical team along with lycopodium whittle consulting and others continues to study and optimize several components of the fekola mine ongoing studies include optimizing the mine production schedule and stockpile strategy adding solar power reviewing various tailings and waste disposal strategies and the potential to process material from the anaconda project located to the north through the fekola plant these studies will continue through q2 2019 and will be incorporated into a revised fekola lom plan which is expected to be available by the end of q1 2020 since january 2019 up to seven drill rigs have completed 27 drill holes focussed on infill drilling the inferred portion of the new fekola mineral resource 21 to indicated so that an updated geologic and grade model can be completed in late 2019 this will allow the engineering group to complete an updated design pit and new mineral reserves along with an updated fekola lom plan by the end of q1 2020 once infill drilling is completed at the end of q2 2019 b2gold plans to immediately dedicate exploration drill rigs to test several targets with the potential to expand the mineral resources these targets include the fekola north area beyond the current resource boundary that remains open along strike and down plunge the cardinal structures west of the operating mine and the fekola south area where previous wide spaced drilling has shown potential for additional mineralization below the main fekola orebody in addition in early q3 drill rigs will be mobilized to the anaconda region to continue efforts to expand the previously announced shallow saprolite resource as well as further tests for hard rock mineralization targets below the saprolite resource about b2gold corp headquartered in vancouver canada b2gold corp is the world s new senior gold producer founded in 2007

treaties do not relate to the same subject matter those treaties shall continue to operate in parallel otherwise when two successive treaties between two parties cover the same subject matter this

state however regarding foreign investments the law provides that the state or its public institutions are represented before icsid tribunals by the institution or the public authority that managed the issues in the dispute regarding the mutual protection of the investments where those issues were managed by more institutions or public authorities the competence of representation before an icsid tribunal is established by the government to ensure the representation of romania before an icsid tribunal the competent public institution or authority selects lawyers either from romania or abroad specialised in international disputes with the observance of the public procurement legislation in other arbitrations that are not based on bits but on privatisation agreements of state owned companies the institution usually served with process is the authority for the administration of state assets aaas the aaas exercises all rights and obligations deriving from the state s capacity as shareholder in relation to the management restructuring privatisation or liquidation of the state owned companies investment treaty practice model bit does the state have a model bit romania does not have a model bit nonetheless analysis of the bits signed by romania after 1990 illustrates that many of the clauses inserted therein are similar to most bits reflecting the country s interest in ensuring a uniform protection of the foreign investors in romania as well as offering comparable business conditions for national investors in foreign countries preparatory materials does the state

policy some of which date back to the beginning of the 19th century the documents which consist of preparatory files correspondence between governments and diplomatic reports can be consulted on site

of the bits concluded by romania cover a wide range of assets including movable and immovable property and other property rights such as mortgages shares bonds and other kinds of legal interests in companies intellectual property rights receivables business concessions conferred by law or under contract claims to any activity having an economic value the protection is offered to any foreign investor understood as a general rule as any citizen of a contracting party or as any legal entity incorporated under the laws of the state where its headquarters are located from a general perspective the main scope of the bits concluded by romania with other states is to promote and to protect the investments and to offer sufficient guarantees to investors for a safe business climate on the contracting parties jurisdictions protections what substantive protections are typically available bits concluded by romania offer a bundle of protections to foreign investors such as protection against expropriation or equivalent measures the right to a fair and equitable treatment the right to repatriate incomes and other funds a full protection clause and a guaranteed treatment in line with that granted by the host state to its most favoured nation or to its own nationals dispute resolution what are the most commonly used dispute resolution options for investment disputes between foreign investors and your state in addition to submitting a dispute to icsid a number of bits concluded by romania provide for other options such as referring the dispute to the domestic courts of the contracting party s state on whose territory the investment was made or to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal established under united nations commission on international trade law rules of arbitration as in the case of the treaty between the government of romania and the government of the united states of america on mutual encouragement and the safeguarding of investments of 28 may 1992 the agreement between the government of romania and the government of the republic of peru for the promotion and safeguarding of investments signed in lima on 16 may 1994 or the agreement between the government of romania and the government of the republic of kazakhstan on the promotion and the safeguarding of investments of 2 march 2010 however no information is available regarding the use of these dispute resolution options in the case of litigation arisen from bits signed by romania as far as the settlement of disputes by icsid is concerned romania has been involved in several disputes settled under the icsid convention icsid is therefore the most commonly used dispute resolution option for investment disputes confidentiality does the state have an established practice of requiring confidentiality in investment arbitration no information is available regarding confidentiality in investment arbitration in spite of this the awards concerning romania are generally publicly available whereas other documents such as expert opinions memorials and hearings transcripts are not subject to disclosure insurance does the state have an investment insurance agency or programme at present there is no specific investment insurance programme for foreign investments therefore there is no special insurance for investors nevertheless the investor may conclude private insurances in connection with their investments for deploying certain activities romanian law may impose mandatory insurance coverage for example the providers of healthcare services medicine or medical devices when concluding contracts with the public health authority are obliged to hold insurance policies against malpractice investment arbitration history number of arbitrations how many known investment treaty arbitrations has the state been involved in to date romania has been involved in 14 investment treaty arbitrations of which nine were concluded and five are still pending see notable cases involving romania were disputes initiated by a major private oil company a company operating commercial venues in airports and individual investors owning a group of companies in a disfavoured region the most recent arbitration action was initiated in june 2018 by an international electrical automation and mechanical installations company regarding a renewable energy generation enterprise no information is publicly available regarding investment treaty arbitrations organised outside the icsid convention industries and sectors do the investment arbitrations involving the state usually concern specific industries or investment sectors investment arbitration involving romania has concerned various specific industries such as duty free shops newspaper distribution the investment sector or the oil sector numerous disputes were initiated following investments made during the privatisation period after 1990 selecting arbitrator does the state have a history of using default mechanisms for appointment of arbitral tribunals or does the state have a history of appointing specific arbitrators in cases involving romania the arbitral tribunal is composed of three arbitrators one appointed by each party and the chairman appointed by both parties and failing that using the default mechanism under the icsid convention as a rule the selection of arbitrators is based on the general principles of selection which primarily concern independence and impartiality good knowledge of mechanisms and legislative provisions as well as experience gained in similar international disputes both romanian and foreign professionals have been selected defence does the state typically defend itself against investment claims give details of the state s internal counsel for investment disputes broadly speaking the defence against investment claims is administered by means of cooperation between the in house lawyers of the romanian government or government department as the case may be and the specialised law firms either domestic or foreign whose services are contracted to serve this purpose enforcement of awards against the state enforcement agreements is the state party to any international agreements regarding enforcement such as the 1958 un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards romania adheres to the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention by decree no 181 1961 of the state council published in the official gazette no 19 of 1961 romania has made declarations and reserves under article i 3 of the convention award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment treaty awards rendered against it there has only been one unfavourable award rendered against romania the effects of which pursuant to the provisions of the icsid convention have been stayed by a judgment of the bucharest court of appeal until the icsid annulment procedure is over if there are other cases where unfavourable awards were rendered against romania they were most likely voluntarily implemented unfavourable awards if not does the state appeal to its domestic courts or the courts where the arbitration was seated against unfavourable awards the first unfavourable award rendered against romania was delivered in an icsid case see question 29 romania at the time of writing has filed an application for annulment pursuant to the icisid convention provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory first foreign awards should be divided between awards rendered and those not rendered under the icsid convention for the first category the provisions of the icsid convention dealing with the enforcement of awards are incidental while for the latter their enforcement is governed by the new york convention or the romanian civil procedure code second to have the awards enforced leave by the court has to be granted based on an application by the concerned party pursuant to article 1126 of the romanian civil procedure code third the principle enshrined in article 1125 of the civil procedure code is that any foreign arbitral award may be recognised and enforced in romania insofar as the dispute may be subject to arbitration in romania and as long as the award has no provision inconsistent with romanian public policy failure to comply with the two requirements implies a refusal to enforce the award last as far as other impediments to enforcement are concerned the civil procedure code of romania provides under article 1129 the following cases when an enforcement of a foreign arbitral award may be hindered the parties were under an incapacity to conclude the arbitration agreement according to their own law established pursuant to the law of the state where the award was rendered the arbitration agreement was void pursuant to the law elected by the parties or failing such election pursuant to the law of the state where the award was rendered the party against which the award is enforced was not duly informed on the appointment of the arbitrators or on the arbitration proceedings or it was unable to defend in arbitral dispute the appointment of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitration proceedings violated the convention of the parties or failing such convention the law of the place of arbitration the award deals with a dispute not provided by the arbitration convention or outside the limit set out by such convention or comprises provisions exceeding the terms of the arbitral convention however as long as the provisions from the award dealing with the aspects subject to arbitration may be separated from those regarding aspects not subject to arbitration the former are to be recognised and enforced and the award is not yet binding on the parties or it was set aside or stayed by a competent authority from the state where or pursuant to which it was rendered update and trends current developments are there any emerging trends or hot topics in your jurisdiction law no 98 2016 on public procurements authorised the romanian executive to adopt models of general and special terms and conditions to be used for the works and design contracts on investments financed from public resources at the beginning of 2018 according to government resolution no 1 2018 such models were enacted by the romanian executive as far as the settlement of disputes deriving from or in connection with a contract is concerned the models propose a multi tier arbitration clause in case of claims made by a contractor seeking additional time for work or additional costs the first tier consists of a mandatory pre arbitral procedure before a person acting as a supervisor who will render the decision on the claims submitted by the contractor against such a decision of the supervisor any party may present its written dissatisfaction and may commence the arbitration the institution selected for arbitration by the romanian executive is the international court of arbitration attached to the romanian branch of the international chamber of commerce icc the procedural arbitration rules proposed by the romanian executive are those of the romanian icc s branch of the international court of arbitration

the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine located in mali and that the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa all dollar figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated the expansion study pea was conducted to evaluate the life of mine lom options for expanded mining and processing to maximize the value of the substantially increased indicated and inferred mineral resource at the fekola mine see news release dated october 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production results of this study recommend an expansion of the existing plant to process an additional 1 5 mtpa resulting in a baseline capacity of 7 5 mtpa without requiring an additional ball mill or additional power generation capacity based on the new optimized mine plan the mining rate at fekola will also be increased along with additional mining equipment to accelerate the supply of higher grade ore to the expanded processing facilities as a result of the project and mineral resource expansion the fekola mine will produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous lom mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there

one year estimated processing plant expansion capital cost of approximately 50 million over a period of approximately 18 months for processing expansion and upgrades through q3 2020 half of this capital is expected to be spent in 2019 with the remaining half in 2020 it is anticipated that this will be financed from existing fekola mine cash flows over a period of approximately 18 months for processing expansion and upgrades through q3 2020 half of this capital is expected to be spent in 2019 with the remaining half in 2020 it is anticipated that this will be financed from existing fekola mine cash flows projected annual mining rate increased to a baseline of approximately 54 mtpa and subsequently stepped up to approximately 76 mtpa to support the increased processing and stockpiling necessary to maintain plant feed grade staged mining fleet additions totalling approximately 56 million over the lom are expected to be equipment loans lease financed over respective 5 year periods on terms similar to the existing fekola fleet loan lease terms projected annual processing rate increased to a baseline of 7 5 mtpa current capacity of 6 mtpa plus 1 5 mtpa ongoing drilling continues to infill the existing inferred mineral resources to indicated mineral resources mineralization remains open to the north and down plunge indicating the potential to further increase fekola mineral resources and reserves a large exploration drilling program will commence in q3 2019 to further test the fekola north cardinal and anaconda zones during the expansion study other upside opportunities were identified and are currently under review these will be incorporated into an updated fekola lom plan when related studies are complete and if they show an increase in overall project value upside opportunities identified to date include renewable energy focused on a solar plant alternative tailings storage co disposal paste dry stack and others waste mining various fleet options vs in pit crushing and conveying and the potential incorporation of material from the anaconda mineral resource basis of the study on october 25 2018 the company announced a substantial increase in the mineral resource for the fekola mine and positive results from the conceptual stage of the expansion study b2gold reported an indicated mineral resource of 92 8 million tonnes at a grade of 1 92 grams per tonne g t containing 5 73 million ounces and an inferred mineral resource of 26 5 million tonnes at a grade of 1 61 g t containing 1 37 million ounces see news release dated 10 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production this expanded resource coupled with positive results of an internal conceptual study formed the basis of and motivation for the expansion study pea mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability based on positive results of the conceptual fekola expansion study the company continued testing and design with the same lycopodium brisbane team which performed engineering and design work for the current fekola mill and infrastructure and contracted whittle consulting whittle to work together with the company s technical team to conduct an enterprise optimization study of the fekola project results have confirmed the value of the processing expansion and recommend a corresponding increase in mining capacity whittle evaluated mining production rates pit and phase scheduling dynamic cut off grades ore stockpiling blending and dynamic processing throughput and recovery to maximize project npv these parameters will continue to be optimized during the next phases of project design and implementation in the meantime the company is nearing completion on front end engineering and design feed for the expansion with a focus on long lead items the project schedule indicates that the processing expansion will be fully operational by q4 2020 b2gold is currently investigating the potential to accelerate this schedule based on the availability of long lead items as currently envisioned the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which will be commissioned in q3 2020 in parallel with the expansion b2gold is studying the addition of a solar power plant which would reduce operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions the current on site power plant has sufficient capacity to support the expanded processing throughput with or without the solar plant the current mining fleet consists of four caterpillar 6020b excavators with haul trucks drills and support equipment to match and mines an average of 36 mtpa the whittle results currently indicate that mining production rates ranging from 54 mtpa to 76 mtpa are optimal to support the expanded processing rates over the lom and optimize head grade during the period 2020 2024 increased production will be achieved with the addition of two to four excavators with corresponding trucks drills and support equipment large front end loaders would also be included to maintain fleet flexibility mine fleet expansion timing and scale will be optimized during q2 2019 and will generally be equipment loan lease financed over a five year period the study has included 28 million for expansion to 54 mtpa and an additional 28 million for a total of 56 million to go to 76 mtpa in parallel with the whittle study b2gold is reviewing in pit crushing and conveying as a means to reduce operating costs and potentially implement tailings and waste co disposal at the fekola mine b2gold is also considering the option of transporting the nearby anaconda saprolite material to fekola for processing see news release dated 06 15 2017 with the combination of the increased indicated and inferred mineral resource and implementation of the processing expansion and mining expansion the fekola mine will see a substantial increase in annual and lom gold production and revenues revised lom cash operating cash costs and aisc are estimated at below 500 and 700 per ounce respectively despite mining a larger open pit at slightly lower gold grade under the pea low costs are forecast to be maintained through the new extended fekola mine life due to economies of scale arising from increased mining and processing rates and the optimized mining schedule during the five year period 2020 2024 under the new optimized lom aisc are expected to average approximately 630 per ounce current pea expansion estimates indicate approximate annual gold production averaging over 400 000 ounces per year over the new lom including 2019 with over 550 000 ounces per year over the five year period 2020 2024 total processed tonnage currently included in the expansion study pea consists of approximately 84 million tonnes processed over the lom period 2019 2030 at a grade of 1 9 g t producing approximately 5 0 million ounces prior to 2019 the fekola mine produced more than 550 000 ounces from its operations since inception the fekola resources remain open to the north and down plunge head grade may be optimized to an average of up to 2 3 g t over the period 2020 2024 with an increased mining rate and ore stockpiling under the current expansion study pea assumptions mine life extends to 12 years including 2019 into 2030 even with the increased processing rate of 7 5 mtpa mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability upside potential b2gold s technical team along with lycopodium whittle consulting and others continues to study and optimize several components of the fekola mine ongoing studies include optimizing the mine production schedule and stockpile strategy adding solar power reviewing various tailings and waste disposal strategies and the potential to process material from the anaconda project located to the north through the fekola plant these studies will continue through q2 2019 and will be incorporated into a revised fekola lom plan which is expected to be available by the end of q1 2020 since january 2019 up to seven drill rigs have completed 27 drill holes focussed on infill drilling the inferred portion of the new fekola mineral resource 21 to indicated so that an updated geologic and grade model can be completed in late 2019 this will allow the engineering group to complete an updated design pit and new mineral reserves along with an updated fekola lom plan by the end of q1 2020 once infill drilling is completed at the end of q2 2019 b2gold plans to immediately dedicate exploration drill rigs to test several targets with the potential to expand the mineral resources these targets include the fekola north area beyond the current resource boundary that remains open along strike and down plunge the cardinal structures west of the operating mine and the fekola south area where previous wide spaced drilling has shown potential for additional mineralization below the main fekola orebody in addition in early q3 drill rigs will be mobilized to the anaconda region to continue efforts to expand the previously announced shallow saprolite resource as well as further tests for hard rock mineralization targets below the saprolite resource about b2gold corp headquartered in vancouver canada b2gold corp is the world s new senior gold producer founded in 2007

clean walkable neighborhoods with an environment that is conducive for families to thrive healthy neighborhoods can be a critical part of the fabric of a child s education experience affordable housing i believe the emphasis needs to be placed on developing incentive programs and public private partnerships with residential builders and not for profit organizations to address the housing needs of the majority of residents that fall between 60 and 80 percent of area median income ami this population has not been discussed much when it comes to housing needs but they suffer the financial and social consequences of insufficient affordable housing as much as lower income individuals economic development i will continue to support economic development incentives and tools used for projects that create new jobs in kansas city particularly projects that are in severely distressed census tracts that address affordable and workforce housing erik dickinson dickinson is a native

issues economic development for many families in kansas city the american dream is no longer in reach working families are struggling to climb up into the middle class no matter how hard they work the past few decades have seen good paying jobs like those at general motors and ford diminish with fewer and fewer viable stepping stones for families seeking their share of the american dream without families making ends meet it leaves many youth vying for ancillary ways to survive by any means even despite known consequences education our young people are the future of this city we must invest now to cultivate a city that gives them pride and opens doors for all we need more job training and skill building and have opportunities to increase graduation rates we need to bridge the gap between our most at risk youth and the sustainable trade jobs that are actively seeking new talent we also need to support the continued efforts of our schools to provide quality educational seats to every child no matter their zip codes crime every citizen deserves to feel safe in our city we cannot create healthy and happy communities when we have portions of the city suffering from crime and violence we must approach these hardships with an integrated approach by supporting our police department with the resources they need to be effective creating a clear path from high school to the work force for our young people and reinforcing our local organizations who work diligently to fortify our communities and fill these gaps we must find innovative solutions that are working in other cities and

causes and candidates that support social justice and ensure that all are providing an opportunity to succeed on the issues crime public safety investment has to be a tenant and priority of our budget through providing more officers on the streets and greater engagement with the community to stem the unacceptable violence in our city we also need to encourage the community to work with police to deter crime and solve crimes that have been committed by building better relationships as we address public safety we must consider the underlying causes that contribute to violent crime and mental health living wage jobs and adequate affordable housing must be part of the conversation education education and especially early education is critical to the development and well being of our youngest citizens as a council and an entire city we need to work with the school districts and our civic and charitable partners to assist with finding ways to provide access to early childhood education after school activities and summer jobs and internships which will help provide a framework in which to address other issues that affect our city affordable housing the city s approach to addressing affordable housing and the lack thereof must be a multi level approach that includes a focus on those with low incomes creating approximately 5 000 units around transit schools and jobs as part of the program and policy we must expand the minor home repair program and create energy efficient weatherization programs to reduce utility costs finally as part of the program we must work to provide quality jobs so that individuals can afford to own or rent a home economic development economic development when planned and developed appropriately can be critical to attracting development new jobs and residents to an area however incentives to construct those projects should be used only when there is a need and demonstrated city wide public benefit all stakeholders could benefit from a pro active plan specifically related to the use of development incentives that takes the strategic goals outlined in advance kc and outlines 1 criteria for use of incentives 2 areas of the city

school board sub district three manny abarca bio my name is manuel abarca iv and i am the son of a truck driver and administrative assistant who gave their all to ensure i focused on and was successful in my academic pursuits i have earned a b a in political science and a m s in occupational safety management from the university of central missouri and have been accepted into the educational leadership and policy analysis educational doctorate program at the university of missouri i am the vice president of the indian mound neighborhood association and secretary of the northeast chamber of commerce board of directors among several other community governing boards i currently serve as the deputy director for congressman emanuel cleaver s district offices why are you running i have decided to run for the school board because i believe the district needs someone who is willing to take on challenges and further focus all efforts on the success of our students it was only through education that i have been able to define my own success and having spent many of my formative years in a very urban environment i understand the realities that our students face daily my plan is to focus on three main areas that i look forward to sharing more about community equity and progress what do you hope to bring to the table as a school board member as mentioned before i want to focus on three tenants within my first two years community equity and progress for community my plan is to better communicate with all constituents of the district and not simply those who have students that attend our schools find ways to build community around our buildings and turning them into more than just schools for equity we must find a way to hold all our educational institutions accountable and ensure they are playing with the same set of rules for our kids while also providing every student with the tools they need to succeed no matter where they may be performing finally progress this tenant speaks directly to the baseline of where we need to be a year full accreditation so that we can then focus on honing our product to be competitive in this educational environment i am a product of the public education system and proud of that i merely look to help out where i can where do you stand on kcmo question 1 i am adamantly opposed to the effort i fundamentally believe that we as kansas citians are being overtaxed for these sound good but chaotic ideas without real substance or buy in from the broader community not one public school system supports the pre k initiative on the ballot and that alone should tell you there is something wrong furthermore if we were to recoup on 3 million dollars from tax incentives that are otherwise going towards the pockets of wealthy developers kcps could expand the pre k efforts we already operate in a move towards universal pre k for all students finally within the first five years of the current pre k proposal funds will focus on the building of infrastructure instead of educating children and i do not believe we should take a short cut to create something that only sounds like a good idea lets come together and find a way to make pre k a reality without further burdening taxpayers how will you build upon what the current school board has done we must look beyond full accreditation and start dreaming about what will truly set us apart from our competition question 1 pre k economic development sales tax shall the city of kansas city impose a sales tax authorized by section 67 1305 of the revised statutes of missouri for a period of 10 years at a rate of 3 8 to be used for economic development purposes through funding pre k instruction for four and five year olds the year before they enter kindergarten funding improvements to early childhood centers and investing in the city s early childhood education workforce
risks ruining economy to win votes by prof tissa vitarana courtesy ceylon today the 2019 budget comes as the last one of this government the people have experienced four years of an open market economy and practically everyone in different walks of life complain that they feel dissatisfied find it difficult to work and live the way they did before and want a change before 2015 the economy grew by 7 now it is down to 3 this budget seeks not only to continue the downward path but with greater intensity when it has failed both here and abroad even the usa that started the drive for a free market economy is now forced to resort to regulation by the government to control market forces but this unf government is marching on to economic and political suicide for the whole country unless it is rejected by the people the 2019 budget presented by the finance minister mangala samaraweera fm is based on false premises and promises and will hasten the deepening of the economic crisis facing sri lanka leading to bankruptcy in the attempt to win votes for the unf at the forthcoming elections the lssp appeals to the people not to be misled by the fm s marketing skills but understand the grave outcome of this budget for the country and the people both present and future generations mangala samaraweera is the most irresponsible fm in sri lanka s history policy is more debt burden people not rich the income required to fulfil his promises is not going to be realised when the income rose by a mere 5 in 2018 can his prediction of an increase of 22 in 2019 be achieved the obvious shortfall will have to come via more loans thus the budget deficit of rs 685 billion will be much greater and the foreign borrowing will have to far exceed the rs 450 billion stated by him the government debt to gdp ratio that has risen to 83 6 at the end of 2018 from the 2017 level of 77 6 will sky rocket to well over 90 his claim that the government hopes to bring the load of debt down to 72 of gdp by 2022 is a dream an ahas maligawa to quote him election budget the third highest contributor to income is going to be rs 45 billion through the vehicle tax on imports fm hopes to increase vehicle imports by removal of the advance payment of 200 which is now levied but this will require more forex us dollars etc and worsen the adverse balance of trade this means more depreciation of the value of the rupee increasing the cost of living further and more usd loans resorting to printing of more money by government would also have similar consequences the increase of tax revenue is not by extending the tax burden to the rich and super rich the 1 of the population whose maximum tax slab remains at 24 but by broadening the indirect tax vat etc burden on the ordinary people the 99 the cost of living will soar making living impossible for the people while we welcome some features of the budget like the increase in excise duty on cigarettes and liquor to realise rs 370 billion and also the benefits to the people drinking water toilets rural roads free milk for school children student training programmes steps for women s welfare increased allowances for public servants and the handicapped and correction of pension anomalies the million dollar question is how much of this will be implemented there are various figures on how much of the promises have been implemented by the unf government during these last four years and some say that it may be as low as 30 will that be the ultimate outcome of this budget as well the fact that there is no mention of the rs 50 daily allowance promised to plantation workers in the budget is a pointer mp digambaran when do you quit crony capitalism with imf conditions there is no doubt that the bulk of the expenditure will be used for vote catching purposes for example we all accept that many who really need samurdhi assistance under this pretext the deserving opposition supporters who are getting benefits may lose out to even undeserving unp supporters the rate of economic growth which was 6 to 7 of gdp under the previous mahinda rajapaksa regime despite the cost of the war to restore peace and the extensive infrastructure development has dropped to just 3 with this unf government the fm expects to increase growth to at least 4 with the expectation that gamperaliya and enterprise sri lanka together with an increase of industrial development would achieve this but indications are that these two programmes are merely benefitting the unf crony capitalists and not the country and in in this election year the trend is likely to be aggravated amidst much talk of increasing export income when markets for traditional exports are collapsing there is no serious attempt to develop industries here even based on value addition to local raw materials that are capable of competing with foreign goods the need to have modern hi tech science technology and innovation developed locally is not really appreciated though lip service is paid the expectation that foreign direct investment fdi will make up for this is doomed to failure since 2015 the fdi outflow has exceeded the inflow the corrupt unstable political and economic situation in the country is not going to encourage investment the unf government commitments to the imf are being stringently fulfilled dismantling of the social welfare state and the sale of national assets to foreign multinational corporations with draining abroad of our forex usd etc the people and the economy will be badly hit the running down of state banks and other institutions in favour of the private sector will cause a rise in interest rates increased exploitation leading to the sale of farmers land and the assets of smes the high running cost and interest rates have led to closure of many enterprises the unrestricted open market policies are enabling foreign goods to capture our markets and dictate prices with local middlemen raking in profits both local producers and consumers suffer in such a context the budget rather than improving the life of the people will make it much worse election bribes through the budget will not make up for this

significant progress that we have been making in executing our plan in addition to updating you on arcos dorados financial performance please turn to slide 3 around this time last year we hosted an investor day in new york and shared with you our plans to strengthen our arcos dorados dominant leadership position in latin america this strategy is focused on our restaurants our food and our people we have the region s largest restaurant chain and can leverage our leading share in a segment of the informal eating out category but it s growing faster than any other dining out segment our growth plan is attracting more customers more often to our restaurants this strategy is aligned with mcdonald s global velocity growth plan and involves open new restaurants as well as physically upgrading and adding digital capabilities to existing ones we ll focus on being better not just bigger these restaurants confirm with the experience of the future design and offer modern service features such as self ordering kiosks and other convenience elements we re emphasizing an enhanced value experience and growing operating efficiencies over simply expanding our footprint eotf is working like our grouping ph restaurants eotf restaurants also feature in many of menus of high quality meals and desserts for great value it is giving us a competitive edge and increasing revenues as we intended we have consistently made investments in bringing our guest to most model environment and the best food and hospitality in the qsr segment i m happy to report that we have already delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion resulting from back to back margin improvements with a 120 basis point increase in the fourth quarter last year this time we projected that we would deliver adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 100 basis points to 200 basis points within two years to three years in these challenging times we have been able to reinforce our value for money equation given the efficiencies we re achieving at digital level and through our supply chain and additionally we continue to deliver g a leverage for the year our adjusted ebitda grew 18 9 in constant currency terms which was well above blended inflation and a nice increase 3 5 in dollars despite the sharp depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso our slad results reflected the strength of our geographic diversification inaudible is also included in the slad and that business in the country produced strong results supporting the stability of the division s margin on the cost side of our business we drove the parallel line down 2 percentage points on revenues in the quarter with favorable productivity gains to our employee scheduling system we also kept food and paper costs under control and our consolidated g a expense line was down 9 4 in dollar terms year over year now the execution of our strategy will remain long term focused and we will continue to emphasize pace quality and service these are at the heart of our approach to differentiate the mcdonald s brand and offering and as i said last april in new york we re always investing in our brand that s why we gained market share again in 2018 and expect to capture even more this year the sales have improved and the brazil economy was slower than we expected we are closely monitoring the government s announced initiatives we remain optimistic that once the reforms are in place the economy will resume growth in the meantime as we mentioned last year we will turn out the promotional side of our marketing calendar to capture early increases in consumption in terms of nolad we re particularly pleased with the result within the mexico where we recorded our seventh consecutive quarter of sale increases which were well above inflation so i ve begun my remarks by describing our growth strategy we accounted for a big part of arcos dorados improved performance during the second half of the year and what we re seeing so far in 2019 so with that in mind i will turn the call over to marcelo who will update you on our investments and the great progress we re making in pulling them in place marcelo rabach chief operating officer thank you sergio please turn to slide 4 our three pillar approach is focused on first creating inviting memorable restaurants with modern service features second offering the best and most appealing menu you can find in the qsr industry in latin america and the caribbean and finally training employees to deliver the highest quality of service across several platforms these qualities are the essence of our brand and are helping us not only to retain existing customers but to convert casual ones into committed customers what does this mean they are visiting our restaurants over and over again and by offering value across our menu board we are regaining customers we have lost to lower tier competitors i ll first go over update on this front where we naturally start with the first pillar our restaurants under the accelerated eotf deployment plan that we presented in april last year we set a target of approximately 650 eotf restaurants by the end of 2019 during the year every opening in brazil argentina and uruguay in addition to restaurants that were modernized brought the total eotf restaurants to 329 at december 31st well we remain on track to reach our target and most important we are seeing the mid single digit sales lift that we planned for let me highlight that we are funding all of these investments with available cash and cash that we generate turning to our food pillar in brazil we continue to expand on our successful signature line with the launch of mcpicanha and duplo picanha premium burgers we also added to our mcflurry line up in the dessert category new flavors with great inaudible a very important initiative that brings our customers closer to the brand food quality standards is puertas abiertas or open doors it brings them behind the counter and into our kitchens last year over 2 million brazilian customers participated in this program and across the region over 3 5 million we are the only qsr restaurant that proactively opens its kitchens to its customers in nolad the launch of the big tasty campaign contributed to our objective of growing volumes we continued with the popular chipotle ranch burger which is part of the signature line here we also added to the dessert category with the launch of mccoloso and mcfloat happy meal also performed well with the animal jam and spiderman properties in both brazil and nolad we launched black friday initiatives with promotions based on iconic products in slad we launched the big mac baco in the core segment and continued the popular egg bacon premium burger in the signature line we are tying in promotions through our app more and more which helped mitigate the soft consumer environment in argentina nintendo and animal jam featured in the happy meal and the new snacks platform is doing very well across the caribbean the third category performed well as we continued to introduce new flavors to the classic mcflurry the launch of the book of toy campaign also supported happy meal sales we are very proud of the fact that since 2013 as part of our commitment to promote reading among children and young people arcos dorados has distributed more than 14 million books with happy meals across latin america and the caribbean regarding people our cooltura de servicio program continues to drive improvement in terms of employee commitment customer satisfaction and our business results in a recent survey of our employees close to 90 said they were very satisfied in their role this partly explains the significant reduction in crew turnover since 2016 as well as our consistent rankings as the best place to work for example we were among the top three in ecuador panama and uruguay in 2018 besides productivity gains these initiatives are also elevating our guest dining experience resulting in significant improvement in our customer service function scores we also continue to make progress with our delivery platform delivery is contributing incremental sales and profits overall at the end of 2018 we offer the delivery service in 10 countries and we recently entered our 11th market we are the most searched for restaurant brand on the leading delivery apps brazil our largest market almost 400 of our restaurants now deliver compared to 300 at the end of the third quarter we are the most downloaded app in the qsr space in latin america increasing our ability to speak directly to our customers our app is now available in all 20 of the territories where we operate with downloads growing to over 21 million from 17 million at the end of the third quarter as a result of our innovative marketing efforts we were recognized by the mobile marketing association as latin america s mobile marketer of the year the quality of our creative work coupled with how we are optimizing our media channels is also increasing our media return on investment we know that we are connecting with our core customers families in the way they want to connect with us as we have increased our share of the family business in this segment our market share is 3 times that of our closest competitor before turning the call over to mariano i wanted to highlight an area of innovation that we are excited about we have been piloting a hand free payment system in our drive throughs this initiative is a partnership with sem parar a hands free payment system for toll booths throughout brazil through this exclusive three year relationship we have already rolled out hands free payment of approximately 100 restaurants in the state of sao paulo consistent with other initiatives to provide faster and more convenient service we plan to extend this system to many more of our restaurants across the country slide 5 summarizes the progress made on restaurant openings bringing us to 2 223 restaurants at the end of the year here you can see details on our footprint by store type as well as company and franchise operated restaurants with that i will turn the call over to mariano who will discuss the details of our key financial and operating results with you mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer thanks marcelo during our investor day last april we had the opportunity to share with you the results of our turnaround plan as well as our goals and expectations for the coming years i am very pleased with the progress we made thus far we closed the year with an adjusted ebitda of 292 million and the margin of 9 7 the highest since we became a public company in 2011 our focus on bringing more guests to our restaurants more often coupled with our efforts to streamline our cost structure drove an adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 90 basis points year over year although 2018 turned out to be more challenging on the macroeconomic front than we and the rest of the market had anticipated back then we achieved almost half of our margin expansion goal in less than a year we continue to gain additional g a leverage and most importantly without compromising on quality or limiting our future growth potential now moving to our fourth quarter results on slide 6 starting with our top line total revenues increased 9 1 in constant currency terms supported by a 7 5 growth in comparable sales mainly driven by average check growth as reported revenues continued to be impacted by the sharp depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso please turn to slide 7 moving on to our cost structure through the implementation of several cost optimization initiatives we continued to improve productivity at our restaurants this resulted in significant savings in payroll costs as a percentage of revenues in all our divisions despite our increased level of investments our g a expenses decreased by 6 2 million in absolute terms or 9 4 year over year mainly due to higher efficiencies we also benefited from the depreciation of the argentine peso and the brazilian real please turn to slide 8 adjusted ebitda in dollar terms decreased 2 2 and increased 13 7 in constant currency with our margin expanding 120 basis points to 11 7 adjusted ebitda in fourth quarter 2017 benefited from higher proceeds from refranchising activity compared to fourth quarter 2018 if we exclude these proceeds from both periods the adjusted ebitda margin would have expanded 190 basis points year over year moving to the bottom line we generated 18 9 million of net income during the quarter compared to 63 9 million in the same period last year this variation was mainly due to the 35 6 million from redevelopment initiatives in 2017 looking at full year 2018 and excluding costs related to the liability management initiatives that we undertook in march 2017 we achieved a net interest expense reduction of around 6 5 million per year please turn to slide 9 for more detail on our divisional results in brazil as we indicated on our last call we focused on rebalancing growth and profitability we started to see the results of this mainly toward the end of the quarter and more so in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy moving to slad i would like to highlight that we delivered outstanding results in chile during the quarter our geographic diversification strategy helped to mitigate the impact of strong macroeconomic headwinds in argentina top line performance in nolad and the caribbean remained on track posting comparable sales above blended inflation in the quarter the momentum continues in mexico where we posted our seventh consecutive quarter of strong comparable sales growth please turn to slide 10 in brazil adjusted ebitda decreased 13 6 in dollars and increased 1 6 in constant currency terms the margin reached 19 1 down 30 basis points mainly due to higher refranchising proceeds in the previous year s quarter excluding refranchising activity the margin would have expanded 100 basis points driven by efficiencies in payroll royalty fees and g a in nolad our adjusted ebitda margin contracted 130 basis points mostly due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions in both panama and costa rica in slad our adjusted ebitda margin remained stable at 8 9 adjusted ebitda in the caribbean was 8 3 million compared to 5 2 million in 2017 our margin there expanded 290 basis points mainly on efficiencies in food and paper costs and g a expenses turning to slide 11 as always we remain focused on driving long term shareholder value not only did we accelerate our capex program to support faster eotf deployment we also made a dividend payment of 21 million to our shareholders and repurchased shares for a total of 46 million in 2018 moreover we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet ending the year with a net leverage ratio of 1 5 times adjusted ebitda this was well below our target range of 2 times to 2 5 times as a remainder our leverage ratios are calculated using consolidated as reported results that concludes the review of our financial and operating results sergio has some additional remarks before the q a portion of this call sergio up to you sergio alonso chief executive officer thanks mariano we re gaining share and growing our business in latin america through a combination of a focused strategy with many initiatives we believe that this is the right approach to delivering long term shareholder value and in the short term i am pleased to announce that our board approved a dividend for 2019 of 0 11 per share i always like to finish our quarterly earnings calls with an update and our commitment is capable as this is part of our dna today i would like to focus on youth employment and equality ph which are among the united nations sustainable development goals to reduce inequality in the world as we announced earlier this year arcos dorados expects to employ more than 55 000 team members in latin america and the caribbean an 8 increase compared to 2018 most important these jobs provide professional development for the many young people who make up the vast majority of our workforce this includes the training they receive through our cooltura de servicio program and career advancement at arcos dorados over last three years approximately 150 000 of the jobs that we generated in latin america and the caribbean were for people between the ages of 17 and 25 including those who belong to vulnerable parts of society for many of these young people it s their first formal job arcos dorados remains a catalyst for change in this front we are expanding our interest through public private partnerships with various foundations dedicated to significantly reducing youth employment these include instituto ayrton senna in brazil cimientos in argentina colombia and uruguay forge in chile and peru neo in colombia and the international youth foundation which operates globally we are also extremely proud to recognized by the united nations for our best practices in employing and providing opportunities for people with disabilities this is the highest honor we could win in this area as the company has been investing more and more in social inclusion and development arcos dorados has also been leveraging our scale to encourage reading among children and trusted ph family bonding since 2013 we have distributed 14 million books to families of latin america and the caribbean as part of the happy meal reader book program and with that thank you very much for your continued support and let s open the call up for questions so operator please proceed questions and answers operator yes thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from melissa byun with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead melissa byun bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you can you discuss some of the promotional and marketing efforts in brazil that and going into the first quarter and the level of traction that you re seeing in sales and then should we be prepared for some margin pressure as a result or are there efficiencies or other sources of savings that you think can offset investment thanks sergio alonso chief executive officer okay good morning melissa this is sergio thank you for your clear question let you recall when we released the third quarter results in november last year we anticipated that what happened to us back then was the market didn t recover that as we expected and would sort of reacted slowly to that new set of conditions so we actually changed the profile of our monthly calendar toward the end of the year and we mentioned back then that you should expect effectively well about the significant increase in our comp sales performance which is happening as we re speaking to you of course we will not disclose q1 numbers but you ll see it in q1 release as a consequence of that obviously there are two forces that are working at the some time one side would try to mitigate the impact of increasing the promotional component because as you said that creates margin pressures but we have several levers to offset that pressure and that is what we re doing today and also inaudible from mariano telling mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer yes let me add some color on the answer sergio hi melissa as sergio mentioned we are very pleased with the trend that we were seeing in the first couple of months of this year and comp sales looks like will be well above inflation for this quarter and as you know when we are able to do that typically we see leverage in several cost lines in the p l so that s that s happening and that will help us to support some of the investment we are making through food and paper and at the same time we are very confident that our marketing plans for the rest of the year will continue to support restaurant traffic because the increase in sales is coming both from our check but from additional traffic so i think that we are in the right path in the right direction in brazil and very pleased with the signs that we got in the first couple of months melissa byun bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s good to hear thank you sergio alonso chief executive officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from robert schweich with rbm capital please go ahead with your question robert schweich rmb capital management llc analyst good morning the big problem in your reported results has to do with currency and i don t think there is very much you can do about that but there is something you can consider that might be somewhat offsetting for stockholders the effect of the share repurchase program in terms of 6 million shares on a 200 million share base is de minimis the 0 11 cash dividend possibly is too small considering the earning power of the business and i would suggest that you put more emphasis on a higher cash dividend policy and less on the share repurchase program as i think that could be a partial offset to the disappointment in reported earnings because of the currency that s a comment i wanted to make to the entire organization with regard to the looking forward i d like to hear more much more discussion on brazil and the impact of the new political party and how you see this unfolding because the latest information that i m reading is its popularity has diminished somewhat but i don t know if that is very significant and i d like to hear a lot more comment on that and any comments you want to make on the financial comment i made also would be welcome sergio alonso chief executive officer yes good morning thank you bob and by the way thank you for your comment and my remark on brazil situation would be look there is a heightened level of expectation in the market about the reform that will be approved by the congress by mid year it is expected that the reform will go through the congress by june 30 that will bring much more certainty to the current market conditions and that will help us obviously to revisit the marketing calendar we have if the economy resumes growth on a higher pace we may shift back to a more previous direction that we used to have in our actions that means less promotional activities having said all that the reality is that as marcelo said in the recent question what we are seeing so far it s a very nice recovery in our sales levels and that is adding to our optimism because we believe that if having the degree of uncertainty that we still have in the market we are being capable to get these kinds of results in terms of sales growth that we see it a signal of what lays ahead once the reform is approved and that piece of uncertainty is sort of banished if you will so things that we cannot control sure are fx but the reality is that even beyond the fx factor we were able to manage our ebitda last year and maybe grow 3 5 in spite of all the headwinds that we have had that way not only in brazil but also in argentina mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer i m sorry let me add one thing hi bob this is mariano regarding the fx of course the depreciation of the real and the argentine peso has an effect on our on our results regarding argentina always keep in mind that in argentina we have a natural hedge because we have our corporate structure based here so actually the depreciation of the argentine peso has an effect on our business but at the same time it helps us to reduce as i mentioned during my speech that has a positive effect on our g a and if you look at our bottom line results i think we did a wonderful a very good job regarding how we managed the business and you can see that in our ebitda margin but taking into account that venezuela is impacting in our results by 50 million in our net income and that has a non cash nature so actually you know it doesn t affect the cash generation of the business so without those 50 million on the net income coming from venezuela i think the results of the business was not that bad and we were able to overcome the depreciation of the real because the argentine peso has an effect believe it it s as i mentioned before operator operator instructions seeing that there are no further questions i d now like to turn the conference back over to mr alonso sergio alonso chief executive officer yes thank you actually before we close or let s say mariano as you said a minute ago the reality is that the results that we re releasing today are heavily impacted by a couple of factors that are clearly beyond our control currency depreciation being the most relevant and venezuela whose results are actually a function of the currency volatility that the markets suffered in 2018 but i believe that the real performance of the business is very different from what our eps is showing there is a lot going on today in the company there is a lot going on in the system we are speeding up the investment process we are investing in our restaurant base we are modernizing at a we believe at a very good pace on restaurant base and that is paying off we ve seen the reaction of our customers to those investments and that is creating i would say a very realistic deal of optimism in the short term future of arcos dorados we are managing the business for the long run that s what we always have done that is what we always do we have very talent management team we have a very robust succession plan as well and believe me we will see great results in our business in short term and i believe we have one additional question it looks like operator we do mr alonso and last question comes from thor solanes with hsbc please go ahead thor solanes hsbc analyst hi good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask if you can please share more details on the mac delivery performance maybe how our same store sales performing in the main markets and what is the share of sales in these markets from this source thanks sergio alonso chief executive officer okay delivery is a market space that is growing very very fast but it s not only in our region but worldwide we obviously being the leader in latin america we have to be part of that business even though this is not something new for us in fact we offer delivery in some of our countries for many many years but the reality is what happened is there was a major change in the business model will be now with operation of these companies when we call it three deals which are the logistic operators if you will that created a positive treat to the p l of this segment and that is why we re moving real quick in this segment we have as we said before 400 restaurants already operating in brazil and we also have mexico colombia costa rica peru argentina and chile are some of the markets and hence growing it is growing at highest pace though it is not big in terms of relative terms yet we believe that delivery has the capacity obviously to grow over time and we see it as an incremental business we don t see trading off between customers that actually visit our restaurants and customers that will order delivery in their houses or on a work basis so marcelo can you add to that marcelo rabach chief operating officer i think that you said almost everything but i want to emphasize that on top of bringing incremental sales it s a profitable it s a very profitable segment for us so i think that we have the great kind of deals we ve been with many partners we are working with in the region and we are very confident that this will be a very

background foreign investment what is the prevailing attitude towards foreign investment before the transition from communism in 1989 to 1990 act xxiv of 1988 on the investments of foreigners in hungary the foreign investment act was enacted to protect and attract foreign investment in hungary as a result of ensuing liberalisation during the past 25 years most of its specific rules have been set aside however the remaining rules continue to reflect a welcoming attitude towards foreign investors providing important guarantees such as full protection and security the immediate compensation of damages resulting from nationalisation expropriation or other similar legal measures affecting the ownership rights of foreign nationals to the value and currency in which the investment was made with the possibility of a court review of the decision on compensation the hungarian investment promotion agency hipa is the government organisation assisting potential foreign investors seeking information about their investment with regard to already settled foreign investors the hungarian government s most recent policy is to conclude strategic agreements with the most important investors ensuring that the particular investor will receive an instant and comprehensive insight into the legislative changes affecting its industry what are the main sectors for foreign investment in the state according to the most recent data from the hungarian central office of statistics foreign direct investment is concentrated in terms of sectors and origin the statistics show that 83 per cent of foreign direct investment fdi is concentrated in four sectors manufacturing 36 per cent real property 20 per cent commerce 15 per cent and finance 12 per cent out of manufacturing automotive manufacturing electrical information technology optical and medical appliance manufacturing pharmaceuticals and food processing are the most important fields other important sectors are biotechnology

approximately 2 7 billion in 2016 divestments outpaced investments resulting in a negative inflow of us 5 3 billion but this is generally considered a temporary setback owing to specific circumstances

countries for newly created employment investment agreement legislation describe domestic legislation governing investment agreements with the state or state owned entities there is no specific legal

model bit does the state have a model bit hungary does not have a model bit at the moment preparatory materials does the state have a central repository of treaty preparatory materials are such materials publicly available according to act l of 2005 on the procedure relating to international treaties the minister in charge of foreign policy is responsible for keeping the original copies of international treaties and a register of the most important data relating to such treaties according to the law the register should be available on the internet the registry is available at www kulugyminiszterium hu szerzodes main aspx furthermore the international law department of the ministry of foreign affairs and trade provides information upon request treaty preparatory materials are usually kept with the ministry in charge of negotiations at the time in practice the chances of locating and accessing them are variable the national archives of hungary also keeps records of international treaties and diplomatic correspondence these are researchable upon request documents relating to foreign affairs are available at www digitarchiv hu scope and coverage what is the typical scope of coverage of investment treaties typically investment treaties have a broad definition of both investor and investment the definition of investment usually includes every kind of asset invested in connection with economic activities the most important types of investment are generally listed in a non exhaustive list including movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem such as mortgages liens pledges and similar rights shares stocks and debentures of companies or any other form of participation in a company claims to money or to any performance having an economic value associated with an investment intellectual and industrial property rights including copyrights trademarks patents designs rights of breeders technical processes know how trade secrets geographical indications trade names and goodwill associated with an investment and rights conferred by law or under contract and any licences and permits pursuant to law 8 such as concessions returns of investments are often explicitly qualified as investment it is often agreed that any alteration of the form of investment shall not affect their character as investment the definition of investor is similarly extensive and generally includes any natural or legal person of one contracting party that has made an investment in the territory of the other contracting party in the case of natural persons this requires having the nationality of either contracting party in the case of legal persons this requires a legal entity incorporated or constituted in accordance with the laws of one contracting party in many cases it is also required that the legal entity has its central administration or principal place of business in the territory of the contracting party some of the most recent bits allow the contracting parties to deny the benefits of the treaty to an investor of the other contracting party if investors of a non contracting party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities in the territory of the contracting party under whose law it is constituted in this case the contracting parties may also deny the benefits of the treaties to an investor of the other contracting party or an investment of such contracting party and to investments of such investor this will occur if investors of a non contracting party own or control the investment and the denying contracting party adopts or maintains measures with respect to the non contracting party that prohibit transactions with the investment or that would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of the agreement were accorded to the investments of investors protections what substantive protections are typically available typically investment treaties provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in certain cases for example the treaty with italy this is completed with an express prohibition of discrimination virtually every investment treaty provides a national and most favoured nation mfn treatment of the investment the scope of the mfn clauses vary but often include compensation for losses owing to wars emergencies and similar situations treaties also guarantee the free transfer of returns and recognition of the subrogation of investors rights and claim to export or credit guarantee institutions of the investor s state typically hungarian bits contain no umbrella clauses some of the earlier treaties contain umbrella clauses which may be rather vague for example the uk hungary bit sets forth that contracting parties shall observe any obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other contracting party treaties without exception protect against expropriation typically setting out that expropriation or measures with equivalent effect can only be carried out for a public purpose under due process of law on a non discriminatory basis with prompt adequate and effective compensation the exact rules however vary dispute resolution what are the most commonly used dispute resolution options for investment disputes between foreign investors and your state every investment protection treaty provides investor state arbitration although the scope varies in many cases arbitration is limited to disputes relating to expropriation almost all bits provide for a mandatory cooling period of six months available for amicable settlement the most commonly used dispute resolution option is icsid in many cases there is a possibility of ad hoc arbitration according to uncitral rules upon the choice of the investor a minority of bits contain consent to submit the dispute to icc in paris or the arbitration institute of the stockholm chamber of commerce a minority of treaties require exhaustion of local remedies or contain fork in the road provisions setting forth that once a dispute is submitted to any court or arbitration tribunal the choice is final and cannot be changed in particular recent bits set a period of limitation to enforce claims confidentiality does the state have an established practice of requiring confidentiality in investment arbitration we are not aware of any publicly established or stated practice according to publicly available information hungary requested confidentiality in two cases emmis v hungary arb 12 2 and accession v hungary arb 12 3 out of 15 pending or concluded cases however the scope of these requests is not publicly available according to icsid s official website out of the nine cases concluded

enforcement such as the 1958 un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards hungary promulgated the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york convention by law decree no 25 of 1962 with the following reservation the hungarian people s republic shall apply the convention to the recognition and enforcement of such awards only as have been made in the territory of one of the other contracting states and are dealing with differences arising in respect of a legal relationship considered by the hungarian law as a commercial relationship award compliance does the state usually comply voluntarily with investment treaty awards rendered against it before 2016 there was only one publicly available adc v hungary arb 03 16 and one reported edf international sa v republic of hungary uncitral international arbitration award where hungary was ordered to pay damages to the investor in accordance with the award rendered on 13 december 2016 in edenred v hungary arb 13 21 hungary was also ordered to pay damages to the investor in april 2017 hungary filed an application for the annulment of the award although the ad hoc committee has not rendered its award yet hungary has complied with it in accordance with the above we are not aware of any public information according to which hungary failed to voluntarily comply with the award we are also not aware of any indication that hungary would not fully comply with a potential international investment arbitration award in the future unfavourable awards if not does the state appeal to its domestic courts or the courts where the arbitration was seated against unfavourable awards hungary initiated a lawsuit for the annulment of the award rendered in edf international sa v republic of hungary uncitral the swiss federal supreme court rejected the appeal of hungary in october 2015 in april 2017 hungary filed an application for annulment of the award rendered in the edenred v hungary arb 13 21 case the ad hoc committee has not rendered its award yet provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory in the case of enforcement of judgments or awards in hungary against a foreign state section 85 of xxviii of 2017 on private international law must be observed this rule recognises sovereign immunity in connection with foreign states involved in hungarian enforcement proceedings setting forth that no enforcement can be conducted against a foreign state over an asset of such foreign state located in hungary which serves the purpose of fulfilling the state s public powers and the operation of its bodies in contrast no similar rule exists in connection with enforcements against the hungarian state therefore such procedures are subject to the ordinary rules of enforcement according to which the enforcement is to be conducted over the entirety of the assets of the debtor the exceptions are assets listed in hungarian legal rules as belonging exclusively to the state these include riverbeds radio frequencies and monuments as well as shares in certain state owned companies such assets are listed in a number of different legal rules in particular the national assets act
the reserve bank of new zealand joined in the central bank dovishness and signaled its next move is likely a rate cut the risk of a more pronounced global downturn has increased it said the market also expects a rate cut by the fed this year but is it necessary when us growth is still strong the big news on wednesday morning comes from the overnight rbnz meeting and the sharp move lower in the new zealand dollar the central bank got straight to the point in its statement the official cash rate ocr remains at 1 75 percent given the weaker global economic outlook and reduced momentum in domestic spending the more likely direction of our next ocr move is down some dovishness was expected given the direction taken by the fed and the rba in australia but such a strong signal was a surprise the economic outlook was given a gloomier forecast too they continued we expect ongoing low interest rates and increased government spending and investment to support economic growth over 2019 as capacity pressures build consumer price inflation is expected to rise to around the mid point of our target range at 2 percent the balance of risks to this outlook has shifted to the downside the risk of a more pronounced global downturn has increased and low business sentiment continues to weigh on domestic spending on the upside inflation could rise faster if firms pass on cost increases to prices to a greater extent advertisement yield curve concerns meanwhile traders have been watching the odds of a fed cut which is possible as early as june the probabilities of a june cut according to market pricing were 28 early this week but these fell to around 20 later on tuesday odds of september cut are much higher hovering around the 60 mark with around 80 chance in 2019 as a whole one of the reasons for this expectation apart from the ultra dovish shift and growth concerns is the inverting yield curve which is a problem for banks and a dampener on sentiment as it often signals a recession down the road but how worried should the market be here s ing with some insight an inverted yield curve has preceded all last nine recessions so such an event is typically cited as an indicator of impending doom indeed the new york federal reserve has a recession indicator based on the 3m 10y spread and even before the current inversion the probability of recession was pegged at 24 6 however it s important to remember that it has given false signals before and we have to acknowledge the distorting influence of the federal reserve s large qe driven balance sheet which has helped to keep longer dated treasury yields low this could well be a false signal again and the fed could steepen the curve and prevent it inverting by cutting rates the yield curve is influenced by many different things and if the concern is slowing growth then a look at the data might put these fears to rest the atlanta fed nowgdp model is currently running at 1 2 for 1q gdp growth versus just 0 2 a couple of weeks ago as more data comes in we look for a 1 5 2 outcome for 1q gdp annualised growth which wouldn t be too bad given the tendency in recent years for 1q gdp to disappoint continue ing so the situation may not be as dire as the market seems to think which means if the fed do actually cut rates this year into a strong economy it could ignite a continuation of the large stock rally we have already seen meanwhile the usd is likely to remain flat until either the us economy slows down or the economies of other g10 countries pick up if data in the eurozone could really bottom and turn higher rate cuts in the us will boost the eurusd
publicidad pr newswire vancouver march 26 2019 b2gold s directors have approved the expansion vancouver march 26 2019 prnewswire b2gold corp tsx bto nyse american btg nsx b2g b2gold or the company is pleased to announce very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine located in mali and that the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa all dollar figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated the expansion study pea was conducted to evaluate the life of mine lom options for expanded mining and processing to maximize the value of the substantially increased indicated and inferred mineral resource at the fekola mine see news release dated october 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production results of this study recommend an expansion of the existing plant to process an additional 1 5 mtpa resulting in a baseline capacity of 7 5 mtpa without requiring an additional ball mill or additional power generation capacity based on the new optimized mine plan the mining rate at fekola will also be increased along with additional mining equipment to accelerate the supply of higher grade ore to the expanded processing facilities as a result of the project and mineral resource expansion the fekola mine will produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous lom mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study preliminary economic assessment will be realized highlights of fekola expansion study pea during the expansion study other upside opportunities were identified and are currently under review these will be incorporated into an updated fekola lom plan when related studies are complete and if they show an increase in overall project value upside opportunities identified to date include renewable energy focused on a solar plant alternative tailings storage co disposal paste dry stack and others waste mining various fleet options vs in pit crushing and conveying and the potential incorporation of material from the anaconda mineral resource basis of the study on october 25 2018 the company announced a substantial increase in the mineral resource for the fekola mine and positive results from the conceptual stage of the expansion study b2gold reported an indicated mineral resource of 92 8 million tonnes at a grade of 1 92 grams per tonne g t containing 5 73 million ounces and an inferred mineral resource of 26 5 million tonnes at a grade of 1 61 g t containing 1 37 million ounces see news release dated 10 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production this expanded resource coupled with positive results of an internal conceptual study formed the basis of and motivation for the expansion study pea mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability based on positive results of the conceptual fekola expansion study the company continued testing and design with the same lycopodium brisbane team which performed engineering and design work for the current fekola mill and infrastructure and contracted whittle consulting whittle to work together with the company s technical team to conduct an enterprise optimization study of the fekola project results have confirmed the value of the processing expansion and recommend a corresponding increase in mining capacity whittle evaluated mining production rates pit and phase scheduling dynamic cut off grades ore stockpiling blending and dynamic processing throughput and recovery to maximize project npv these parameters will continue to be optimized during the next phases of project design and implementation in the meantime the company is nearing completion on front end engineering and design feed for the expansion with a focus on long lead items the project schedule indicates that the processing expansion will be fully operational by q4 2020 b2gold is currently investigating the potential to accelerate this schedule based on the availability of long lead items as currently envisioned the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which will be commissioned in q3 2020 in parallel with the expansion b2gold is studying the addition of a solar power plant which would reduce operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions the current on site power plant has sufficient capacity to support the expanded processing throughput with or without the solar plant the current mining fleet consists of four caterpillar 6020b excavators with haul trucks drills and support equipment to match and mines an average of 36 mtpa the whittle results currently indicate that mining production rates ranging from 54 mtpa to 76 mtpa are optimal to support the expanded processing rates over the lom and optimize head grade during the period 2020 2024 increased production will be achieved with the addition of two to four excavators with corresponding trucks drills and support equipment large front end loaders would also be included to maintain fleet flexibility mine fleet expansion timing and scale will be optimized during q2 2019 and will generally be equipment loan lease financed over a five year period the study has included 28 million for expansion to 54 mtpa and an additional 28 million for a total of 56 million to go to 76 mtpa in parallel with the whittle study b2gold is reviewing in pit crushing and conveying as a means to reduce operating costs and potentially implement tailings and waste co disposal at the fekola mine b2gold is also considering the option of transporting the nearby anaconda saprolite material to fekola for processing see news release dated 06 15 2017 with the combination of the increased indicated and inferred mineral resource and implementation of the processing expansion and mining expansion the fekola mine will see a substantial increase in annual and lom gold production and revenues revised lom cash operating cash costs and aisc are estimated at below 500 and 700 per ounce respectively despite mining a larger open pit at slightly lower gold grade under the pea low costs are forecast to be maintained through the new extended fekola mine life due to economies of scale arising from increased mining and processing rates and the optimized mining schedule during the five year period 2020 2024 under the new optimized lom aisc are expected to average approximately 630 per ounce current pea expansion estimates indicate approximate annual gold production averaging over 400 000 ounces per year over the new lom including 2019 with over 550 000 ounces per year over the five year period 2020 2024 total processed tonnage currently included in the expansion study pea consists of approximately 84 million tonnes processed over the lom period 2019 2030 at a grade of 1 9 g t producing approximately 5 0 million ounces prior to 2019 the fekola mine produced more than 550 000 ounces from its operations since inception the fekola resources remain open to the north and down plunge head grade may be optimized to an average of up to 2 3 g t over the period 2020 2024 with an increased mining rate and ore stockpiling under the current expansion study pea assumptions mine life extends to 12 years including 2019 into 2030 even with the increased processing rate of 7 5 mtpa mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability upside potential b2gold s technical team along with lycopodium whittle consulting and others continues to study and optimize several components of the fekola mine ongoing studies include optimizing the mine production schedule and stockpile strategy adding solar power reviewing various tailings and waste disposal strategies and the potential to process material from the anaconda project located to the north through the fekola plant these studies will continue through q2 2019 and will be incorporated into a revised fekola lom plan which is expected to be available by the end of q1 2020 since january 2019 up to seven drill rigs have completed 27 drill holes focussed on infill drilling the inferred portion of the new fekola mineral resource 21 to indicated so that an updated geologic and grade model can be completed in late 2019 this will allow the engineering group to complete an updated design pit and new mineral reserves along with an updated fekola lom plan by the end of q1 2020 once infill drilling is completed at the end of q2 2019 b2gold plans to immediately dedicate exploration drill rigs to test several targets with the potential to expand the mineral resources these targets include the fekola north area beyond the current resource boundary that remains open along strike and down plunge the cardinal structures west of the operating mine and the fekola south area where previous wide spaced drilling has shown potential for additional mineralization below the main fekola orebody in addition in early q3 drill rigs will be mobilized to the anaconda region to continue efforts to expand the previously announced shallow saprolite resource as well as further tests for hard rock mineralization targets below the saprolite resource about b2gold corp headquartered in vancouver canada b2gold corp is the world s new senior gold producer founded in 2007

turn the call over to our ceo sergio alonso sergio alonso chief executive officer thank you inaki good day everyone and thank you for joining us today on this call we want to update you on the significant progress that we have been making in executing our plan in addition to updating you on arcos dorados financial performance please turn to slide 3 around this time last year we hosted an investor day in new york and shared with you our plans to strengthen our arcos dorados dominant leadership position in latin america this strategy is focused on our restaurants our food and our people we have the region s largest restaurant chain and can leverage our leading share in a segment of the informal eating out category but it s growing faster than any other dining out segment our growth plan is attracting more customers more often to our restaurants this strategy is aligned with mcdonald s global velocity growth plan and involves open new restaurants as well as physically upgrading and adding digital capabilities to existing ones we ll focus on being better not just bigger these restaurants confirm with the experience of the future design and offer modern service features such as self ordering kiosks and other convenience elements we re emphasizing an enhanced value experience and growing operating efficiencies over simply expanding our footprint eotf is working like our grouping ph restaurants eotf restaurants also feature in many of menus of high quality meals and desserts for great value it is giving us a competitive edge and increasing revenues as we intended we have consistently made investments in bringing our guest to most model environment and the best food and hospitality in the qsr segment i m happy to report that we have already delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion resulting from back to back margin improvements with a 120 basis point increase in the fourth quarter last year this time we projected that we would deliver adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 100 basis points to 200 basis points within two years to three years in these challenging times we have been able to reinforce our value for money equation given the efficiencies we re achieving at digital level and through our supply chain and additionally we continue to deliver g a leverage for the year our adjusted ebitda grew 18 9 in constant currency terms which was well above blended inflation and a nice increase 3 5 in dollars despite the sharp depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso our slad results reflected the strength of our geographic diversification inaudible is also included in the slad and that business in the country produced strong results supporting the stability of the division s margin on the cost side of our business we drove the parallel line down 2 percentage points on revenues in the quarter with favorable productivity gains to our employee scheduling system we also kept food and paper costs under control and our consolidated g a expense line was down 9 4 in dollar terms year over year now the execution of our strategy will remain long term focused and we will continue to emphasize pace quality and service these are at the heart of our approach to differentiate the mcdonald s brand and offering and as i said last april in new york we re always investing in our brand that s why we gained market share again in 2018 and expect to capture even more this year the sales have improved and the brazil economy was slower than we expected we are closely monitoring the government s announced initiatives we remain optimistic that once the reforms are in place the economy will resume growth in the meantime as we mentioned last year we will turn out the promotional side of our marketing calendar to capture early increases in consumption in terms of nolad we re particularly pleased with the result within the mexico where we recorded our seventh consecutive quarter of sale increases which were well above inflation so i ve begun my remarks by describing our growth strategy we accounted for a big part of arcos dorados improved performance during the second half of the year and what we re seeing so far in 2019 so with that in mind i will turn the call over to marcelo who will update you on our investments and the great progress we re making in pulling them in place marcelo rabach chief operating officer thank you sergio please turn to slide 4 our three pillar approach is focused on first creating inviting memorable restaurants with modern service features second offering the best and most appealing menu you can find in the qsr industry in latin america and the caribbean and finally training employees to deliver the highest quality of service across several platforms these qualities are the essence of our brand and are helping us not only to retain existing customers but to convert casual ones into committed customers what does this mean they are visiting our restaurants over and over again and by offering value across our menu board we are regaining customers we have lost to lower tier competitors i ll first go over update on this front where we naturally start with the first pillar our restaurants under the accelerated eotf deployment plan that we presented in april last year we set a target of approximately 650 eotf restaurants by the end of 2019 during the year every opening in brazil argentina and uruguay in addition to restaurants that were modernized brought the total eotf restaurants to 329 at december 31st well we remain on track to reach our target and most important we are seeing the mid single digit sales lift that we planned for let me highlight that we are funding all of these investments with available cash and cash that we generate turning to our food pillar in brazil we continue to expand on our successful signature line with the launch of mcpicanha and duplo picanha premium burgers we also added to our mcflurry line up in the dessert category new flavors with great inaudible a very important initiative that brings our customers closer to the brand food quality standards is puertas abiertas or open doors it brings them behind the counter and into our kitchens last year over 2 million brazilian customers participated in this program and across the region over 3 5 million we are the only qsr restaurant that proactively opens its kitchens to its customers in nolad the launch of the big tasty campaign contributed to our objective of growing volumes we continued with the popular chipotle ranch burger which is part of the signature line here we also added to the dessert category with the launch of mccoloso and mcfloat happy meal also performed well with the animal jam and spiderman properties in both brazil and nolad we launched black friday initiatives with promotions based on iconic products in slad we launched the big mac baco in the core segment and continued the popular egg bacon premium burger in the signature line we are tying in promotions through our app more and more which helped mitigate the soft consumer environment in argentina nintendo and animal jam featured in the happy meal and the new snacks platform is doing very well across the caribbean the third category performed well as we continued to introduce new flavors to the classic mcflurry the launch of the book of toy campaign also supported happy meal sales we are very proud of the fact that since 2013 as part of our commitment to promote reading among children and young people arcos dorados has distributed more than 14 million books with happy meals across latin america and the caribbean regarding people our cooltura de servicio program continues to drive improvement in terms of employee commitment customer satisfaction and our business results in a recent survey of our employees close to 90 said they were very satisfied in their role this partly explains the significant reduction in crew turnover since 2016 as well as our consistent rankings as the best place to work for example we were among the top three in ecuador panama and uruguay in 2018 besides productivity gains these initiatives are also elevating our guest dining experience resulting in significant improvement in our customer service function scores we also continue to make progress with our delivery platform delivery is contributing incremental sales and profits overall at the end of 2018 we offer the delivery service in 10 countries and we recently entered our 11th market we are the most searched for restaurant brand on the leading delivery apps brazil our largest market almost 400 of our restaurants now deliver compared to 300 at the end of the third quarter we are the most downloaded app in the qsr space in latin america increasing our ability to speak directly to our customers our app is now available in all 20 of the territories where we operate with downloads growing to over 21 million from 17 million at the end of the third quarter as a result of our innovative marketing efforts we were recognized by the mobile marketing association as latin america s mobile marketer of the year the quality of our creative work coupled with how we are optimizing our media channels is also increasing our media return on investment we know that we are connecting with our core customers families in the way they want to connect with us as we have increased our share of the family business in this segment our market share is 3 times that of our closest competitor before turning the call over to mariano i wanted to highlight an area of innovation that we are excited about we have been piloting a hand free payment system in our drive throughs this initiative is a partnership with sem parar a hands free payment system for toll booths throughout brazil through this exclusive three year relationship we have already rolled out hands free payment of approximately 100 restaurants in the state of sao paulo consistent with other initiatives to provide faster and more convenient service we plan to extend this system to many more of our restaurants across the country slide 5 summarizes the progress made on restaurant openings bringing us to 2 223 restaurants at the end of the year here you can see details on our footprint by store type as well as company and franchise operated restaurants with that i will turn the call over to mariano who will discuss the details of our key financial and operating results with you mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer thanks marcelo during our investor day last april we had the opportunity to share with you the results of our turnaround plan as well as our goals and expectations for the coming years i am very pleased with the progress we made thus far we closed the year with an adjusted ebitda of 292 million and the margin of 9 7 the highest since we became a public company in 2011 our focus on bringing more guests to our restaurants more often coupled with our efforts to streamline our cost structure drove an adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 90 basis points year over year although 2018 turned out to be more challenging on the macroeconomic front than we and the rest of the market had anticipated back then we achieved almost half of our margin expansion goal in less than a year we continue to gain additional g a leverage and most importantly without compromising on quality or limiting our future growth potential now moving to our fourth quarter results on slide 6 starting with our top line total revenues increased 9 1 in constant currency terms supported by a 7 5 growth in comparable sales mainly driven by average check growth as reported revenues continued to be impacted by the sharp depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso please turn to slide 7 moving on to our cost structure through the implementation of several cost optimization initiatives we continued to improve productivity at our restaurants this resulted in significant savings in payroll costs as a percentage of revenues in all our divisions despite our increased level of investments our g a expenses decreased by 6 2 million in absolute terms or 9 4 year over year mainly due to higher efficiencies we also benefited from the depreciation of the argentine peso and the brazilian real please turn to slide 8 adjusted ebitda in dollar terms decreased 2 2 and increased 13 7 in constant currency with our margin expanding 120 basis points to 11 7 adjusted ebitda in fourth quarter 2017 benefited from higher proceeds from refranchising activity compared to fourth quarter 2018 if we exclude these proceeds from both periods the adjusted ebitda margin would have expanded 190 basis points year over year moving to the bottom line we generated 18 9 million of net income during the quarter compared to 63 9 million in the same period last year this variation was mainly due to the 35 6 million from redevelopment initiatives in 2017 looking at full year 2018 and excluding costs related to the liability management initiatives that we undertook in march 2017 we achieved a net interest expense reduction of around 6 5 million per year please turn to slide 9 for more detail on our divisional results in brazil as we indicated on our last call we focused on rebalancing growth and profitability we started to see the results of this mainly toward the end of the quarter and more so in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy moving to slad i would like to highlight that we delivered outstanding results in chile during the quarter our geographic diversification strategy helped to mitigate the impact of strong macroeconomic headwinds in argentina top line performance in nolad and the caribbean remained on track posting comparable sales above blended inflation in the quarter the momentum continues in mexico where we posted our seventh consecutive quarter of strong comparable sales growth please turn to slide 10 in brazil adjusted ebitda decreased 13 6 in dollars and increased 1 6 in constant currency terms the margin reached 19 1 down 30 basis points mainly due to higher refranchising proceeds in the previous year s quarter excluding refranchising activity the margin would have expanded 100 basis points driven by efficiencies in payroll royalty fees and g a in nolad our adjusted ebitda margin contracted 130 basis points mostly due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions in both panama and costa rica in slad our adjusted ebitda margin remained stable at 8 9 adjusted ebitda in the caribbean was 8 3 million compared to 5 2 million in 2017 our margin there expanded 290 basis points mainly on efficiencies in food and paper costs and g a expenses turning to slide 11 as always we remain focused on driving long term shareholder value not only did we accelerate our capex program to support faster eotf deployment we also made a dividend payment of 21 million to our shareholders and repurchased shares for a total of 46 million in 2018 moreover we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet ending the year with a net leverage ratio of 1 5 times adjusted ebitda this was well below our target range of 2 times to 2 5 times as a remainder our leverage ratios are calculated using consolidated as reported results that concludes the review of our financial and operating results sergio has some additional remarks before the q a portion of this call sergio up to you sergio alonso chief executive officer thanks mariano we re gaining share and growing our business in latin america through a combination of a focused strategy with many initiatives we believe that this is the right approach to delivering long term shareholder value and in the short term i am pleased to announce that our board approved a dividend for 2019 of 0 11 per share i always like to finish our quarterly earnings calls with an update and our commitment is capable as this is part of our dna today i would like to focus on youth employment and equality ph which are among the united nations sustainable development goals to reduce inequality in the world as we announced earlier this year arcos dorados expects to employ more than 55 000 team members in latin america and the caribbean an 8 increase compared to 2018 most important these jobs provide professional development for the many young people who make up the vast majority of our workforce this includes the training they receive through our cooltura de servicio program and career advancement at arcos dorados over last three years approximately 150 000 of the jobs that we generated in latin america and the caribbean were for people between the ages of 17 and 25 including those who belong to vulnerable parts of society for many of these young people it s their first formal job arcos dorados remains a catalyst for change in this front we are expanding our interest through public private partnerships with various foundations dedicated to significantly reducing youth employment these include instituto ayrton senna in brazil cimientos in argentina colombia and uruguay forge in chile and peru neo in colombia and the international youth foundation which operates globally we are also extremely proud to recognized by the united nations for our best practices in employing and providing opportunities for people with disabilities this is the highest honor we could win in this area as the company has been investing more and more in social inclusion and development arcos dorados has also been leveraging our scale to encourage reading among children and trusted ph family bonding since 2013 we have distributed 14 million books to families of latin america and the caribbean as part of the happy meal reader book program and with that thank you very much for your continued support and let s open the call up for questions so operator please proceed questions and answers operator yes thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from melissa byun with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead melissa byun bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you can you discuss some of the promotional and marketing efforts in brazil that and going into the first quarter and the level of traction that you re seeing in sales and then should we be prepared for some margin pressure as a result or are there efficiencies or other sources of savings that you think can offset investment thanks sergio alonso chief executive officer okay good morning melissa this is sergio thank you for your clear question let you recall when we released the third quarter results in november last year we anticipated that what happened to us back then was the market didn t recover that as we expected and would sort of reacted slowly to that new set of conditions so we actually changed the profile of our monthly calendar toward the end of the year and we mentioned back then that you should expect effectively well about the significant increase in our comp sales performance which is happening as we re speaking to you of course we will not disclose q1 numbers but you ll see it in q1 release as a consequence of that obviously there are two forces that are working at the some time one side would try to mitigate the impact of increasing the promotional component because as you said that creates margin pressures but we have several levers to offset that pressure and that is what we re doing today and also inaudible from mariano telling mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer yes let me add some color on the answer sergio hi melissa as sergio mentioned we are very pleased with the trend that we were seeing in the first couple of months of this year and comp sales looks like will be well above inflation for this quarter and as you know when we are able to do that typically we see leverage in several cost lines in the p l so that s that s happening and that will help us to support some of the investment we are making through food and paper and at the same time we are very confident that our marketing plans for the rest of the year will continue to support restaurant traffic because the increase in sales is coming both from our check but from additional traffic so i think that we are in the right path in the right direction in brazil and very pleased with the signs that we got in the first couple of months melissa byun bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s good to hear thank you sergio alonso chief executive officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from robert schweich with rbm capital please go ahead with your question robert schweich rmb capital management llc analyst good morning the big problem in your reported results has to do with currency and i don t think there is very much you can do about that but there is something you can consider that might be somewhat offsetting for stockholders the effect of the share repurchase program in terms of 6 million shares on a 200 million share base is de minimis the 0 11 cash dividend possibly is too small considering the earning power of the business and i would suggest that you put more emphasis on a higher cash dividend policy and less on the share repurchase program as i think that could be a partial offset to the disappointment in reported earnings because of the currency that s a comment i wanted to make to the entire organization with regard to the looking forward i d like to hear more much more discussion on brazil and the impact of the new political party and how you see this unfolding because the latest information that i m reading is its popularity has diminished somewhat but i don t know if that is very significant and i d like to hear a lot more comment on that and any comments you want to make on the financial comment i made also would be welcome sergio alonso chief executive officer yes good morning thank you bob and by the way thank you for your comment and my remark on brazil situation would be look there is a heightened level of expectation in the market about the reform that will be approved by the congress by mid year it is expected that the reform will go through the congress by june 30 that will bring much more certainty to the current market conditions and that will help us obviously to revisit the marketing calendar we have if the economy resumes growth on a higher pace we may shift back to a more previous direction that we used to have in our actions that means less promotional activities having said all that the reality is that as marcelo said in the recent question what we are seeing so far it s a very nice recovery in our sales levels and that is adding to our optimism because we believe that if having the degree of uncertainty that we still have in the market we are being capable to get these kinds of results in terms of sales growth that we see it a signal of what lays ahead once the reform is approved and that piece of uncertainty is sort of banished if you will so things that we cannot control sure are fx but the reality is that even beyond the fx factor we were able to manage our ebitda last year and maybe grow 3 5 in spite of all the headwinds that we have had that way not only in brazil but also in argentina mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer i m sorry let me add one thing hi bob this is mariano regarding the fx of course the depreciation of the real and the argentine peso has an effect on our on our results regarding argentina always keep in mind that in argentina we have a natural hedge because we have our corporate structure based here so actually the depreciation of the argentine peso has an effect on our business but at the same time it helps us to reduce as i mentioned during my speech that has a positive effect on our g a and if you look at our bottom line results i think we did a wonderful a very good job regarding how we managed the business and you can see that in our ebitda margin but taking into account that venezuela is impacting in our results by 50 million in our net income and that has a non cash nature so actually you know it doesn t affect the cash generation of the business so without those 50 million on the net income coming from venezuela i think the results of the business was not that bad and we were able to overcome the depreciation of the real because the argentine peso has an effect believe it it s as i mentioned before operator operator instructions seeing that there are no further questions i d now like to turn the conference back over to mr alonso sergio alonso chief executive officer yes thank you actually before we close or let s say mariano as you said a minute ago the reality is that the results that we re releasing today are heavily impacted by a couple of factors that are clearly beyond our control currency depreciation being the most relevant and venezuela whose results are actually a function of the currency volatility that the markets suffered in 2018 but i believe that the real performance of the business is very different from what our eps is showing there is a lot going on today in the company there is a lot going on in the system we are speeding up the investment process we are investing in our restaurant base we are modernizing at a we believe at a very good pace on restaurant base and that is paying off we ve seen the reaction of our customers to those investments and that is creating i would say a very realistic deal of optimism in the short term future of arcos dorados we are managing the business for the long run that s what we always have done that is what we always do we have very talent management team we have a very robust succession plan as well and believe me we will see great results in our business in short term and i believe we have one additional question it looks like operator we do mr alonso and last question comes from thor solanes with hsbc please go ahead thor solanes hsbc analyst hi good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask if you can please share more details on the mac delivery performance maybe how our same store sales performing in the main markets and what is the share of sales in these markets from this source thanks sergio alonso chief executive officer okay delivery is a market space that is growing very very fast but it s not only in our region but worldwide we obviously being the leader in latin america we have to be part of that business even though this is not something new for us in fact we offer delivery in some of our countries for many many years but the reality is what happened is there was a major change in the business model will be now with operation of these companies when we call it three deals which are the logistic operators if you will that created a positive treat to the p l of this segment and that is why we re moving real quick in this segment we have as we said before 400 restaurants already operating in brazil and we also have mexico colombia costa rica peru argentina and chile are some of the markets and hence growing it is growing at highest pace though it is not big in terms of relative terms yet we believe that delivery has the capacity obviously to grow over time and we see it as an incremental business we don t see trading off between customers that actually visit our restaurants and customers that will order delivery in their houses or on a work basis so marcelo can you add to that marcelo rabach chief operating officer i think that you said almost everything but i want to emphasize that on top of bringing incremental sales it s a profitable it s a very profitable segment for us so i think that we have the great kind of deals we ve been with many partners we are working with in the region and we are very confident that this will be a very important driver of our increasing sales and profits going forward sergio alonso chief executive officer it s actually very small when compared to total volume we do yet but with a huge capacity to grow i believe you will listen about this a lot more in the future surely thor solanes hsbc analyst thank you very much sergio alonso chief executive officer you re welcome operator and then at this time there are no further questions mr alonso is there anymore concluding remarks sergio alonso chief executive officer no no thank you and again thank you all for your questions for your attention and have a good day operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect your lines duration 45 minutes call participants patricio esnaola

washington april 23 2018 remittances to low and middle income countries rebounded to a record level in 2017 after two consecutive years of decline says the world bank s latest migration and development brief the bank estimates that officially recorded remittances to low and middle income countries reached 466 billion in 2017 an increase of 8 5 percent over 429 billion in 2016 global remittances which include flows to high income countries grew 7 percent to 613 billion in 2017 from 573 billion in 2016 the stronger than expected recovery in remittances is driven by growth in europe the russian federation and the united states the rebound in remittances when valued in u s dollars was helped by higher oil prices and a strengthening of the euro and ruble remittance inflows improved in all regions and the top remittance recipients were india with 69 billion followed by china 64 billion the philippines 33 billion mexico 31 billion nigeria 22 billion and egypt 20 billion remittances are expected to continue to increase in 2018 by 4 1 percent to reach 485 billion global remittances are expected to grow 4 6 percent to 642 billion in 2018 longer term risks to growth of remittances include stricter immigration policies in many remittance source countries also de risking by banks and increased regulation of money transfer operators both aimed at reducing financial crime continue to constrain the growth of formal remittances the global average cost of sending 200 was 7 1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 more than twice as high as the sustainable development goal target of 3 percent sub saharan africa remains the most expensive place to send money to where the average cost is 9 4 percent major barriers to reducing remittance costs are de risking by banks and exclusive partnerships between national post office systems and money transfer operators these factors constrain the introduction of more efficient technologies such as internet and smartphone apps and the use of cryptocurrency and blockchain in remittance services while remittances are growing countries institutions and development agencies must continue to chip away at high costs of remitting so that families receive more of the money eliminating exclusivity contracts to improve market competition and introducing more efficient technology are high priority issues said dilip ratha lead author of the brief and head of knomad in a special feature the brief notes that transit migrants who only stay temporarily in a transit country are usually not able to send money home migration may help them escape poverty or persecution but many also become vulnerable to exploitation by human smugglers during the transit host communities in the transit countries may find their own poor population competing with the new comers for low skill jobs the world bank group is mobilizing financial resources and knowledge on migration to support migrants and countries with the aim of reducing poverty and sharing prosperity our focus is on addressing the fundamental drivers of migration and supporting the migration related sustainable development goals and the global compact on migration said michal rutkowski senior director of the social protection and jobs global practice at the world bank multilateral agencies can help by providing data and technical assistance to address adverse drivers of transit migration while development institutions can provide financing solutions to transit countries origin countries need to empower embassies in transit countries to assist transit migrants the global compact on migration prepared under the auspices of the united nations sets out objectives for safe orderly and regular migration currently under negotiation for final adoption in december 2018 the global compact proposes three international migration review forums in 2022 2026 and 2030 the world bank group and knomad stand ready to contribute to the implementation of the global compact regional remittance trends remittances to the east asia and pacific region rebounded 5 8 percent to 130 billion in 2017 reversing a decline of 2 6 percent in 2016 remittance to the philippines grew 5 3 percent in 2017 to 32 6 billion flows to indonesia are expected to grow 1 2 percent to 9 billion in 2017 reversing the previous year s sharp decline stronger growth in transfers from countries in southeast asia helped offset lower remittance flows from other regions particularly the middle east and the united states remittances to the region are expected to grow 3 8 percent to 135 billion in 2018 remittances to countries in europe and central asia grew a rapid 21 percent to 48 billion in 2017 after three consecutive years of decline main reasons for the growth are stronger growth and employment prospects in the euro area russia and kazakhstan the appreciation of the euro and ruble against the u s dollar and the low comparison base after a nearly 22 percent decline in 2015 remittances in 2018 will moderate as the region s growth stabilizes with remittances expected to grow 6 percent to 51 billion remittances flows into latin america and the caribbean grew 8 7 percent in 2017 reaching another record high of nearly 80 billion main factors for the growth are stronger growth in the united states and tighter enforcement of u s immigration rules which may have impacted remittances as migrants remitted savings in anticipation of shorter stays in the united states remittance growth was robust in mexico 6 6 percent el salvador 9 7 percent colombia 15 percent guatemala 14 3 honduras 12 percent and nicaragua 10 percent in 2018 remittances to the region are expected to grow 4 3 percent to 83 billion backed by improvement in the u s labor market and higher growth prospects for italy and spain remittances to the middle east and north africa grew 9 3 percent to 53 billion in 2017 driven by strong flows to egypt in response to more stable exchange rate expectations however the growth outlook is dampened by tighter foreign worker policies in saudi arabia in 2018 cuts in subsidies increase in various fees and the introduction of a value added tax in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have increased the cost of living for expatriate workers in 2018 growth in remittances to the region is expected to moderate to 4 4 percent to 56 billion remittances to south asia grew a moderate 5 8 percent to 117 billion in 2017 remittances to many countries appear to be picking up after the slowdown in 2016 remittances to india picked up sharply by 9 9 percent to 69 billion in 2017 reversing the previous year s sharp decline flows to pakistan and bangladesh were both largely flat in 2017 while sri lanka saw a small decline 0 9 percent in 2018 remittances to the region will likely grow modestly by 2 5 percent to 120 billion remittances to sub saharan africa accelerated 11 4 percent to 38 billion in 2017 supported by improving economic growth in advanced economies and higher oil prices benefiting regional economies the largest remittance recipients were nigeria 21 9 billion senegal 2 2 billion and ghana 2 2 billion the region is host to several countries where remittances are a significant share of gross domestic product including liberia 27 percent the gambia 21 percent and comoros 21 percent in 2018 remittances to the region are expected to grow 7 percent to 41 billion the migration and development brief and the latest migration and remittances data are available at www knomad org interact with migration experts

our people we have the region s largest restaurant chain and can leverage our leading share in a segment of the informal eating out category but it s growing faster than any other dining out segment our growth plan is attracting more customers more often to our restaurants this strategy is aligned with mcdonald s global velocity growth plan and involves open new restaurants as well as physically upgrading and adding digital capabilities to existing ones we ll focus on being better not just bigger these restaurants confirm with the experience of the future design and offer modern service features such as self ordering kiosks and other convenience elements we re emphasizing an enhanced value experience and growing operating efficiencies over simply expanding our footprint eotf is working like our grouping ph restaurants eotf restaurants also feature in many of menus of high quality meals and desserts for great value it is giving us a competitive edge and increasing revenues as we intended we have consistently made investments in bringing our guest to most model environment and the best food and hospitality in the qsr segment i m happy to report that we have already delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion resulting from back to back margin improvements with a 120 basis point increase in the fourth quarter last year this time we projected that we would deliver adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 100 basis points to 200 basis points within two years to three years in these challenging times we have been able to reinforce our value for money equation given the efficiencies we re achieving at digital level and through our supply chain and additionally we continue to deliver g a leverage for the year our adjusted ebitda grew 18 9 in constant currency terms which was well above blended inflation and a nice increase 3 5 in dollars despite the sharp depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso our slad results reflected the strength of our geographic diversification inaudible is also included in the slad and that business in the country produced strong results supporting the stability of the division s margin advertisement advertisement on the cost side of our business we drove the parallel line down 2 percentage points on revenues in the quarter with favorable productivity gains to our employee scheduling system we also kept food and paper costs under control and our consolidated g a expense line was down 9 4 in dollar terms year over year now the execution of our strategy will remain long term focused and we will continue to emphasize pace quality and service these are at the heart of our approach to differentiate the mcdonald s brand and offering and as i said last april in new york we re always investing in our brand that s why we gained market share again in 2018 and expect to capture even more this year the sales have improved and the brazil economy was slower than we expected we are closely monitoring the government s announced initiatives we remain optimistic that once the reforms are in place the economy will resume growth in the meantime as we mentioned last year we will turn out the promotional side of our marketing calendar to capture early increases in consumption in terms of nolad we re particularly pleased with the result within the mexico where we recorded our seventh consecutive quarter of sale increases which were well above inflation so i ve begun my remarks by describing our growth strategy we accounted for a big part of arcos dorados improved performance during the second half of the year and what we re seeing so far in 2019 advertisement advertisement so with that in mind i will turn the call over to marcelo who will update you on our investments and the great progress we re making in pulling them in place marcelo rabach chief operating officer thank you sergio please turn to slide 4 our three pillar approach is focused on first creating inviting memorable restaurants with modern service features second offering the best and most appealing menu you can find in the qsr industry in latin america and the caribbean and finally training employees to deliver the highest quality of service across several platforms these qualities are the essence of our brand and are helping us not only to retain existing customers but to convert casual ones into committed customers what does this mean they are visiting our restaurants over and over again and by offering value across our menu board we are regaining customers we have lost to lower tier competitors i ll first go over update on this front where we naturally start with the first pillar our restaurants under the accelerated eotf deployment plan that we presented in april last year we set a target of approximately 650 eotf restaurants by the end of 2019 during the year every opening in brazil argentina and uruguay in addition to restaurants that were modernized brought the total eotf restaurants to 329 at december 31st well we remain on track to reach our target and most important we are seeing the mid single digit sales lift that we planned for let me highlight that we are funding all of these investments with available cash and cash that we generate advertisement advertisement turning to our food pillar in brazil we continue to expand on our successful signature line with the launch of mcpicanha and duplo picanha premium burgers we also added to our mcflurry line up in the dessert category new flavors with great inaudible a very important initiative that brings our customers closer to the brand food quality standards is puertas abiertas or open doors it brings them behind the counter and into our kitchens last year over 2 million brazilian customers participated in this program and across the region over 3 5 million we are the only qsr restaurant that proactively opens its kitchens to its customers in nolad the launch of the big tasty campaign contributed to our objective of growing volumes we continued with the popular chipotle ranch burger which is part of the signature line here we also added to the dessert category with the launch of mccoloso and mcfloat happy meal also performed well with the animal jam and spiderman properties in both brazil and nolad we launched black friday initiatives with promotions based on iconic products in slad we launched the big mac baco in the core segment and continued the popular egg bacon premium burger in the signature line we are tying in promotions through our app more and more which helped mitigate the soft consumer environment in argentina nintendo and animal jam featured in the happy meal and the new snacks platform is doing very well across the caribbean the third category performed well as we continued to introduce new flavors to the classic mcflurry the launch of the book of toy campaign also supported happy meal sales we are very proud of the fact that since 2013 as part of our commitment to promote reading among children and young people arcos dorados has distributed more than 14 million books with happy meals across latin america and the caribbean advertisement advertisement regarding people our cooltura de servicio program continues to drive improvement in terms of employee commitment customer satisfaction and our business results in a recent survey of our employees close to 90 said they were very satisfied in their role this partly explains the significant reduction in crew turnover since 2016 as well as our consistent rankings as the best place to work for example we were among the top three in ecuador panama and uruguay in 2018 besides productivity gains these initiatives are also elevating our guest dining experience resulting in significant improvement in our customer service function scores we also continue to make progress with our delivery platform delivery is contributing incremental sales and profits overall at the end of 2018 we offer the delivery service in 10 countries and we recently entered our 11th market we are the most searched for restaurant brand on the leading delivery apps brazil our largest market almost 400 of our restaurants now deliver compared to 300 at the end of the third quarter we are the most downloaded app in the qsr space in latin america increasing our ability to speak directly to our customers our app is now available in all 20 of the territories where we operate with downloads growing to over 21 million from 17 million at the end of the third quarter as a result of our innovative marketing efforts we were recognized by the mobile marketing association as latin america s mobile marketer of the year the quality of our creative work coupled with how we are optimizing our media channels is also increasing our media return on investment we know that we are connecting with our core customers families in the way they want to connect with us as we have increased our share of the family business in this segment our market share is 3 times that of our closest competitor advertisement advertisement before turning the call over to mariano i wanted to highlight an area of innovation that we are excited about we have been piloting a hand free payment system in our drive throughs this initiative is a partnership with sem parar a hands free payment system for toll booths throughout brazil through this exclusive three year relationship we have already rolled out hands free payment of approximately 100 restaurants in the state of sao paulo consistent with other initiatives to provide faster and more convenient service we plan to extend this system to many more of our restaurants across the country slide 5 summarizes the progress made on restaurant openings bringing us to 2 223 restaurants at the end of the year here you can see details on our footprint by store type as well as company and franchise operated restaurants with that i will turn the call over to mariano who will discuss the details of our key financial and operating results with you mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks marcelo during our investor day last april we had the opportunity to share with you the results of our turnaround plan as well as our goals and expectations for the coming years i am very pleased with the progress we made thus far we closed the year with an adjusted ebitda of 292 million and the margin of 9 7 the highest since we became a public company in 2011 our focus on bringing more guests to our restaurants more often coupled with our efforts to streamline our cost structure drove an adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 90 basis points year over year although 2018 turned out to be more challenging on the macroeconomic front than we and the rest of the market had anticipated back then we achieved almost half of our margin expansion goal in less than a year we continue to gain additional g a leverage and most importantly without compromising on quality or limiting our future growth potential now moving to our fourth quarter results on slide 6 starting with our top line total revenues increased 9 1 in constant currency terms supported by a 7 5 growth in comparable sales mainly driven by average check growth as reported revenues continued to be impacted by the sharp depreciation of the brazilian real and the argentine peso please turn to slide 7 moving on to our cost structure through the implementation of several cost optimization initiatives we continued to improve productivity at our restaurants this resulted in significant savings in payroll costs as a percentage of revenues in all our divisions despite our increased level of investments our g a expenses decreased by 6 2 million in absolute terms or 9 4 year over year mainly due to higher efficiencies we also benefited from the depreciation of the argentine peso and the brazilian real please turn to slide 8 adjusted ebitda in dollar terms decreased 2 2 and increased 13 7 in constant currency with our margin expanding 120 basis points to 11 7 adjusted ebitda in fourth quarter 2017 benefited from higher proceeds from refranchising activity compared to fourth quarter 2018 if we exclude these proceeds from both periods the adjusted ebitda margin would have expanded 190 basis points year over year moving to the bottom line we generated 18 9 million of net income during the quarter compared to 63 9 million in the same period last year this variation was mainly due to the 35 6 million from redevelopment initiatives in 2017 looking at full year 2018 and excluding costs related to the liability management initiatives that we undertook in march 2017 we achieved a net interest expense reduction of around 6 5 million per year please turn to slide 9 for more detail on our divisional results in brazil as we indicated on our last call we focused on rebalancing growth and profitability we started to see the results of this mainly toward the end of the quarter and more so in the first quarter of 2019 as we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy moving to slad i would like to highlight that we delivered outstanding results in chile during the quarter our geographic diversification strategy helped to mitigate the impact of strong macroeconomic headwinds in argentina top line performance in nolad and the caribbean remained on track posting comparable sales above blended inflation in the quarter the momentum continues in mexico where we posted our seventh consecutive quarter of strong comparable sales growth please turn to slide 10 in brazil adjusted ebitda decreased 13 6 in dollars and increased 1 6 in constant currency terms the margin reached 19 1 down 30 basis points mainly due to higher refranchising proceeds in the previous year s quarter excluding refranchising activity the margin would have expanded 100 basis points driven by efficiencies in payroll royalty fees and g a in nolad our adjusted ebitda margin contracted 130 basis points mostly due to the challenging macroeconomic conditions in both panama and costa rica in slad our adjusted ebitda margin remained stable at 8 9 adjusted ebitda in the caribbean was 8 3 million compared to 5 2 million in 2017 our margin there expanded 290 basis points mainly on efficiencies in food and paper costs and g a expenses turning to slide 11 as always we remain focused on driving long term shareholder value not only did we accelerate our capex program to support faster eotf deployment we also made a dividend payment of 21 million to our shareholders and repurchased shares for a total of 46 million in 2018 moreover we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet ending the year with a net leverage ratio of 1 5 times adjusted ebitda this was well below our target range of 2 times to 2 5 times as a remainder our leverage ratios are calculated using consolidated as reported results that concludes the review of our financial and operating results sergio has some additional remarks before the q a portion of this call sergio up to you sergio alonso chief executive officer thanks mariano we re gaining share and growing our business in latin america through a combination of a focused strategy with many initiatives we believe that this is the right approach to delivering long term shareholder value and in the short term i am pleased to announce that our board approved a dividend for 2019 of 0 11 per share i always like to finish our quarterly earnings calls with an update and our commitment is capable as this is part of our dna today i would like to focus on youth employment and equality ph which are among the united nations sustainable development goals to reduce inequality in the world as we announced earlier this year arcos dorados expects to employ more than 55 000 team members in latin america and the caribbean an 8 increase compared to 2018 most important these jobs provide professional development for the many young people who make up the vast majority of our workforce this includes the training they receive through our cooltura de servicio program and career advancement at arcos dorados over last three years approximately 150 000 of the jobs that we generated in latin america and the caribbean were for people between the ages of 17 and 25 including those who belong to vulnerable parts of society for many of these young people it s their first formal job arcos dorados remains a catalyst for change in this front we are expanding our interest through public private partnerships with various foundations dedicated to significantly reducing youth employment these include instituto ayrton senna in brazil cimientos in argentina colombia and uruguay forge in chile and peru neo in colombia and the international youth foundation which operates globally we are also extremely proud to recognized by the united nations for our best practices in employing and providing opportunities for people with disabilities this is the highest honor we could win in this area as the company has been investing more and more in social inclusion and development arcos dorados has also been leveraging our scale to encourage reading among children and trusted ph family bonding since 2013 we have distributed 14 million books to families of latin america and the caribbean as part of the happy meal reader book program and with that thank you very much for your continued support and let s open the call up for questions so operator please proceed

level of traction that you re seeing in sales and then should we be prepared for some margin pressure as a result or are there efficiencies or other sources of savings that you think can offset investment thanks sergio alonso chief executive officer okay good morning melissa this is sergio thank you for your clear question let you recall when we released the third quarter results in november last year we anticipated that what happened to us back then was the market didn t recover that as we expected and would sort of reacted slowly to that new set of conditions so we actually changed the profile of our monthly calendar toward the end of the year and we mentioned back then that you should expect effectively well about the significant increase in our comp sales performance which is happening as we re speaking to you of course we will not disclose q1 numbers but you ll see it in q1 release as a consequence of that obviously there are two forces that are working at the some time one side would try to mitigate the impact of increasing the promotional component because as you said that creates margin pressures but we have several levers to offset that pressure and that is what we re doing today and also inaudible from mariano telling mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer yes let me add some color on the answer sergio hi melissa as sergio mentioned we are very pleased with the trend that we were seeing in the first couple of months of this year and comp sales looks like will be well above inflation for this quarter and as you know when we are able to do that typically we see leverage in several cost lines in the p l so that s that s happening and that will help us to support some of the investment we are making through food and paper and at the same time we are very confident that our marketing plans for the rest of the year will continue to support restaurant traffic because the increase in sales is coming both from our check but from additional traffic so i think that we are in the right path in the right direction in brazil and very pleased with the signs that we got in the first couple of months melissa byun bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s good to hear thank you sergio alonso chief executive officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from robert schweich with rbm capital please go ahead with your question robert schweich rmb capital management llc analyst good morning the big problem in your reported results has to do with currency and i don t think there is very much you can do about that but there is something you can consider that might be somewhat offsetting for stockholders the effect of the share repurchase program in terms of 6 million shares on a 200 million share base is de minimis the 0 11 cash dividend possibly is too small considering the earning power of the business and i would suggest that you put more emphasis on a higher cash dividend policy and less on the share repurchase program as i think that could be a partial offset to the disappointment in reported earnings because of the currency that s a comment i wanted to make to the entire organization with regard to the looking forward i d like to hear more much more discussion on brazil and the impact of the new political party and how you see this unfolding because the latest information that i m reading is its popularity has diminished somewhat but i don t know if that is very significant and i d like to hear a lot more comment on that and any comments you want to make on the financial comment i made also would be welcome sergio alonso chief executive officer yes good morning thank you bob and by the way thank you for your comment and my remark on brazil situation would be look there is a heightened level of expectation in the market about the reform that will be approved by the congress by mid year it is expected that the reform will go through the congress by june 30 that will bring much more certainty to the current market conditions and that will help us obviously to revisit the marketing calendar we have if the economy resumes growth on a higher pace we may shift back to a more previous direction that we used to have in our actions that means less promotional activities having said all that the reality is that as marcelo said in the recent question what we are seeing so far it s a very nice recovery in our sales levels and that is adding to our optimism because we believe that if having the degree of uncertainty that we still have in the market we are being capable to get these kinds of results in terms of sales growth that we see it a signal of what lays ahead once the reform is approved and that piece of uncertainty is sort of banished if you will so things that we cannot control sure are fx but the reality is that even beyond the fx factor we were able to manage our ebitda last year and maybe grow 3 5 in spite of all the headwinds that we have had that way not only in brazil but also in argentina mariano tannenbaum chief financial officer i m sorry let me add one thing hi bob this is mariano regarding the fx of course the depreciation of the real and the argentine peso has an effect on our on our results regarding argentina always keep in mind that in argentina we have a natural hedge because we have our corporate structure based here so actually the depreciation of the argentine peso has an effect on our business but at the same time it helps us to reduce as i mentioned during my speech that has a positive effect on our g a and if you look at our bottom line results i think we did a wonderful a very good job regarding how we managed the business and you can see that in our ebitda margin but taking into account that venezuela is impacting in our results by 50 million in our net income and that has a non cash nature so actually you know it doesn t affect the cash generation of the business so without those 50 million on the net income coming from venezuela i think the results of the business was not that bad and we were able to overcome the depreciation of the real because the argentine peso has an effect believe it it s as i mentioned before operator operator instructions seeing that there are no further questions i d now like to turn the conference back over to mr alonso sergio alonso chief executive officer yes thank you actually before we close or let s say mariano as you said a minute ago the reality is that the results that we re releasing today are heavily impacted by a couple of factors that are clearly beyond our control currency depreciation being the most relevant and venezuela whose results are actually a function of the currency volatility that the markets suffered in 2018 but i believe that the real performance of the business is very different from what our eps is showing there is a lot going on today in the company there is a lot going on in the system we are speeding up the investment process we are investing in our restaurant base we are modernizing at a we believe at a very good pace on restaurant base and that is paying off we ve seen the reaction of our customers to those investments and that is creating i would say a very realistic deal of optimism in the short term future of arcos dorados we are managing the business for the long run that s what we always have done that is what we always do we have very talent management team we have a very robust succession plan as well and believe me we will see great results in our business in short term and i believe we have one additional question it looks like operator we do mr alonso and last question comes from thor solanes with hsbc please go ahead thor solanes hsbc analyst hi good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask if you can please share more details on the mac delivery performance maybe how our same store sales performing in the main markets and what is the share of sales in these markets from this source thanks sergio alonso chief executive officer okay delivery is a market space that is growing very very fast but it s not only in our region but worldwide we obviously being the leader in latin america we have to be part of that business even though this is not something new for us in fact we offer delivery in some of our countries for many many years but the reality is what happened is there was a major change in the business model will be now with operation of these companies when we call it three deals which are the logistic operators if you will that created a positive treat to the p l of this segment and that is why we re moving real quick in this segment we have as we said before 400 restaurants already operating in brazil and we also have mexico colombia costa rica peru argentina and chile are some of the markets and hence growing it is growing at highest pace though it is not big in terms of relative terms yet we believe that delivery has the capacity obviously to grow over time and we see it as an incremental business we don t see trading off between customers that actually visit our restaurants and customers that will order delivery in their houses or on a work basis so marcelo can you add to that marcelo rabach chief operating officer i think that you said almost everything but i want to emphasize that on top of bringing incremental sales it s a profitable it s a very profitable segment for us so i think that we have the great kind of deals we ve been with many partners we are working with in the region and we are very confident that this will be a very important driver of our increasing sales and profits going forward sergio alonso chief executive officer it s actually very small when compared to total volume we do yet but with a huge capacity to grow i believe you will listen about this a lot more in the future surely thor solanes hsbc analyst thank you very much sergio alonso chief executive officer you re welcome operator and then at this time there are no further questions mr alonso is there anymore concluding remarks sergio alonso chief executive officer no no thank you and again thank

cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision

cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision
cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision

by darini rajasingham senanayake the politics of distraction seemed to achieve new heights as the international court of justice icj ruled in one of the most important and long awaited cases of its history a month ago on february 25 in what has been termed a block buster judgment the united nation s highest court rejected the united kingdom s claim of sovereignty over the indian ocean chagos islands and determined that britain should return the islands to its former colony mauritius as rapidly as possible the icj ruling deemed uk s occupation of the indian ocean archipelago that houses the secretive united states diego garcia military base illegal under international law the same week by design or accident a flurry of international activity in the indo pacific glossed the landmark icj ruling global media was attention focused on donald trumps visit to vietnam to shake hands with north korea s kim jong un and fighting flared on the indo pakistan border in kashmir while in sri lanka media focused on the visit of former us ambassador to the united nations and harvard don samantha power who waxed eloquent about human rights to the island s political elite at the bmich ms power s discourse to felicitate finance minister mangala samaraweera discreetly made no reference to the icj ruling that effectively implies on going human rights violations against chagossians who were forcibly displaced from their island home in the 1960s not too far from the southern coast of sri lanka by the united kingdom in 2015 the us uk and allies took the govt of sri lanka to the unhrc and are holding it accountable for grave human rights violations during a 30 year armed conflict although the unravelling of european empires was one of the formative moments of the modern world system including the birth of south asian states the icj ruling that uk should end control of what it terms british indian ocean territory biot in 2019 underlines the fact that the process of de colonization is far from complete the uk took control of chagos islands from mauritius 50 years ago the british government then evicted the entire population before leasing one of its largest atolls to the united states to build a large military base diego garcia mauritius was in the middle of negotiating its independence from the uk at the time and repeatedly condemned the deal in february 2017 the un general assembly asked the icj to offer its opinion in on whether the process had been concluded lawfully mauritius argued that it was forced to give up the islands in 1965 in exchange for independence the icj ruled that the islands were not lawfully separated from the former colony of mauritius when uk broke off the islands from mauritius in 1965 it violated un resolution 1514 xv on decolonisation that argued against the break up of colonies the ruling puts the us naval base diego garcia in question and has implications for sri lanka and other small island nations in the io the heritage foundation in its recent report noted a us marine logistics hub is in the works in trincomalee a deep water natural harbour coveted by competing big powers in the indian ocean for years the diego garcia base has been vital to the military serving as a landing spot for bombers that fly missions across asia including over the south china sea the icj ruling which is advisory raises questions about its future as uk has a history of following icj rulings cnn quoted carl schuster a former director of operations at the us pacific command s joint intelligence center said that the indian ocean base was very important to us operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean and its loss could have a major impact forcing the us to change logistics support in the region it wouldn t weaken us military strength necessarily but logistics are everything he added diego garcia was used to guide tactical aircraft supporting us military missions in afghanistan and iraq and featured remote satellite tracking stations an air force space command and pacific air force support and logistics teams the united states has faced legal challenges to its diego garcia naval base for the past five decades the bereft chagossians took their case to british courts hoping to exert pressure to return the islands to them subsequently the attempt by the non aligned movement nam and the united nations to constitute the indian ocean as a zone of peace posed a challenge to us operations on chagos islands in 1970 the non aligned summit in lusaka zambia declared that the indian ocean must be a zone of peace from which great power rivalries and competition as well as bases must be excluded the united states attacked this idea admiral elmo zumwalt told the us congress in 1974 that the ussr stood atop the central part of the west s energy jugular down to the persian gulf for that reason the indian ocean and diego garcia has become a focal point of us foreign and economic policies and has a growing impact on our security zone of peace io coastal communities poverty and military bases like the chagossians who were forcibly displaced to mauritius and seychelles sri lankan and other indian ocean rim coastal communities tend to experience high rates of poverty debt and socio economic hardship fisheries are one of the most significant renewable resources that indian ocean countries possess to secure food supplies maintain livelihoods and assist economic growth in addition to the io s non living resources that include hydrocarbon lng and valuable minerals the icj ruling that britain needs to vacate chagos islands may shine a light and facilitate a long overdue process of de colonization of the io and enable education knowledge and technology transfer to ensure policy and legal frameworks that enable indian ocean rim countries and their often impoverished and debt trapped coastal communities to benefit from their rich marine resources both living and non living indian ocean fisheries which is worth over 3 billion according to the world wild life fund produce around a third of the world s tuna and include the valuable southern bluefin tuna sbt fishery as the io contains the spawning grounds for this species yet much of this is fished by distant water fleets from france spain eu as well as industrialized asian states such as japan korea and taiwan who sit on the indian ocean tuna commission iotc where that have been complaints that fishing quotas benefit distant water states indian ocean littoral states have been primarily engaged in near water and artisanal fishing due to lack of technology information and knowledge transfer as well as poor governance structures in the fisheries sector to up scale and industrialize fisheries and or compete with distant water fishing states that currently trawl the io deep seas where they have sometimes acquired fishery quotas of small island states zone of peace ocean grabbing and distant water fishing states chagos island s case may be seen as the tip of an ice berg in a long overdue process of decolonization of the indian ocean so that local communities may benefit from their rich ocean resources living and non living the growing global demand for natural resources has triggered a race to their exploitation and possession especially in developing countries most desired are water land forests raw materials oil gas mineral and precious stones fisheries and genetic resources emerging economies western states multinational corporations and international financial institutions have become the biggest buyers in a race that on one hand strengthens economies and creates investment opportunities and on the other threatens local communities and environmental protection marine resources in particular present opportunities and risks associated with their potential exploitation given knowledge and information asymmetries and lack of technology transfer to developing countries whose people may know relatively little about the resources found in their or the world s oceans their exploration and production pose immense technical challenges on the one hand while there is insufficient public awareness and debate about these resources and their utilization on the other oil gas minerals and methane hydrates lie in the lightless depths of the oceans and their extraction is hidden from sight even the products manufactured from them are not always obvious or tangible in our daily lives the term ocean grabbing has been used to describe actions policies or initiatives that deprive small scale fishers of resources dispossess vulnerable populations of coastal lands and or undermine historical access to areas of the sea rights and access to marine resources and spaces are frequently reallocated through government including inter governmental or private sector initiatives to achieve conservation management or development objectives with a variety of outcomes for different sectors of society sri lanka with other io rim states is richly endowed with abundant marine resources living and non living fisheries and aquaculture resources as well as yet to be exploited liquid natural gas lng possibly with oil in the mannar basin while being mineral rich in the bay of bengal including the valuable pullmodai mineral sands deposit that keeps replenishing itself under the united nation s convention on the law of the sea unclos sri lanka may claim almost 15 times more ocean area than land extent because of the peculiarities of its continental shelf for an extended exclusive economic zone eec during the negotiations leading up to adoption of unclos sri lanka established the limits of the basic maritime areas over which it would have the right to make laws and regulations and to enforce them the territorial sea 12 miles from the baseline essentially the coast over which it would have rights similar to those exercised over its land territory the contiguous zone 12 miles beyond the territorial sea in which it would have certain rights to prevent breach of its customs fiscal immigration and sanitary laws the exclusive economic zone 200 miles from the baseline in which it would have sovereign rights and jurisdiction for the purpose of exploring and exploiting natural resources both living fish seaweeds and non living minerals energy while allowing other states to exercise the freedoms given by the convention to use the area the continental shelf comprising the sea bed and sub soil of the submarine areas that extend beyond the territorial sea throughout the natural prolongation of the land territory up to the outer edge of the continental margin subject to constraints provided for in the convention up to a maximum distance of 350 miles from the baseline as the maps show sri lanka s expected territorial seas and ocean area particularly with the claimed extended eez are about 20 times more than its land mass and there are no countries in proximity south of the island almost to the south pole except maldives and chagos islands atolls assessments reveal extensive mineral assets in the eastern seas in the bay of bengal and known lng stocks with possible oil deposits in the mannar basin today we are witnessing a major process of enclosure of the world s oceans and fisheries resources including marine coastal and inland fisheries ocean grabbing is occurring mainly through policies laws and practices that are re defining and re allocating access use and control of fisheries resources away from small scale fishers and their communities and often with little concern for the adverse environmental consequences existing customary and communal fisheries tenure rights systems and use and management practices are being ignored and ultimately lost in the process ocean grabbing thus means the capturing of control by powerful economic actors of crucial decision making around fisheries including the power to decide how and for what purposes marine resources are used conserved and managed now and in the future as a result these powerful actors whose main concern is making profit are steadily gaining control of both the fisheries resources and the benefits of their use as mads barbesgaard notes increasingly under the rubric of blue growth global policy processes that purportedly align the needs of the poor with profit interests and environmental concerns are being pushed forward by burgeoning alliances of environmental ngos the private sector and international institutions these blue growth policy proposals drawing on market based mechanisms effectively open up for widespread commodification yet are being advocated as the only sustainable response to the increasingly dire straits of the ocean s health coupled with this broader process of selling nature to save it valuation efforts that also take the carbon storage and capture abilities of coastal ecosystems into account are increasingly being pushed as a crucial tool to fight the climate crisis while proponents guarantee sustainable outcomes similar market based conservation efforts on land have had huge socio ecological consequences for communities on the ground will blue growth projects have similar consequences for coastal communities blue growth conservation sans local communities and southern voices increasingly environmental discourses are also used to deny local communities access to marine resources including inter governmental negotiations on marine resources that lack consultation with southern fisheries communities again the chagos islands case is instructive in april 2010 the british foreign office said that 640 000 square kilometres of the archipelago would now be a marine reserve which should remain uninhabited the british government told the us government in a secret cable that the former inhabitants would find it difficult if not impossible to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire chagos were a marine reserve this was environmental conservation for military purposes no statement was made to remove the us base from diego garcia which would be at the heart of the marine reserve in 2015 mauritius went to the court of arbitration at the hague where they won a ruling that the british declaration of the marine reserve was illegal the uk had not consulted either mauritius or the chagossians britain eventually said that the chagossians would not be able to exercise their right to return because of the objections of the us military there is a need for southern voices particularly south asian and african voices from io rim states to inform debates on frameworks for evaluating whether marine conservation management or development may amount to ocean grabbing and proposes an agenda for future research and actionincreasingly environmental discourses are also used to limit local indian ocean communities access to marine resources including some aspects of the cites negotiations the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora also known as the washington convention on marine resources given lack of awareness and technical expertise and strong institutions among indian ocean rim states in the negotiation process a recent report by the transnational institute masifundise and afrika kontakt on ocean grabbing shows how the rise of market based fishing policies that favour large scale aqua industries is systematically dispossessing fishers of the means to livelihood the report cites examples of luxury beach resorts in sri lanka where fishermen can no longer get to the coast the destruction of mangrove areas in ecuador to promote export oriented shrimp aquaculture that has destroyed fishing habitats and the dramatic rise of rights based fishery rbf policies that have handed over large tracts of ocean to industrial fishing companies in europe canada and elsewhere the common denominator in all of these cases is the exclusion of small scale fishers from access to fisheries in nearly every case the grabs are technically legal hidden inside policy documents trade agreements conservation mandates and fishing policies what is left out of these documents is the impact of these decisions on our natural heritage and the livelihoods and food sovereignty of over half a billion people around the world who depend on small scale fishing the world bank s global partnership for oceans gpo is one such legal framework for grabbing bringing together a set of powerful actors from usaid to the walton family foundation the family behind walmart to big environmental ngos such as the world wildlife fund and the environmental defense fund gpo s goal is to spread private property rights over the ocean s fish resources its premise is that the lack of economic and environmental sustainability in fisheries around the world is due to a lack of property rights rather than an issue of equity or justice the effect of this one size fits all solution is that it strengthens powerful political actors at the expense of the majority and leads to a market for the new owners to trade away these rights as they please sri lanka s fisheries sector governance and islanded development policy the io tuna fishery industry is worth between 2 3 billion the wwf estimates although sri lanka as an island nation has extensive indian ocean marine and fisheries resources the country s fisheries sector accounts for only about 1 8 of the national gdp sri lanka has exclusive fishing and economic rights for an ocean area of 500 000 square kilometres and a coastal line of 1700 km in addition to inland water bodies which makes fishery to be one of the promising industries in the country fisheries provides direct or indirect employment for about 540 000 people 7 of the labour force the annual production of the sector is about 550 000 tonnes of fish and 85 of this comes from marine fisheries of which 60 is landed in fishing ports for decades succeeding fisheries ministers and the fisheries ministry of the government of sri lanka has found it easier to sign over sri lanka s fishing rights ironically to aid donors to the sector ironically rather than ensure the transfer of knowledge and technology to actually enable sri lankan fisheries to up scale industrialize into deep water fishing to benefit the local fisheries communities and businesses what is needed is good governance forward thinking to up scale and industrialize sri lanka s southern fisheries sector to enable sustainable deep sea fishing with a masterplan road map and achievement targets the country continues to spend valuable foreign exchange on importing fish according to the statistics of the fisheries department the quantity of fish imported from 2018 has been 84 463 metric tons a sum of 32 726 million rupees has been spent for this purpose dried fish sprats maldive fish canned fish and live fish ornamental fish have been imported such a large amount of money flowing out of the country is a serious situation recently on request of the fisher community state minister of fisheries and aquatic resources development recently decided to take steps to reduce fish imports the minister said that such a decision has to be taken with the objective of safeguarding the local fishermen and fisheries industry and it has been decided to strictly enforce the import restriction during the period from september to when fish harvest is high by empowering the fishermen to protect the local fisher folk and raise fish harvest and by providing the necessary facilities to make the maximum contribution to meet the fishery needs of the country a large amount of money can be retained within the country the state minister said despite the existence of rich bluefin tuna fisheries grounds in the indian ocean where sri lanka enjoys a prime location the island has been unable to industrialize and up scale the fisheries sector and develop it as a leading export and foreign exchange generating industry this despite arguably because of decades of international development aid projects to the fisheries sector and ministry of fisheries from the very same distant ocean countries whose fleets harvest in and off sri lanka s exclusive economic zone eez france spain japan and korea taiwan and more recently china it would appear that reliance on foreign aid and experts has contributed to under development of sri lanka s fisheries and marine resources where tuna live and how much is caught in each rfmo by metric tonne tuna is high value and an important but not a well managed fishery in the indian ocean and sri lankan eez there are claims that the indian ocean stock is currently overfished and has no proper management regulations aimed at with sustaining the stock in the indian ocean tuna catches increased rapidly from about 179 959 t in 1980 to about 832 246 t in 1995 they have continued to increase up to 2005 where the catch reached 1 318 648 t forming about 26 of the world catch however since 2006 onwards there was a decline in tuna catch and in 2010 the catch was only 1 257 908 t tuna production in india continued to increase with fluctuations from 63 633 t during 2001 2005 to an of average 78 400 t during 2006 2010 and in 2010 the catch declined again to only 65 863 t presently tuna accounts for around 42 of sri lanka s total fish catch and 49 of the marine fish catch amounting to approximately 143 000 tons but like the atlantic blue fin tuna the indian ocean tuna species yellow fin tuna kelawalla skipjack balaya and the big eye tuna once common are also facing a threat due to unsustainable fishing practices the iotc allocates a quota system among fishing nations to regulate the tuna catch in the indian ocean setting up a maximum sustainable tuna yield at the moment the maximum sustainable tuna yield is set at 350 000 tons for yellow fin tuna and 110 000 tons for big eye tuna however even the distant water fishing nations like france due to colonial ownership of small island in the indian ocean are members of the indian ocean tuna commission iotc and there are complains the quota system is favouring them indian ocean littoral states have been engaged in near water and artisanal fishing due to lack of technology information and knowledge transfer to up scale and industrialized fisheries sectors sri lankan and indian marine fish harvest is mainly around coastal waters up to 100 meters depth and about 90 per cent of the catch comes from up to 50 m while overcrowding of many existing fisheries habours with small scale vessles has been indicated there has been little attempt to up scale and industrialize fisheries sector for deep sea fishing in the southern seas of lanka which are adjacent to large tuna areas and were relatively unaffected during the 30 years of war a recent revalidation of marine fisheries potential in india indicated that the fishing pressure on the stock in near shore waters has gone up considerably and signs of over exploitation of species while northern coastal fishery faces issues like the sustainability resources conservation and management sri lanka s southern seas are richly endowed and there is ample scope of increasing production by venturing into deeper waters of the eez while the norther seas were also less fished due to the armed conflict eu france and spain sit on the indian ocean tuna commission and there are complaints that fisheries quotas favour the distant water fleets to the detriment of livelihoods of poor coastal fisheries communities and sustainable fisheries but regional fishing bodies in the indian ocean have only policy recommendation functions meaning it s up to the individual states to implement measures to manage fisheries effectively conventionon international trade in endangered speciesof wild fauna and flora the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites also known as the washington convention is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals washington with is not a signatory of unclos the may 2019 cites convention is targeting ocean and marine resources at this time and what is termed illegal unreported and un regulated iuu fisheries practices and trade in fishery more often than not by less technologically advanced fishers particularly of small island nation states the question remains would cites billed as the largest ever conference of its kind held in sri lanka be yet another attempt indeed the next generation in legalese technology and innovation to limit access to and trade in io ocean resources by less technologically advanced io rim countries and small island nation states while legitimizing indian ocean resource grabbing by distant water fishing states and colonial powers that continue to dominate the indian ocean resource extraction process local fisheries communities and organizations have not been consulted in the cites process in sri lanka the host state of the convention which this time round is targeting ocean resources whereas the priority should be 1 enabling local often impoverished io fisher communities that mainly engage is near shore and artisanal fishing to scale up and harvest their ocean resources which are currently also over exploited by distant water former colonial powers that trawl the deep seas 2 limiting if or out right banning fleets from distant water fishing states harvesting in the indian ocean and 3 reviewing if not out right overturning the current quota allocation system to enable fish stocks to recover form over fishing by large distant ocean trawlers and local indian ocean rim communities to harvest io resources cites which may herald the next generation in ocean grabbing would identify lists of endangered species the trade in which have to be highly monitored with expensive and sophisticated tracking and information technology and various trade conditionalities that would benefit and enable states that have such technology and multinational corporations given technology dominance various other proposals are on the table to make local io communities pay for dwfs over fishing in io for instance an organization called oceans 5 supports a questionable innovative project to develop a debt for nature swap that will establish large marine protected areas and a permanent trust fund for the people of the seychelles sri lanka currently in a washington consensus a debt trap and may well be compelled to do debt for nature swaps with io fisheries grounds in its eez in the context of ongoing cites conference negotiations such a scenario is unfolding with the valuable pullmodai mineral sands in the east coast of sri lanka that is earmarked for sale without value addition at this time in the context it would be important for sri lanka s foreign ministry and cites negotiators to develop an indian ocean small island nation s and rim states position in consultation with other indian ocean rim states for the cites international convention to benefit local fisheries communities and emphasize the need for 1 limiting access and or out right banning of distant water states fisheries trawlers that have over fished in the indian ocean to enable fish stocks to recover and local indian ocean fisheries communities to harvest io resources 2 there should be transfer of technology knowledge and info to small island nations to help them harvest io resources

the importance of climate related issues for financial stability and monetary policy have become increasingly clear governor stephen s poloz said in a march 27 statement this is particularly true for canada where resources play a vital role in our economy and where the natural environment is a defining feature of our national identity the central bank said it will also create a multi year research plan to study climate related financial risks and had signed on to a network of central bankers looking at greening the financial system it will also continue to green its own operations through energy and waste reduction canada s central bank said wednesday it is now building climate related risks into our financial system review process and will highlight results on its financial system hub the bank of canada is committing to investigate and be more transparent about how climate change will affect the country s economy as scientists warn of extreme weather that could disrupt global trade and damage critical infrastructure his newest statement also comes one day after an opinion piece in national observer noted that no senior official at the central canadian bank had referenced climate change in any meaningful statement for two years these issues did not appear to be on the radar of poloz in december in his annual speech about the state of the canadian economy in the speech he outlined a number of risks to the financial system including the struggling oil and gas sector and a lack of pipelines but he failed to mention the risks posed by climate change the announcement came two days after the federal reserve bank of san francisco part of the united states central banking system published a report stating that climate related financial risks could affect the economy through elevated credit spreads greater precautionary saving and in the extreme a financial crisis insurance rates climbing as planet warms the bank of canada as the institution that promotes the nation s economic and financial welfare including through setting the key interest rate influencing the money supply and managing the government s public debt programs and foreign exchange reserves can play a powerful role in canada s own shift to a low carbon economy the central bank for example produces a biannual list of economic risks in a report called the financial system review where it has warned about things like household debt the housing market imbalance and cyber threats some economists have been calling for climate related risks to be included in those reports arguing that not doing so means investors aren t getting the full picture scientists say climate change will lead to sea level rise affecting the many cities along canada s coastlines as well as trigger more wildfires droughts floods and storms putting canadians and their communities and infrastructure at greater risk it is also expected to spread disease and lead to agricultural losses and more extreme temperature fluctuations like heat waves and cold snaps the san francisco fed said those kinds of threats are expected to directly hit commodity prices and disrupt global supply chains as well as alter the economic landscape as populations adapt through building seawalls fortified buildings and climate controls like air conditioners canadian scientists have concluded that the catastrophic wildfires across british columbia in 2017 were made far worse by climate change canadian fossil fuel assets also face a risk of plummeting value as governments like canada move to tax carbon pollution as the economy adjusts to the reality of climate change insurance rates are climbing in many parts of the world the insurance bureau of canada mentioned severe weather events driven by climate change when it tied over 48 million in insured damage to a february winter storm in ontario severe weather cost almost 2 billion in insured damage nationwide last year the world s largest re insurance company munich re has also recently warned that climate change could soon make insurance premiums unaffordable for most people the guardian reported on march 21 the toronto stock exchange the largest stock exchange in the country volunteered this year for an initiative committed to environmental disclosure that means the stock exchange is now expected to engage with the companies it lists on issues like sustainable development along with its sister exchange in calgary the tsx accounts for more oil and gas firms than any other in the world a large portion of canadian retirement savings and pension funds are also connected with fossil fuel companies the international institute for sustainable development iisd has found céline bak a senior associate with the international institute for sustainable development attends a g7 energy ministers conference in halifax on sept 21 2018 file photo by alex tétreault low carbon path difficult without system change the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc says humanity must dramatically cut its burning of fossil fuels like oil natural gas and coal which pollute the atmosphere trap heat and warm the planet in order to avoid more severe climate consequences the iisd warned about a lack of transparency over the risks faced by canadian businesses from a global pollution crackdown like the paris agreement the think tank said if governments and industry wait too long to scale back pollution it could create an economic shock if an adjustment is suddenly factored in to markets céline bak the iisd senior associate who authored the report and president of consulting firm analytica advisors told national observer wednesday she was pleased to see that the bank of canada understands and wishes to recognize the the importance of climate related issues for financial stability and monetary policy the ipcc has made it clear she said in an interview that without systemic change of our financial system it will be impossible for financial flows to be compatible and to support the transition to low carbon economic pathways once canadians recognize the urgent need for the financial system to change she said there will be major investment opportunities bak said she looked forward to streamlining these efforts through prudent energy scenarios including in the upcoming report of the bank s new network the central banks and supervisors network for greening the financial system these will provide foundations for the bank or canada and canadian supervisor s action to facilitate the transition of the canadian economy and respond to the long term goals of the paris agreement she said
cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com gold prices leaped on wednesday 20th march to 1 309 an ounce up 0 19 on that day following the federal reserve s unexpected dovish stance the fomc announced its decision to keep interest rates unchanged between 2 25 and 2 50 and no further rate hikes for 2019 versus the initially prognosed two rate hikes it also announced that it will end its balance sheet runoff in september this year this decision led to the us dollar plunging over night against its rival currencies and the eur usd surging to a six week high monetary policy and the direction of the us dollar have been a key trend to watch out for in 2019 to determine the direction of gold performance but why is this so important a short historical analysis historically gold performance has increased when the fed shifted from a tightening to a more neutral stance this effect may not always have been immediate but it has been apparent and the current cycle is similar to the last two cycles 1999 2000 and 2004 2007 suggesting an upward trend in gold prices is possible in the near future continuous rising gold prices over at least a 12 month period as witnessed in both cycles a flat or inverted yield curve as was apparent in both cycles falling retail sales which also occurred during both cycles worsening credit conditions as happened during the 2006 2007 cycle unusual extensions of risk assets valuations during 2000 peaking oil price during 2000 basis the above there is a tendency towards increased gold performance during a post tightening cycle in 2001 it took 12 months for the gold price to rise 3 6 12 months after the fed stopped raising rates on the hand in 2007 it took only one month for the gold price to rise by 7 and 19 a year later in 2008 gold significantly outperformed all other major stock markets the average annual performance of gold from 2001 to 2019 has been 9 1 today though there is an eventual visible strong gold performance it is not only the outcome of the focm that has an impact on this nor is this the only reason one should consider to add gold to their portfolio at this moment in time gold is and remains a safe haven asset providing a source of return diversification and liquidity to one s wealth especially during times signaling a potential pre recession phase demand and prices may therefore increase further on the basis of the following global financial markets risks the trailing road to current recovery which may be a sign of economic exhaustion the flatting and inverting of

will not however come at the expense of quality diligence and prudence in the projects we choose to support to this extent we will continue to focus on projects which produce premium materials which we believe will continue to command a higher premium over time in addition to product quality we will also maintain a strict focus on how the projects are operated and managed from an esg perspective and we will only support those projects which are being run ethically and responsibly our annual report contains further information in relation to our initiatives in this area during 2018 and how we see this evolving in the years ahead although anglo pacific is not an operator our investments are in natural resources projects and we continue to believe in the ongoing need for high quality low polluting products which are operated in a responsible manner by experienced management teams the backdrop for raising capital for natural resources companies continues to be challenging given the scarcity of capital in the sector however we feel confident that we can continue to make investments and grow our portfolio in a meaningful way in 2019 with the owners of kestrel targeting a 40 increase in volume in 2019 along with having access to 78m us 100m of liquidity on our balance sheet for making additional quality investments we are in a very strong position from which to grow in the year ahead 1 adjusted earnings loss represents the group s underlying operating performance from core activities adjusted earnings loss is the profit loss attributable to equity holders less all valuation movements non cash impairments and amortisation charges which are non cash ifrs adjustments that arise primarily due to changes in commodity prices finance costs any associated deferred tax and any profit or loss on non core asset disposals as these are not expected to be ongoing 2 free cash flow is the net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents prior to core acquisitions equity raising and changes in the level of borrowings outlook anglo pacific made significant progress in 2018 which lays the foundations to fund further growth in 2019 we have a firm expectation to generate organic growth from the company s royalty portfolio which should subject to prevailing commodity prices result in strong earnings and cash generation we continue to see traditional capital finance for new mining projects remaining constrained in current markets and whilst this presents challenges for small to medium sized miners this conversely presents increasing opportunities and demand for royalties this should provide anglo pacific with opportunities to add attractive assets to its portfolio growth and delivering value remain a focus for the company in 2019 and the years following

natural resources royalty and streaming company the company s strategy is to develop a leading international diversified royalty and streaming company with a portfolio centred on base metals and bulk materials focusing on accelerating income growth through acquiring royalties on projects that are currently cash flow generating or are expected to be within the next 24 months as well as investment

operators of the properties underlying its portfolio of royalties and investments as available at the date of this announcement this announcement contains information and statement relating to the kestrel mine that are based on certain estimates and forecasts that have been provided to the group by kestrel coal pty ltd kcpl the accuracy of which kcpl does not warrant and on which readers may not rely chairman s statement 2018 has been another strong year for anglo pacific with record revenue flowing through to earnings and cash flow we expect 2019 to be an even stronger year for the group certainly in terms of volume growth following the new owner of kestrel announcing plans to increase production by 40 in 2019 taking the above into account we have recommended a 14 increase in the dividend to 8p per share for the year we enter 2019 in a very strong financial position with a renewed focus on growing our royalty portfolio and remain confident that our offering will continue to be appealing in what remains a very capital constrained sector it is perhaps timely to reflect on the mining industry which is the focus of our investments the recent tragic and fatal collapse of a tailings dam in brazil is a stark reminder of the complex and challenging nature of mining and the need for the highest standards in respect of safety and the environment the scale of the incident will rightly result in enhanced scrutiny on operators from regulatory bodies governments ngos lenders and investors in relation to safety and the use of best practice techniques particularly when operating in close proximity to communities such issues are a top priority for anglo pacific when undertaking due diligence we take comfort from our track record thus far in the environmental social and governance esg credentials of the operators we have supported we will continue to do our utmost to be a force for positive action as we make investment decisions and work with the operators of the assets in our portfolio it is easy to forget the substantial positive contribution made by mining to society as a whole the metals and minerals extracted are essential for our everyday existence in the developed world and also help the developing world advance and lift people out of poverty as an industry mining needs to do a better job at educating on and communicating the benefits of the extractive sector as an investor and believer in the sector we will do our part as best we can performance in 2018 the group saw its total portfolio contribution increase by 16 to 49 4m buoyed by resilient commodity prices and a strong contribution from our most recent acquisitions the company executed 39 3m of royalty acquisitions in 2018 which added 2m to income in the second half the acquisitions were financed organically by drawing on the group s borrowing facility with the group returning to a net cash position post year end in addition we took the opportunity to upsize and extend our borrowing facility on more favourable pricing terms which now when combined with existing cash resources provides for 78m us 100m of liquidity to finance further growth opportunities the higher commodity prices and revenues during the year translated directly into higher profits and cash generation operating profit increased to 37 1m from 30 6m in 2017 basic earnings per share were 15 97p compared with 5 88p in 2017 stripping out non cash items we present an adjusted earnings measure which we believe more closely reflects the performance within management s control on this basis adjusted earnings per share were 18 02p 2017 16 82p dividends in light of the continued growth in our income strong dividend cover and the prospect for further growth in 2019 we have recommended a 25 increase in the final dividend to 3 125p which if approved by shareholders at the 2019 agm would result in total dividends for 2018 of 8p per share a 14 increase on the 7p paid in 2017 we feel that this level of dividend rewards the continued support of our shareholders whilst allowing us to employ cash in growth opportunities as we operate in a cyclical and often volatile sector we have kept the quarterly dividend level of 1 625p unchanged and we will assess the total dividend level for 2019 when we announce our q4 2019 trading update this implies dividend cover of around 2 5x which is approximately the level we are targeting for 2019 our intention is to continue to reinvest the bulk of our retained income in growth at this favourable stage of the cycle corporate culture and governance anglo pacific seeks to maintain the highest standards in all areas of its business i believe this starts at the top and the board sees it as a key part of its responsibility to set the right guidelines for the group to operate to the highest ethical standards we hold an annual strategy day and in 2018 included sessions on strategy esg risk and board effectiveness we work with industry experts where appropriate who bring an objective and impartial insight to how the group approaches these areas while we acknowledge that we are not directly responsible for the operation of the underlying assets in our portfolio we are committed to making the pursuit of best practice in esg a high priority board we were pleased to announce the appointment of vanessa dennett to our board in november following an extensive search process vanessa brings with her a wealth of transaction experience in the mining industry having held senior roles within anglo american plc her commercial experience in negotiating and structuring transactions investment process and corporate governance complements the finance and operational expertise of the board vanessa has already made positive contributions to the board and has proved a very helpful sounding board to our executive team and we look forward to her continued participation in the coming years the directors possess different skills and i believe operate effectively in bringing a diversity of approach and experience to the overall activities of the board and committees in determining strategy and providing guidance and oversight to management as the group develops we will continue to evaluate the composition of the board and refresh when appropriate market background against a background of increasing signs of a global slowdown concerns surrounding china s debt burden and the us china trade war along with rising us treasury yields it was perhaps not surprising to see equity values fall at the end of 2018 although we believe that small and mid cap mining companies were underrated before this bearish sentiment it suggests that the availability of capital to finance new mining projects will become even more scarce and the cost of borrowing will increase accordingly this should provide anglo pacific with opportunities to add attractive assets to its portfolio especially as we in turn are not necessarily dependent on the equity markets to raise capital to finance such opportunities given our access to liquidity and the prospect for significant organic growth in 2019 outlook we expect 2019 to produce healthy organic growth from our royalty portfolio this should subject to prevailing commodity prices result in another strong year of earnings and cash generation we believe there will be continued demand for royalty and alternative financing in the mining sector in 2019 given the shortage of and rising cost of capital facing the sector anglo pacific is firmly focused on growth and has the balance sheet strength to continue to add to our portfolio of royalties 2019 should be a busy year and i have no doubt that the dedicated hardworking and experienced team led by julian treger is well placed to deliver our growth targets i would like to thank the board the executive team and staff for their continued diligence and hard work on behalf of the board n p h meier chairman 26 march 2019 chief executive officer s statement anglo pacific continued to deliver on its strategy in 2018 our portfolio generated a record contribution of 49 4m representing a 16 increase on 2017 this is very pleasing especially as the consensus at the beginning of the year was forecasting a decline i would like to highlight that maracás menchen the vanadium royalty which we acquired in 2014 is now our second largest royalty by revenue having generated 5 9m in royalties during 2018 compared to 2 0m in 2017 we expect further organic growth to come in 2019 driven by plans for a 40 increase in volumes from kestrel along with a full year of revenue from our investment in liorc the accelerated volumes expected from kestrel should have a positive impact on free cash flow but will also bring forward the point at which mining will leave the group s private royalty land as such the imperative is now firmly on reinvesting this cash flow to replace kestrel s income in the medium term and this is our firm focus for the year ahead track record and experienced team we have demonstrated our ability to successfully identify accretive royalty related assets over the past five years having acquired royalties over the narrabri and maracás mines together with an indirect interest in the royalty over the iron ore company of canada ioc mines through our investment in liorc in addition we have gained exposure to the cigar lake operation through a toll milling agreement we have also added some longer term growth opportunities to the portfolio through our investment in the piauí and cañariaco royalties the investment of 130m into the group s portfolio over the past five years could subject to commodity prices generate a sustainable 15m of annual revenue before development upside this is a good start but we feel now is the time to accelerate our rate of growth and are in a strong financial position to do so with 78m us 100m of liquidity available to us the success of these investments has been achieved through the application of our investment criteria which aims to ensure that our new royalties are over projects which should continue to operate throughout the cycle more recently we have also targeted high quality lower polluting products in the belief that these should command more of a premium over time it is gratifying to see this belief realised from the returns on our investments in liorc iron ore pellet narrabri low ash high energy thermal coal and maracás menchen vanadium executing the group s strategy and applying our investment criteria is our very experienced senior management team which has remained largely unchanged over the past five years and whose skill set covers all of our key diligence areas namely geology corporate finance structuring and tax the skills of the management team are augmented by those of our board who bring a variety of further operational m a corporate finance and corporate governance experience to the group the combined breadth and depth of the senior management team and board s knowledge and experience has allowed the group to assess a wide range of potential transactions across multiple jurisdictions and commodities given our growth ambitions we are allocating more resources to our investment team in order to develop our pipeline and execute on deals in the year ahead our people are our key assets and staff related expenses make up 64 of the group s total cost base we operate in a very scalable business and it is interesting to note that our costs are virtually identical to those in 2014 even though our income has increased by 12 5 times over that period liorc investment the highlight of our acquisition strategy in 2018 was the purchase of our 4 29 stake in labrador iron ore royalty corporation liorc a publicly quoted royalty pass through vehicle listed in toronto we increased our exposure to iron ore as we believe the industry dynamics have improved well beyond the general market perception and prices will be stronger for longer further liorc is focused at the high quality end of the iron ore market and enjoys a favourable premium for its product we also expected liorc to produce yields of around ten percent which is very respectable for a mine in a premier jurisdiction operated by rio tinto we are pleased to report that in 2018 the income we received from liorc exceeded our initial expectations and that the current market value of the investment is significantly above our cost environmental social and governance although anglo pacific is not an operator our role as a financier and supporter of the mining sector has put us in a position to appraise hundreds of royalty transactions each year and allowed us to see the full spectrum of esg practices within the industry we have seen the mining industry be at the fore front of technological innovation through developments such as driverless trucks and trains it has produced the commodities necessary to manufacture many products and gadgets today considered to be indispensable together with providing the energy required to power the modern world many mining operations also uplift the communities in which they are located by providing employment infrastructure long term development opportunities and increased prosperity the industry must communicate these benefits more effectively and investment into the sector must be encouraged in order to provide those minerals and commodities which will continue to be needed projects and operations involving higher quality cleaner products which are operated to the highest possible standards of environmental and social responsibility are likely to attract capital in the first instance and it is these projects which anglo pacific has looked to support in the recent past there is no doubt that the world will transition to more sustainable forms of energy generation but in the short to medium term a quicker solution to a cleaner world is the use of higher quality lower polluting commodities be it their chemical properties or the way in which they are extracted operated and rehabilitated given our exposure to such a diverse range of projects and our track record of investing in those which would clearly fit in with the above criteria we see a role for anglo pacific in being a conduit for investors who might otherwise not have a mandate to invest in the underlying mining projects directly this is an initiative which we hope to be thought leaders in and explore in further detail in 2019 we will of course continue to hold ourselves accountable to such standards in our own investment activity kestrel the change in ownership of kestrel during the year was a significant event for anglo pacific as it remains our dominant source of revenue a consortium of emr capital a well known mining financier based in australia and adaro energy a leading indonesian producer of coal with over 26 years of experience in operating coal mines completed their acquisition of the operation in q3 2018 the price which the consortium paid us 2 25bn was 50 higher than some commentators had been predicting this signalled that the new owners would be keen to significantly increase production in the short term indeed adaro suggested that they could over a period of time double production at kestrel having taken over operational control during q3 2018 the new owners have begun work on their expansion plans they have now stated that they are forecasting a 40 uplift in production volumes for 2019 which is far in excess of the levels which were previously achieved by rio tinto this would be quite timely for anglo pacific as it coincides with a period in which virtually all mining will be taking place within the group s private royalty land suggesting that there could be a material uplift in royalty income commencing in 2019 subject to commodity prices remaining stable we have actively engaged with kestrel s new operations team to better understand their plans for expanding production and have undertaken a site visit to see for ourselves how they plan to achieve this and although this seems on paper to be a stretch target it is encouraging to see that the operating team are motivated to achieve this we have also met with representatives from adaro in indonesia and look forward to a constructive and cordial working relationship with them going forward with the anticipated increase in production and our continued belief that the market for cleaner coal such as that produced at kestrel will remain strong for the foreseeable future it is clear that kestrel will remain the group s largest source of royalty income it is worth noting however that over the past five years according to analysts who follow our company the proportion of our net asset value nav attributed to kestrel has fallen from 72 to 48 demonstrating our success in diversifying our asset base year by year and reducing our reliance on kestrel market background given our track record to date we are confident that we can deliver on our growth ambitions the mining sector continues to suffer from a scarcity of capital particularly in the small to mid cap segment which is an area where we have seen a lot of deal flow in the past conventional bank debt remains hard to come by for junior developers and us dollar denominated debt has become more expensive following a series of increases in the us bank rate imposed by the fed during 2018 as part of their reduction in quantitative easing rising us interest rates have also impacted on the equity markets as the us 10 year treasury yield increased noticeably during 2018 and exceeded us inflation for the first time since the financial crisis with the risk free rate increasing the premium required to invest elsewhere has also risen resulting in the price of equities coming under pressure as the rate of return on safe haven investments rose the equity markets have also experienced a fundamental change over the past few years with the growth of index funds leading to capital allocation being concentrated toward the largest companies in the past we would have seen mining funds raise significant amounts of capital to invest in the sector these funds had the expertise discipline patience and understanding needed to select and support new mining projects the popularity of indexation is one factor which has caused this to change with capital flowing to index funds which by their nature tend to be passive and liquidity driven often following algorithms rather than using industry expertise to evaluate and back investment decisions for mining this has meant that any capital in the sector is predominantly being invested in the likes of rio tinto or bhp this would not ordinarily be a problem if the majors were using this capital to invest in growth which in the past would have led to investments and m a at the junior end of the market however the majors now appear to be ex growth scarred by their acquisition sprees towards the end of the last decade as such equity capital flowing into the majors is now being distributed back to their shareholders through special dividends and share buy backs which means in many instances capital is ultimately leaving the sector given the scarcity of conventional debt and equity and with mezzanine private equity financing solutions often being prohibitively expensive or dilutive we would expect to see the demand for royalty financing to remain robust in the near term and our pipeline reflects this with a strong balance sheet significant free cash flow generation and access to some 78m us 100m of liquidity we are now in a position whereby we can act quickly and opportunistically should circumstances demand outlook 2019 will be an interesting year for the global economy with the threat of a slowdown in gdp growth in the us and potential recession in parts of europe the sustainability of chinese growth given its debt levels and of course the ongoing uncertainty in relation to brexit despite the uncertainty facing the global economy the outlook for the year ahead is positive for anglo pacific we reported record income in 2018 and absent significant volatility in commodity prices we expect 2019 to show further organic growth from the portfolio with our dividend well covered we expect to generate significant cash flow over the course of the year and with ample liquidity available we are in a strong financial position to add to the

update the euro to us dollar exchange rate fell to a fresh two week low in early thursday trading with the cross coming under pressure following a below forecast spanish cpi release it s a release heavy session with eurozone cpi releases due while over in the us the latest gross domestic product gbp growth figures are expected alongside a number of speeches from federal open market committee fomc members joining nordea analysts danske bank researchers anticipate upside for the fibre to be capped with the risk of near term dollar strength posing a route to further potential downside in the short term further out danske analysts wrote for eur a key question is if ecb will shift its rhetoric to whether rather than when a first hike is warranted the bar for ecb to do more is clearly lower after the march meeting but it remains high due to a constrained toolbox and a new president in the autumn they added on a 3m horizon we see eur usd trapped in a range around 1 13 but with risks tilted to the downside as ecb will be forced to keep a soft stance at a time where fed looks more side lined with caution the order of the hour amid prominent growth risks both the us federal reserve and the european central bank have adopted a dovish stance with virtually nil expectations for rate hikes on the horizon in fact markets pricing suggests the next adjustment to rates could be lower the latest foreign exchange rate forecasts from nordea bank danmark nordea suggest that the euro us dollar eur usd exchange rate could be in for some upside however stuck between a dovish fed and dovish ecb expectations of single currency gains have pared federal reserve cut dot plot projections remain in wait and see mode last week s federal open market committee fomc meeting yielded a clear message from the federal reserve that rate hikes were off the table for the foreseeable following december s dot plot projection of ir calling for two 2019 quarter point hikes and a third in 2020 the march meeting saw policymakers scale back their expectations with no ir hikes now anticipated in 2019 nordea analysts commented on the downwardly revised ir projections the fed stated slowing growth as a main reason for the change of view but we believe the change had as much to do with the scare from sharply tighter financial conditions towards the end of last year advertisement despite market pricing nordea analysts feel rate cuts to be unwarranted should current fiscal conditions persist they wrote the economic outlook remains decent core inflation is still close to target and financial conditions have eased considerably this year no fomc member has put her his dot in cut territory it will take weaker numbers before the fed starts discussing rate cuts openly however fears are rising that the world s largest economy could fall into recession in the medium term with analysts citing an inversion of the yield curve as indicative of recessive period on the horizon analysts from both nordea and ing feel the market outlook to be overly pessimistic however they did acknowledge that market perceptions could create a positive feedback loop as philadelphia fed president harker said if markets believe yield curve inversion is a recession indicator it is ing s chief international economist james knightley wrote the us bond market is seemingly worried about a slowdown while not our base case a prolonged inversion of the yield curve runs the risk of becoming a self fulfilling prophecy through constraining credit despite the downside risks facing the us economy nordea analysts feel a trigger would be needed to push the us into recession with no such trigger immediately identifiable nevertheless the one 2020 rate hike still in the fed dot plot is also questionable from nordea analysts perspectives with a development of stronger key figures and not least much easier financial conditions over coming months required to justify a further hike leading analysts to predict a 50 50 split on whether the next move is a cut or hike above nordea us interest rates forecast ecb alert to developing growth winds and armed with tltros forward guidance meanwhile on the other side of the atlantic the european central bank s latest monetary policy meeting saw policymakers take the prospect of a 2019 hike off the table replacing the guidance that rates would remain on hold until through summer 2019 to rates would remain unchanged through to the year end the ecb have been proactive in their efforts to sustain the bloc s economy however some feel the targeted long term refinancing operations wont be enough to stem the eurozone s economic slide nordea analysts wrote the ecb tried to address the quickly weakened economic outlook with strengthened forward guidance and a new a new round of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros in march based on what we know so far we do not find the terms of the new tltros particularly attractive and think the new operations will only act as a brake to the fall in excess liquidity not prevent it recent economic data from the bloc has done little to alleviate concerns over a contraction in activity with the latest round of purchasing managers index pmi releases putting the ecb s already downgraded growth forecasts into question above eurozone purchasing managers indexes pmi following ecb president mario draghi s speech earlier in the session in which he reaffirmed that monetary policy would remain accommodative and the central bank alert to and ready to respond to developing risks nordea analysts expect the central bank to take further steps to support economic growth the primary means for the ecb to tackle a weaker outlook are making the terms of the tltros more attractive primarily via a sweetener regarding the lending rate and adjusting its forward guidance even further e g until the end of march 2020 or even until summer 2020 wrote nordea analysts in terms of rates nordea analysts have pushed out their expectations with a hike anticipated in june 2020 although the analysts conceded that the call is reliant on our expectation that the euro area growth will see a rebound in the second half of the year adding that if such a rebound does not materialize or will be delayed the ecb may not raise rates in 2020 either euro us dollar exchange rate upside capped given the outlook for central bank policy nordea analysts anticipate the euro to dollar exchange rate to find limited support in the forthcoming months they wrote eur usd remains rather rangebound currently stuck between a dovish fed and a dovish ecb our liquidity models though suggest a decent chance that the next move could be higher in eur usd even though only to levels around 1 1650 adding it is currently tough to make a strong case for much higher eur usd even despite ppp models suggesting a fair value for eur usd around 1 20 in the longer run lloyds banking analysts also recently scaled back their

cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision

2019 bloomberg finance lp in a 2008 speech then federal reserve vice chairman donald kohn informed his audience that a model in the phillips curve tradition remains at the core of how most academic researchers and policymakers including this one think about fluctuations in inflation translated the entity the fed that employs more economists than any other in the world is staffed near unanimously by economists who think too many people working and producing is the cause of inflation implicit in their near monolithic view whereby they wholly redefine the nature of inflation is that during periods of growth demand outruns supply on the way to rising prices worried about the latter then fed chairman ben bernanke spoke in 2007 of an alleged downside to global economic liberalization given his view that there seems to be little basis for concluding that globalization overall has significantly reduced inflation too many newly acquisitive chinese workers would drive up the cost of everything the problem is that there s no basis for what is a consensus view inside the world s foremost central bank pointing out a basic economic truth that doesn t factor into the models of most economists demand is an effect of supply as in surging global demand is logically a consequence of surging global supply this is true domestically and also internationally no one can demand without supplying first which means any price level would not be driven upward by increased demand after that the phillips curve model that informs the thinking of fed economists presumes that the u s is an impregnable economic island as opposed to a highly advanced part of a global whole translated millions of hands and robot arms around the world produce the iphone the ford f 150 and the clothes we wear the phillips curve model presumes surging domestic labor costs born of labor shortages during growth periods yet the u s economy is a booming result of global supplies of labor the above applies to capacity too the fed s economists have their output gaps and capacity utilization models and they claim too much prosperity will lead to capacity shortages such that prices rise except that the u s economy booms precisely because millions of hands and tens of thousands of factories well outside the u s are yet again integral parts of the u s production process don t readers remember how frothing protectionist lou dobbs built a second career based on u s companies aggressively accessing global labor and capacity to produce goods and services most important of all the fed s demand side growth causes inflation models presume that what we buy powers progress as opposed to investment they re confused we all have infinite demands but they re limited by our ability to supply we re able to produce more and more meaning supply thanks to investment that makes us more and more productive this requires prominent mention because the instigator of economic growth investment is what mitigates any presumed labor shortages anyone who doubts this need only consider how often they deal with living humans when buying gasoline movie tickets airline tickets not to mention the myriad things produced globally that they buy online nowadays they re at least delivered to us by humans but those days are surely numbered all thanks to investment in short the very growth that fed economists think causes labor and capacity induced inflation is the surest sign that market driven production enhancements are erasing any presumed shortages through automation all the while pushing prices down economic growth is the enemy of rising prices not an author of them the fed s models are flamboyantly backwards what s been written so far partially explains why i m so thrilled that my friend steve moore has been nominated as fed governor precisely because he doesn t buy into discredited phillips curve based views held by most inside the fed he ll bring contrarian views to an organization desperately in need of outside thinking i say this despite my own view that the fed is hurtling toward irrelevance and that its relevance has long been overstated by the various economic religions ascribing to it magical powers to either boost or shrink economic growth through what is logically impossible easy or tight money that i think the fed a legend in its own mind along with all too many economists pundits and politicians speaks to an obvious disagreement with moore about the central bank that he ll hopefully soon be a part of moore views the fed s rate machinations as important while i think they re much ado about nothing lest anyone forget no one borrows money they borrow what money can be exchanged for tangible items like computers and office space intangible services like consulting and communications and most important of all human resources crucial here is that the fed cannot increase what individuals are borrowing money to attain nor can it shrink it the goods services and human resources that economic actors aim to acquire in the real economy are always on offer in the marketplace the fed can t render the cost of real resources artificially expensive any more than it could decree the cost of those same resources cheap to believe it could is to believe that artificial price controls of the rent control variety result in abundance crucial here is that moore knows this notwithstanding his recent critiques of the fed he knows that while the fed s calcified economists believe they re altering economic reality that they can somehow decree credit cheap in the real economy it s as though the fed doesn t exist figure that bill gates can borrow easily so can apple but there s probably no interest rate at which sears could attain abundant credit right now nor could most college grads walk out of a bank with money after asking for a loan to fund their start up idea credit is plentiful in palo alto but rather scarce in neighboring east palo alto where difficult economic conditions are the norm this is all a long way of saying that the fed cannot instigate through its rate machinations at best it can confirm existing market realities as moore s mentor in arthur laffer has long said the fed is not a rate setter it is instead a rate follower all of this fits in well with a classical model that yet again says demand is enabled by supply only those supplying copious resources or those deemed by the marketplace as capable of supplying copious goods and services in the future are capable of attaining credit in the real economy for anyone to pretend that the fed can run roughshod over say s law through interest rate meddling or so called money supply management improperly presumes that the fed can bend the laws of economics it can t it should be stressed once again that the perception of the fed s oversold relevance will soon enough catch up to reality how this applies to moore is that i ll write opinion piece after opinion piece while he s in the fed s employ with an eye on convincing him that the monetary mystics buzzing around him inside and outside the central bank individuals who believe the fed can engineer prosperity through rate fiddling and management of so called money supply are giving him bad advice sorry but to presume to plan money supply is to presume to plan production there s never a problem of money supply in beverly hills greenwich or manhattan yet it s nearly always scarce in east st louis liberty city and west baltimore as a supply sider moore intuitively understands the latter supply is what enables demand which means the money exchangeable for goods and services is always and everywhere an effect of production first money necessary to facilitate exchange finds producers always this would be true with or without a fed and with or without a u s treasury or u s mint money wasn t first created by the state rather it was created by producers who needed an agreement about value that would enable producers of varying goods and services and varying wants to trade with one another it s all a reminder that the fed couldn t increase money supply in buffalo any more than it could shrink it on the upper east side in the real economy there are no money shortages where there s production about this moore and i disagree as do we disagree that the fed s vain attempts to hike interest rates all four of those attempts in 2018 having been reversed by market forces had some kind of material economic and stock market impact the easy to discredit notion that the fed can engineer economic and market bliss desperation see qe and other monetary engineering brought to you by central banks has you didn t build that qualities that free thinkers shouldn t be associating themselves with sorry but amazon s greatness and its valuation was not facilitated by a central bank projecting its vastly overstated influence through an antiquated banking system just as john d rockefeller soared to brilliant heights sans a central bank so would jeff bezos have i ll aim to convince moore of this through voluminous op eds indeed i hope he ultimately brings immense skepticism about the fed s ability to achieve anything inside its walls where moore and i agree is that money isn t an instigator as much as money quite simply is money is once again an agreement about value that facilitates the investment production and exchange without which there is no economic progress that s why money has for thousands of years been created with stability of the unit of account in mind it s not money if it s not stable simply because stability of the measure is money s sole purpose as a facilitator of trade and investment so while it s decidedly not part of the fed s portfolio to set the dollar s exchangeable value either in terms of a commodity a basket of commodities or foreign currencies it s exciting to think the economists at the fed who are wedded to floating chaotic money will have to endure a different point of view to economists whose jobs are an effect of real productivity taking place well away from their cushy world of academic delusion floating money is a good thing they plainly misunderstand how problematic it is for real producers floating money is a huge barrier to progress precisely because it slows the trade that is a prerequisite for the latter economists seem to have forgotten that no one exchanges money rather they exchange products money just enables the exchange but when its value is a moving target winners and losers are artificially created where there used to only be winners is it any wonder that global trade disputes have surged since president nixon s fateful 1971 decision cheered on by economists to sever the dollar s link to gold thus setting all global currencies afloat worse is what money without anchor means for investment economists don t have to worry about this particularly the demand side economists at the fed mainly because their hopeless models are based on consumption but in the real world consumption yet again follows supply and supply is driven by investment that constantly pushes up the productivity of workers yet when currencies are floating investment naturally lags as the uncertainty about returns necessarily slows investment translated investors who are always and everywhere buying future currency streams don t want to risk returns coming back in devalued dollars all of this explains moore s desire for money that holds its value throughout time so while he ll have the mystics buzzing around him claiming they know the proper interest rate and proper supply of dollars to achieve a stable currency hopefully he ll instruct them that the dollar s exchange value isn t part of the fed s portfolio as is all the while reminding them that the dollar merely lacks a price rule the good news is that treasury could institute a price rule between breakfast and lunch and markets would quickly adjust to it for believing in money that is money and for lacking a phd moore will suffer vicious attacks from the credentialed he already is he should know that his many friends will back him as for the economists who ve pulled out the longest of knives or who plan to never forget the profession you re part of most of you believe that the job of central banks is to put people out of work in order to keep inflationary pressures down you believe economic growth causes inflation even though it s quite literally the greatest foe of rising prices precisely because investment is what drives down the price of most everything to use but one of countless examples that support the previous truth the fastest computer in the world today is three times as powerful and four times cheaper than the 2nd fastest computer built three years ago feverish growth enhancing investment continues to result in faster more capable technology that is also quite a bit less expensive your same profession believes that government spending actually powers economic revival implicit there is that during slowdowns the economy gains when nancy pelosi mitch mcconnell and donald trump are arrogating to themselves enhanced control over resource allocation relative to jeff bezos michael dell and peter thiel your pathetic theories are rooted in the view that central planning actually works and that collectivism failed flamboyantly in the 20th century solely because the murderous governments that tried it lacked your allegedly wise minds but most damning of all is the criminally obtuse yet largely monolithic view inside your profession that world war ii ended the great depression to believe a profession that compares unfavorably to astrology and that is spectacularly wrong much more often the maiming and killing of the people who power all economic advance has a growth upside thinking about all this thank goodness moore isn t one of you your profession has meant less than nothing for progress throughout history figure that the best books smith s wealth of nations hazlitt s economics in one lesson ricardo s principles of political economy and taxation say s treatise on political economy and mill s principles of political economy were written by non economists as is while the individuals who comprise the global economy never needed credential people of your ilk to prosper it s useful to point out that your cushy jobs that enable you to think 365 days year are a certain consequence of economic growth that your models in no way enabled rather than looking down on moore maybe learn something from him and not just about economics watch as moore acts decently in the face of cruel verbal assaults on him happy warrior that he is moore will smile despite the unsmiling things said here s hoping steve moore is confirmed as the next federal reserve governor economists captivated by what s easily disprovable and that can be murderous arguably have the most to gain from someone they so outwardly disdain so will those who simply want to understand how to be a good person

cashing in on charter schools part five advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that new jersey charter schools acquire and finance buildings a shortsighted law a lack of funding and inadequate oversight have left new jersey s charter schools to find their own way when it comes to filling a basic need finding a home the result is a system that allows charter school operators to use public money to pay for buildings that are privately owned it can push charter schools and the support groups that own and finance real estate on their behalf into unusual and costly building deals leaving taxpayers to pick up the tab it s a system in which financial transactions often play out behind a wall of secrecy away from the public eye and beyond the reach of open records laws more than 20 years after the first charter schools opened in new jersey many still struggle with finding and funding a facility for their students and experts say change is long overdue bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing said the absence of a clear path for charter schools to obtain funding for buildings has left the door open for this to go haywire and get kind of creative and out of control over time now s the time to rein it in he said clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient in many cases private companies are created to own the real estate and the rent they collect from charter schools money that comes from taxpayers is used to repay the debt on the buildings hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid is going to some of the largest charter operators to construct or renovate buildings that are used by charter schools but are privately owned in interviews and emails advocates and critics offered an array of ideas for improving the way that charter schools acquire and finance buildings including loosening restrictions on spending and increasing public funding and transparency bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing now s the time to rein it in clearly it has gotten out of hand we ve got these transactions which are anything but transparent and anything but efficient quote icon their suggestions include providing funding for charter schools that is earmarked for facilities closing the funding gap between traditional districts and charters removing a provision in the state s charter school law that bars charters from using state and local money to construct new buildings ensuring that publicly funded charter school buildings are owned by the public at least once the debt on the building is repaid improving coordination between charter and traditional public schools on facilities and requiring that surplus or underused space in district schools be offered to charter schools first creating an authority that would issue bonds to finance publicly owned facilities for both charter schools and traditional districts requiring state officials to review lease and finance agreements before they are signed improving oversight of charter school building projects looking into whether the state should provide direct loans or loan guarantees to charter schools requiring private companies that are created to support charter schools in real estate transactions to be transparent and to open their books to show how they are spending public money this is public money and this is a major issue said preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent it s not an easy fix public policy in this area has been lacking for two decades the administration of gov phil murphy is only now reviewing the law something that was required to be done within five years of its passage preston green a professor of education leadership and law at the university of connecticut this is public money and this is a major issue there has to be some type of examination and i don t think that the argument that there s a private entity should prevent that money from being analyzed to see how it s being spent quote icon and there are plenty of complications charter schools are publicly funded but operate independently of local school districts they have their own boards and make their own decisions supporters of charter schools say they provide opportunities for choice and innovation and should be better supported noting that more than 35 000 students are on waiting lists for seats statewide there are many who believe more autonomy and flexibility and less regulation is in keeping with the core principles of running a charter school yet there is tension between charter schools and regular public districts critics say charters undermine public education by draining cash and pupils from traditional public schools ensuring resistance from teachers unions and districts on any proposed funding hikes for charters or requirements for shared space the state education department meanwhile has limited ability to oversee charter schools its charter school office has a staff of five and has had high turnover in its leadership there have been six directors in the last decade since the private companies created by charter operators do not have to show their records it s unclear how they would react to a requirement to share information and how it would be enforced a lack of transparency even though charter schools ultimately supply the money that pays for building projects in many cases they do not possess documents related to the financing and construction of their facilities while a few charter schools were able to provide information from a support group others including the state s largest team academy and north star academy said they had no information about the debt on the buildings they use debt that is covered by the rents the schools pay to their private partners in a few instances members of charter school boards said they had been unable to get information about real estate owned by their own support groups dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield said she hit a dead end when she tried to research costs on a building owned by the school s support group and never got answers from the company that managed the school i was never privy to the original note armstrong said of the financing what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information team academy charter school in newark which is run by kipp new jersey provided this response when asked about the debt on buildings it rents from support groups your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school dawn armstrong a former president of the now defunct central jersey arts charter school in plainfield i was never privy to the original note what is this payment doing covering us 100 percent is this interest only a partial payment is there anything held at the back end i never could get that information quote icon newark s north star academy operated by uncommon schools responded similarly since the school is not a party to the loan documents we do not have records responsive to the debt service portion of this request officials said the marion p thomas charter school also in newark said it didn t have records related to one of its support groups that holds real estate a group that an official there said has an office in one of its school buildings private groups tied to charter schools many of them created solely to hold real estate also declined to provide records related to projects and their financing saying they are not subject to public records laws in many cases both the schools and their support groups declined to discuss details of financial transactions related to construction projects joseph v doria jr a former state senator who was a sponsor of the 1996 law that created charter schools in new jersey and is the dean of the caulfield school of education at st peter s university is seen in his jersey city office kevin r wexler northjersey com the state education department said it does not have the authority to review financing or lease agreements before they are signed and that it doesn t oversee private related companies i disagree i think they have the authority because they re using public money said joseph v doria jr a former state legislator who was an author of the state s charter school law if they feel they don t have the authority just introduce legislation national experts too believe agencies that authorize and oversee charter schools can and should be looking at private groups and their financial dealings i believe a quality authorizer has the ability to intervene and protect the school and the taxpayers from groups entering into related party transactions that aren t in the best interests of students and taxpayers said james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute kipp new jersey s team academy charter school in newark in a statement your request requires the creation of a record which does not presently exist in paper electronic or any other form it also would require the school to conduct research as the precise analysis required to reply to your request had not been conducted by the school quote icon the dearth of public information means for example that taxpayers can t see why the friends of team academy which supports the newark charter school has earned millions of dollars in development fees or how that money is spent taxpayers won t know why uncommon schools donated millions to north star academy but then required that the money be spent on a building owned by a related company taxpayers can t see the agreement that the friends of marion p thomas charter school signed with a developer that had the friends pay out 6 4 million in fees as part of a two building deal the group s attorney would not provide it and the charter school said it did not have a copy and the public won t know precisely how the nonprofit groups that own real estate and rent it to charter schools in camden and paterson spend the money they receive in rent that is over and above what is needed to cover the debt on the buildings we remind you that the network is not a public entity and therefore is not subject to public disclosure requirement but we encourage you to follow up with any relevant charter school in order to obtain the documents you seek the executive director of camden s charter network said in a letter to reporters complex financial details are hidden the public also has no way of knowing the financial details of one of the largest charter school construction projects in the state such as the interest rates on some loans or the debt on the building uncommon schools recently completed an ambitious 69 million project in newark opening a six story building at the start of this school year that was funded with a construction loan and millions of dollars in federal bonds and tax credits a real estate entrepreneur made millions of dollars buying the property and flipping it in a little more than a year to the charter school operator a bank is claiming millions in federal tax credits the federal government is chipping in tens of millions more in school construction aid while state and local taxpayers are paying 3 million a year in rent to repay loans but many of the details of the transaction are not publicly available and uncommon schools has declined to discuss them the building is owned by a private company that was created to hold the property and rent it to the public charter school north star academy adding to the lack of transparency is the number of companies involved in transactions by the largest charter operators uncommon schools spokeswoman barbara martinez in a statement north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark quote icon for example kipp new jersey uses more than a half dozen companies with roles in multiple financial transactions and uncommon schools has at least two dozen companies that have been involved in real estate and in the financing of projects in newark some created for a single transaction six of these called uncommon lenders primarily lend money seven others called uncommon properties borrow the money another 11 companies have been involved in property transactions most of them own or lease buildings uncommon schools and north star said in a statement that because charter schools don t have the same access to facilities or opportunities for financing as district schools they are forced to work with the capital markets to find facilities and financing all of which happens with more complexity than for district schools north star and uncommon have been able to access government programs that were created specifically to spur development and improvements in cities like newark uncommon s spokeswoman barbara martinez wrote in the statement the programs she added lowered the cost of the school s building projects james goenner of the national charter schools institute you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open quote icon some charter operators sought to distance their schools from the groups that own the buildings they use and participate in facilities financing although these entities may be affiliated with team academy charter school they are neither created nor controlled by it nor related to it for federal income tax purposes or accounting purposes one lawyer wrote in response to a request for records the school does not control the manner in which these entities operate or perform the school s board does not appoint members or trustees of any entities north star academy declined to disclose information about the debt on its buildings or to provide financial documents for companies that are subsidiaries of uncommon schools which runs the school it wrote that those companies are separate entities from north star that are not under north star s control goenner of the national charter schools institute said nothing prevents the private groups from being more open you can imagine a private company is going to say we re a private company that s none of your business or they could say we re a private company but we ll share that information transparent and open the state requires charter schools to submit copies of leases and mortgages annually but only for new locations officials said they look to ensure that the length of the lease doesn t exceed the length of the school s charter and that the actual rent is in line with the amount set aside for that purpose in the school s budget college achieve s westervelt avenue building in north plainfield includes a former catholic school building and an addition abbott koloff northjersey com but the state accepted leases that schools signed with one nonprofit management company college achieve public charter schools that did not include the amount they were paying in rent that figure could be calculated only with information in the master lease the contract between the management company and the property owner the state said it does not collect master leases moreover charter schools that college achieve is paid to operate did not always have key details related to their facilities one could not provide a rent schedule or the project cost for its north plainfield location a refurbished and expanded catholic school it subleases from the management company the paterson school meanwhile could show what it pays to college achieve but had no document showing what the management company now pays to lease the building from a third party many of the documents that northjersey com and the usa today network new jersey were initially able to obtain under the state s open public records law required the intervention of an attorney those documents indicate that the management company and not the charter school holds the purchase option on at least two buildings dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities quote icon law leads to private ownership some say the charter school law and regulations have pushed the schools away from building ownership and toward renting from commercial landlords or creating separate companies to own real estate the schools are prohibited from having long term debt that exceeds the value of their property and from entering loans that allow lenders to go after assets other than real estate if they default and they can t use state or local dollars to build a school a provision some say hamstrings charters and leads to confusion over what is permitted that rule has been clarified to say charter schools can t use public money to erect a completely new building allowing for the funding of additions and renovations dwight berg an economist who has served as a financial consultant on charter school projects around the country said it s not a smart law james goenner president and ceo of the national charter schools institute in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind quote icon different attorneys draw different lines and you get all these differing viewpoints of how it s supposed to work berg said to me that s why it s not a smart law right why would you have a law that says a school could buy a building but not a law that says a school could buy a piece of land and construct a building there doesn t seem to be anything positive from that law other than for years i know it s pushed schools away from the smart thing of permanently owning their facilities the groups that hold property for charter schools obtain loans based on a school s public revenues and leases showing how the debt will be covered yet charter school experts said lenders have shown a preference for financing school construction projects through private entities instead of the public charter schools i believe this is just a feeling of the lenders that here s a charter school which can be closed at any time said rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association lenders he said figure that nonprofit groups would continue to operate after the school closes though they would have no income of their own rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association tariq zehawi northjersey com without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building pressler said patrick beausoleil vice president of portfolio development at highmark schools development in utah said the presence of a friends group in a transaction is a perceived comfort for lenders but one that is illusory it s largely a legal comfort level in that if the school did dry up and blow away technically there is recourse with the friends said beausoleil whose firm has developed charter school facilities in new jersey and elsewhere in the country and we all know if the school dries up and blows away it doesn t matter how many layers of others are in the mix if the revenue stream is gone we ve got an empty building and we need another tenant fewer than 20 of new jersey s 88 charter schools own at least one of their buildings directly most rent from private landlords including commercial developers and private nonprofit groups many of which were created to help the charter schools state sen ronald l rice we argue that if they are public schools we should own that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers quote icon many of the leases reviewed for this series require the charter schools to pay all expenses related to the buildings including taxes maintenance and repairs they are known as triple net leases goenner said it is not necessarily the best use of taxpayers money when schools invest heavily in a building that somebody else owns in a triple net lease if the roof leaks and you pay to fix it as the school board and then you decide to leave for another facility you essentially leave your investment in that roof behind goenner said private ownership of public charter school buildings has struck a nerve particularly in newark where the school district has been selling off buildings state sen ronald l rice said he s concerned about what might happen to privately owned charter school buildings in the city private groups he said could sell them years from now and might want to gut and rehab one building and turn it into luxury condos with a view of the new york city skyline rick pressler director of school services for the new jersey charter schools association without the charter school in existence and paying its rent those other entities in most cases would not be able to pay anything although they would be in a position to rent the building quote icon we argue that if they are public schools we should own the buildings said rice a democrat whose district includes part of newark referring to the public that fell on deaf ears no one in government really paid attention to that the bottom line is when they build there should be some way for it to come back to the taxpayers he added team academy charter school recently purchased its first building a former essex county school on 13th street in newark but only because public ownership was a requirement of the sale team s support groups own five other facilities the state issued 12 7 million in tax exempt bonds of which 7 5 million was designated for the purchase and renovations of the building the rest went to renovate other team buildings the loan documents show that the bond proceeds went to the friends of team which planned to lend the school 11 6 million berg the financial adviser who represented the friends in the transaction said public ownership of buildings might become more common if the law is changed my own personal feeling is that owning is probably better in the long run for the school and therefore for the public good he said in the long run real estate is probably going up not down in price he added and schools that own their own buildings wouldn t be subject to increasing rents finding a fix experts say solutions lie in fair funding shared resources and public policy that makes clear how charter schools are supposed to obtain and pay for buildings charter school advocates want access to unused school district buildings and designated funding for facilities i think the best solution is to fund charter schools the way we fund all public schools and then we get rid of the problem entirely pressler said the situation that we ve created in new jersey by denying charter schools access to all of these facilities funds has led us to try to find ways to get this done we need buildings unlike many other states new jersey has no clear mechanism for charter schools to access buildings owned by public school districts the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it pressler added he said it s unclear how many such buildings are available and many need serious renovation so we re still going to have an issue with how do we bring them up to code if it s an older building since charter schools get no facilities aid from the state every dollar spent on a building comes out of each school s operating budget charters spend an average of 13 percent of their revenues on their buildings according to the national alliance for public charter schools rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association the access to buildings we feel like is a really simple one in the sense that these are already buildings that are publicly owned we want to use them for a public school and we should be allowed to do it quote icon pressler noted that whenever a traditional public school district needs money to acquire or build a new structure it simply asks voters to pass referenda that generate additional tax revenues that effectively shield their operating budgets from debt payments traditional public schools may get facilities funding from the state for their projects and the state schools development authority funds and manages school construction projects for new jersey s 31 poorest districts it also has provided grants to regular districts pressler acknowledged that in some cases federal money has been attached to bonds that are issued to finance charter school projects but he said state and local taxpayers don t see a rate increase when a charter school constructs or renovates a building if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year he said my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building charter schools on average receive about 73 cents on the dollar in local and state aid compared with traditional public schools according to the state charter association the law requires districts to send charter schools 90 percent of what they receive in local taxes and in some state aid for each student much of the disparity is due to so called adjustment aid that some districts receive some schools receive much less for example asbury park charter schools received 42 percent of district per pupil funding in the 2017 18 school year while those in jersey city got 60 percent according to the association rick pressler of the new jersey charter schools association if you re paying a charter school a million dollars a year and they build a building you re still only paying that charter school a million dollars a year my tax bill doesn t go up when the charter school builds a building it does go up when the district builds a building quote icon charter school advocates said the funding disparity makes it difficult for some schools to find affordable financing schools and their support groups have taken out interest only loans and are required to pay hefty fees to get out of the agreements once they become financially stable and are able to get a better deal the beloved community charter school in jersey city for example plans to pay such a fee next year if you had the funding formula working the way it was intended to when the charter law was passed that by itself would have enabled a school to directly buy and hold real estate because it could have afforded to pay principal and interest said bret schundler beloved s founder and a former state education commissioner all charter schools in my opinion should get some kind of increment for facility purposes he said an additional 1 500 per pupil would be enough for most charter schools education experts say that some charter school boards are not equipped to navigate real estate transactions leading to costly deals that can drain money from education the friends of marion p thomas charter school paid a 67 percent premium in addition to renovation costs when it exited a lease early and bought two buildings from a developer the group could have purchased them for 6 million but couldn t find financing instead it paid the developer who owned one of the buildings for only two months 16 million green the university of connecticut professor said that avoiding such deals would require a level of sophistication that many charter school boards simply can t muster i think that one of the things that maybe the state could do is to actually educate charter school boards on real estate arrangements as part of the training of what your fiduciary duties are he said new jersey has just one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charter schools goenner advocates for multiple authorizers in each state and ensuring they re adequately staffed nine years ago he directed an authorizing office at central michigan university that had a staff of 30 to oversee 60 michigan charter schools that s six times the staff that oversees new jersey s 88 charter schools twenty states have more than one office tasked with authorizing and overseeing charters bruce baker a rutgers university professor and an authority on education financing we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms quote icon the new jersey charter schools association has suggested that the state s law be amended to allow for an independent chartering board as an additional authorizer having multiple authorizers goenner said allows for trying different approaches that lead to continuous improvement and evolution and proper staffing he said is critical because authorizers serve an important check and balance to ensure that the kids are learning and that the taxpayers money is well stewarded baker the rutgers professor said there should be more coordination among school districts and charter schools like pressler he suggested funding charter school facilities like traditional schools with the provision that the buildings are owned by the public he said the state should create some centralized authority that would issue bonds to finance construction of charter school buildings or to make improvements the bonds could be issued by traditional districts with voter approval it would work like other bond debt for public projects he said and taxpayers would pay for it we can invest public dollars in buildings that are still owned by the public but perhaps used by the charters baker said these would be need based publicly owned facilities financed with more traditional public financing mechanisms in los angeles for example the city s school district used 600 million in federal school construction bonds to build schools that are owned by the public and used by both traditional and charter schools the district bills the charter schools based on the amount of space they use to cover their share of annual debt payments on the bonds maintenance and other costs including security in contrast new jersey gave most of its share of the federal bonds more than 400 million to the state s two largest charter operators over the past 10 years to fund building projects that are owned by private groups that support the schools baker said moving to a public ownership and public investment model would take care of other problems such as a lack of transparency on the part of some private groups that own charter school buildings i don t know that we can fully imagine all of the types of transactions we would have to identify to regulate them he said the better more efficient way to go about it is just to eliminate entirely all these complex mechanisms students in the cafeteria at the princeton charter school amy newman northjersey com photo illustration jodi miskell usa today network and getty images charters that own their buildings charter schools have become a familiar part of the education landscape yet finding and financing a facility can still be difficult and costly for many of them elements of the law remain a problem and some experts say proper funding assistance in obtaining loans and a clear way to access unused space in the traditional public school districts are lacking academics point to an absence of public policy on the matter as a result most charter schools do not own their buildings this means the public puts money into facilities it does not own and cannot recoup if the property is sold but a smaller number of charter schools have managed to own at least one of their buildings directly here s how they did it the princeton charter school owns its buildings amy newman northjersey com princeton charter school before the princeton charter school opened in 1997 its founders had a lot to contemplate how do you fundraise for a building when you have no school how do you buy one when you have no money how do you build a school when state law says you can t use public funds to construct one peter n yianilos one of the founders said they pondered that chicken and egg problem along with a host of others today the school has a thriving 7 acre campus of 424 students and four buildings one for kindergarten through fourth graders another for fifth through eighth graders and a campus center that opened in 2010 that includes a theater a gymnasium an art studio and music classrooms i m very proud of how this happened yianilos said noting this isn t a school that was built by a single big grant or one wealthy person that simply did it it started with nothing peter n yianilos one of the founders of the princeton charter school the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building quote icon the group s first challenge was a practical one finding usable space within princeton we looked around and we had very few options yianilos recalled the group pinned its hopes on a large tract with two buildings a farmhouse and an office building but the realtor didn t want to talk to them didn t know what a charter school was and wanted a bona fide buyer the only way i was able to get the building was to ignore the realtor and walk in the front door introduce myself and say i want to buy your building yianilos recalled the price struck was 2 8 million but like any newly approved charter it had no money just a fast approaching deadline to get the school up and running you have no public funds because the students haven t attended yet yianilos said they talked to banks a lot of them they did some fundraising we didn t have a large down payment yianilos said it s also difficult to fundraise when there is no school he persuaded bankers to agree that if a substantial portion of the loan was guaranteed it would be viewed as equity in the property and the bank would loan against it in all there were 21 guarantors that secured amounts between 10 000 and 50 000 most were in the 20 000 to 25 000 range the bank meanwhile agreed to accept statements from accountants confirming their net worth was sufficient to back whatever portion of the loan they guaranteed their downside was limited and that made it something that people could contemplate doing yianilos said the school borrowed 2 15 million from a bank and another 500 000 from the owner and records show yianilos and three others lent the school another 200 000 money was just one piece of the equation the founders yianilos said were scratching our heads at the time and thinking a lot about who owns the building founders ultimately decided that having the school own the property was a straightforward simple approach to take he said that way tax dollars put into the buildings wouldn t be lost to the public the hope academy charter school purchased its asbury park building which is on grand avenue asbury park press file hope academy in asbury asbury park s hope academy charter school opened in 2001 in a church owned property and as it grew rented more space at another nearby church when it learned that one of the buildings was up for sale it started looking for a new home as a result hope academy landed in a multi story office building on grand avenue its rent began at 144 000 annually with the school responsible for repairs and maintenance as well as a proportionate share of real estate taxes and other building costs the landlord fell into financial trouble and the school was eventually making lease payments to a court appointed rent receiver chief school administrator davisha pratt said the owner was on the verge of losing the building which she described as neglected but alexis crawford the school s founder and retired director said the charter school was not in a position to buy it donna torres hope academy s business administrator we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen quote icon that was always a part of the vision to own the building crawford said in 2011 a non profit called build with purpose intervened agreeing to purchase and renovate the building and lease it to the charter school we bought the property as a service an emergency interim measure and then took out financing to improve the property said brian keenan president of build with purpose the school s new lease started rent at 345 000 annually it could buy the building at any time at a price to be reasonable determined by landlord and tenant it was required to pay a 50 000 purchase option fee and make a 125 000 contribution to building improvements under the lease the landlord picked up roof and structural repairs but the school was responsible for everything else from windows doors and floors to plumbing heating and air conditioning systems we were just putting out a lot of money for improvements i didn t like improving a building that wasn t ours and then not even knowing if they sold it what would happen said hope academy s business administrator donna torres she added that buying the building would give us stability and then when we did the improvements we d be improving our own building since we were paying for it anyway at the end of 2016 hope academy bought the building for 4 3 million it received a more than 1 million direct loan from the new jersey economic development authority which also issued 3 million in tax exempt bonds for the school s benefit literally they can call it their home pratt said of the students we don t have to worry about being uprooted today hope academy s combined annual payments on those debts are 240 937 nearly 45 percent less than the 435 750 they would have been paying in rent this school year had they continued to lease vincent and magda derosa of lincoln park founded the classical academy charter school of clifton which opened in 1998 they are standing in front of the school s original building which the academy still owns but no longer uses amy newman northjersey com classical academy in clifton vincent derosa a former public school teacher in glen rock had his eye on a nursing home perched on a hill for a new charter school he planned to open in clifton a little more than 20 years ago when he was told the nursing home was moving out he quickly moved to rent it the classical academy charter school opened in 1998 the second year that charter schools could operate in the state the school rented the former nursing home overlooking valley road with an option to purchase it for more than three years it paid 710 000 to purchase the building in 2002 using two separate loans from the same bank the first loan was scheduled to be repaid in five years the second in 15 years there was never any question about whether the school could own its own building derosa said the state was always aware of our actions and it never became any kind of issue he said the second loan was repaid early derosa said and the school owned the building free and clear in 2009 that allowed the small school 120 students in grades 6 through 8 to save on interest payments and put away some of its public revenue derosa said he was able to have the building painted and wire it for computers if you don t have control of your facility and it s in the hands of another party anything can happen derosa said we felt the sooner we paid off the building that would free up money for education costs when derosa retired a few years ago he said the school had 1 million in cash surplus then he said new leadership took over two years ago they moved out of the valley road building and began renting a school building owned by st paul s roman catholic parish the new building has more than 23 000 square feet of space according to the paterson diocese website including a gym cafeteria and library classical academy was approved last month to expand by 60 students 20 per class for a total of 180 for the next school year according to records that the school provided in response to a public records request last year the state rejected the school s first request to expand which was made shortly after it moved state records show that classical academy was scheduled to pay a little more than 260 000 in annual rent in its first two years in its new home it has an option to renew its lease for three years at the end of this school year the head of the school sandra giordano declined to discuss the academy s finances and real estate transactions she did not respond to questions emailed to her about the school s plans derosa said the school took a risk by moving into a new building before it received the state s approval to increase its enrollment the rent over the past two years he said was high for such a small school he followed up in a letter writing that by the end of this school year the academy s administration will have needlessly spent over 500 000 of school money on a lease for a privately owned building when they themselves own a fully paid school building in which for 16 years students had received the best of public school education the move he wrote was a shockingly poor spending decision

background foreign investment what is the prevailing attitude towards foreign investment belgium has adopted a positive attitude towards foreign direct investment that its economy is reliant upon the federal state and the country s three federated regions brussels flanders and wallonia actively seek to attract increase and retain foreign investment for example the belgian government has undertaken to reform the kingdom s company law and to gradually reduce the corporate income tax rates in 2018 and 2020 what are the main sectors for foreign investment in the state benefiting from its central geographic location in europe its highly developed transport network including the port of antwerp europe s second largest seaport and brussels being home to many european and international institutions belgium has attracted foreign investment across numerous sectors notably agribusiness aeronautics and space environmental technologies life sciences engineering and new materials transport and logistics digital finance insurance and energy is there a net inflow or outflow of foreign direct investment historically belgium has been a capital exporting country while foreign inward direct investment reached an all time high of us 30 billion in 2016 it dropped to us 801 million in 2017 mostly because of the ending of tax measures such as the notional interest deduction and the dividend withholding tax exemption aimed at attracting multinational enterprises rather than a fall in foreign investment projects to this end 2017 was the most prolific year for belgium in a decade with more than 200 new projects by contrast foreign outward direct investment remained stable from us 22 billion in 2016 to us 20 billion in 2017 investment agreement legislation describe domestic legislation governing investment agreements with the state or state owned entities there is no domestic legislation specifically addressing investment agreements with the state or with state owned entities general principles of contractual and potentially administrative law will apply article 1676 3 of the belgian code of civil procedure expressly allows public entities to have recourse to arbitration with respect to agreements they conclude international legal obligations investment treaties identify and give brief details of the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party also indicating whether they are in force belgium concluded about 100 bilateral investment treaties bits between 1964 and 2010 most of them through the belgo luxembourg economic union bleu see question 17 these bits have mainly been concluded with countries that are not members of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd while most of the bits remain in force today about 20 did not enter into force and a further 10 were terminated and sometimes replaced almost every bit contains a specific investor state dispute settlement mechanism usually refered to during proceedings before an ad hoc arbitral tribunal sitting under the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral rules proceedings before the international centre for settlement of investment disputes icsid proceedings before the international chamber of commerce icc or proceedings before the arbitration institute of the stockholm chamber of commerce scc certain bits require investors to seize first for a determined period of time belgian domestic courts for concluded bits either by belgium or through the bleu see as an eu member state belgium is also bound by investment treaties concluded by the european union on behalf of its member states such as the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta with canada belgium is also a party to the energy charter treaty ect which it signed on 17 december 1994 and which entered into force on 6 august 1998 if applicable indicate whether the bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which the state is a party extend to overseas territories belgium has no overseas territories has the state amended or entered into additional protocols affecting bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which it is a party except for the protocol on energy efficiency and related environmental aspects of 1994 and the amendment to the trade related provisions of the energy charter treaty of 1998 belgium has not entered into any protocol or amendment affecting investment treaties to which it is a party has the state unilaterally terminated any bilateral or multilateral investment treaties to which it is a party belgium has neither unilaterally terminated nor denounced any investment treaty since the second world war however bolivia and south africa denounced the bit respectively in 2013 and 2014 they had entered into with the bleu however they contained a sunset clause granting protection to investors for a period of 10 years following termination a few bits were terminated because they were replaced by renewed bits between the relevant states has the state entered into multiple bilateral or multilateral investment treaties with overlapping membership bits concluded by the bleu with states outside the european union overlap with investment treaties concluded by the latter by virtue of regulation eu no 1219 2012 such bits remain in force and in parallel but the european commission has the power to indicate appropriate measures to be taken by belgium and the bleu if it considers that an existing bit constitutes a serious obstacle to the negotiation or conclusion of eu investment treaties furthermore with regard to the energy sector belgium is part of the energy charter treaty ect that overlaps with many bits entered into by belgium with other ect contracting states under article 16 of the ect nothing in the treaty shall be construed as derogating from any bit provision and nothing in the bits shall be construed as derogating from any provision of the ect where any such provision is more favourable to the investor or investment the bits concluded by the bleu with other eu member states croatia cyprus the czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta romania slovakia and slovenia are considered by the european commission and the court of justice of the european union cjeu as overlapping with eu law in particular with the fundamental freedoms of the internal market in its recent ground breaking achmea ruling the cjeu has ruled that the investor state arbitration mechanisms of intra eu bits are incompatible with the principle of autonomy of eu law as a result the european commission has requested that eu member states terminate their intra eu bits and indicates that it considers that the investor state dispute resolution mechanism contained in the ect cannot be applied to intra eu disputes belgium s position remains to be seen but it is likely to abide by the european commission s interpretation of the cjeu s decision see update and trends icsid convention is the state party to the icsid convention belgium is a party to the icsid convention 1965 which has been in force since 26 september 1970 the minister of foreign affairs has

the mauritius convention on 15 september 2015 but has not yet ratified it investment treaty programme does the state have an investment treaty programme in 2009 by virtue of the lisbon treaty the external trade policy became an exclusive competence of the european union which means that in principle eu member states have been precluded from entering into new bits since then before this date belgium had concluded approximately 100 bits most of them through the bleu pursuant to regulation eu no 1219 2012 eu member states may seek the european commission s authorisation to conclude new bits

investment treaties an investor is defined by the bleu model bit article 1 1 and most bleu bits as any natural person who is considered as a citizen of one of the contracting states according to the legislation of that state or any legal person constituted in accordance with the legislation of one of the contracting states and having its registered office in the territory of that state some bits do not require the presence of a registered office while a handful of them require the presence of business activity or residence subject to a couple of exceptions the bleu bits do not foresee the possibility of a company controlled by an investor to be considered as an investor itself the bleu model bit article 2 defines investments as any kind of assets and any direct or indirect contribution in cash in kind or in services invested or reinvested in any sector of economic activity it further provides a non exhaustive list of protected investment a movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem such as mortgages liens pledges usufruct and similar rights b shares corporate rights and any other kind of shareholdings including minority or indirect ones in companies constituted in the territory of one contracting party c bonds claims to money and to any performance having an economic value d copyrights industrial property rights technical processes trade names and goodwill e concessions granted under public law or under contract including concessions to explore develop extract or exploit natural resources finally it makes clear that changes in the legal form in which assets and capital have been invested or reinvested shall not affect their designation as investments for the purpose of this agreement most bleu bits contain this definition although some of the listed items sometimes differ and part of the older bits merely define investment as any kind of asset a couple of bits exclude certain fields and or dealings with states including state owned entities from their scope of application finally a handful of bleu bits require investments to be made in accordance with national law or to have received prior written approval from the relevant state s competent authorities protections what substantive protections are typically available the bleu model bit and most bleu bits grants investors protection in the articles that follow fair and equitable treatment and continuous protection and security with the exception of measures required to maintain public order article 3 national treatment and most favoured nation treatment with the exceptions of tax matters and privileges granted by one contracting state to investors of a third state by virtue of its participation or association in a regional economic organisation article 4 prohibition of expropriation or nationalisation or any other measure having the effect of directly or indirectly dispossessing investors of their investments unless reasons of public purpose security or national interest require a derogation in which case the measures must be taken under due process of law neither discriminatory nor contrary to any specific commitments accompanied by

belgium is part to both the icsid convention of 1965 which entered into force on 26 september 1970 and the un convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 1958 new york

seated against unfavourable awards not applicable provisions hindering enforcement give details of any domestic legal provisions that may hinder the enforcement of awards against the state within its territory as a general rule article 1412bis of the belgian code of civil procedure exempts from attachment and enforcement all assets belonging to the belgian state in the broadest sense including the federated entities the provinces the municipalities public interest agencies and public law corporations however public entities are required to draw up a list of assets that can be attached if they do not or if the listed assets are not sufficient to satisfy the creditor s claim assets that are manifestly not useful for the public entity s mission or the continuity of public service can be attached by the creditor in that case the public entity may replace the attached assets by other assets of its choice present on the belgian territory and sufficient to satisfy the claim if the public entity considers that the attached assets are useful for its mission or the continuity of public service it may oppose the attachment before belgian courts with respect to enforcement of awards against foreign states belgium has recently modified its rules on state immunity from enforcement by adopting the act of 23 august 2015 inserting a new article 1412quinquies to the belgian code of civil procedure under this provision foreign states assets located in belgium cannot be subject to enforcement proceedings by creditors save for three narrow exceptions the foreign state has expressly and specifically consented to the seizure of the assets the foreign state has reserved or allocated the assets to the enforcement of the claim that gives rise to the seizure or the assets are used for an economic or commercial activity as opposed to a public service activity and relate to the entity against which the enforceable title or authentic or private documents are addressed this act is widely seen as a consequence of the diplomatic crisis caused by the launching of attachment and enforcement proceedings against russia by former yukos shareholders in particular the vehicle company yukos universal ltd in conjunction with a us hedge fund holding debt securities against argentina yukos universal ltd filed an application against the new regime before the belgian constitutional court the applicants alleged that it breached the principles of equality and non discrimination by imposing disproportionate hurdles to creditors of foreign states as compared to other types of creditors the application was dismissed by the constitutional court in decision no 48 2017 of 27 april 2017 the court considered that the difference in treatment relied on an objective criterion ie the nature of the debtor was legitimated by the act s aim of fostering international comity and was proportionate because it reflects customary international law the court did however strike out for the first exception the requirement that the state must have specifically consented to the seizure finding that this went too far as compared to customary international law update and trends current developments are there any emerging trends or hot topics in your jurisdiction cjeu achmea ruling in its seminal slovak republic v achmea ruling of 5 march 2018 case c 284 16 the cjeu held that the arbitration clause provided for by the 1991 netherlands slovakia bit was incompatible with the principle of autonomy of eu law because an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in article 8 of the may be called upon to interpret or apply eu law particularly the provisions on freedom of establishment and free movement of capital while it cannot make preliminary references to the cjeu and at the annulment and enforcement stages is not subject to sufficient review by a court of a member state capable of ensuring compatibility with eu law in the wake of the achmea ruling the european commission stated in a communication of july 2018 that all investor state arbitration clauses in intra eu bits are inapplicable and that any arbitration tribunal established on the basis of such clauses lacks jurisdiction due to the absence of a valid arbitration agreement as a consequence national courts are under the obligation to annul any arbitral award rendered on that basis and to refuse to enforce it member states that are parties to pending cases in whatever capacity must also draw all necessary consequences from the achmea judgment moreover pursuant to the principle of legal certainty they are bound to formally terminate their intra eu bits the achmea judgment is also relevant for the investor state arbitration mechanism established in article 26 of the energy charter treaty as regards intra eu relations belgium is likely to abide by this interpretation of the consequences of the cjeu s ruling opinion 1 17 the existence of an investment court system ics in ceta was one of the core reasons put forward by the wallonia region for refusing to agree to the signature of the treaty by the belgian government in a nutshell the ics provides for a break from the ad hoc arbitration system to a permanent and institutionalised court whose members subject to strict independence and impartiality requirements are appointed in advance by the states that are party to the treaty and a joint committee of these states instead of being appointed on a case by case basis by the investor and the state involved in the dispute the decision of this court is subject to appellate mechanisms as opposed to traditional investment arbitration mechanisms which only provide for one instance on the merits the wallonia region finally gave its agreement to the signature of the treaty after intense political pressure subject to an agreement that belgium would refer the validity of the ceta s ics to the cjeu as a result on 6 september 2017 belgium requested the cjeu render an opinion on the compatibility of the ceta s ics with eu law in particular with the exclusive competence of the cjeu to provide the definitive interpretation of eu law the general principle of equality and the practical effect requirement of eu law the right of access to the courts and the right to an independent and impartial judiciary the wallonia region specified that belgium does not take any position itself regarding questions request for an opinion submitted by the belgian government pursuant to article 218 11 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union opinion 1 17 oj 369 30 october 2017 given its conclusions in achmea the cjeu may consider that the principle of the eu s autonomous legal order would be breached if an international investment court were to provide for a binding interpretation of eu law without the possibility to refer the case for preliminary ruling to the cjeu the hearing before the cjeu took place on 26 june 2018 the advocate general s opinion is expected on 23 october 2018

file photo european central bank ecb president mario draghi speaks at the 28th frankfurt european banking congress ebc at the old opera house in frankfurt germany november 16 2018 reuters ralph orlowski file photo by dhara ranasinghe jennifer ablan and virginia furness london new york reuters whatever it takes is a daunting legacy for any departing central bank chief to bequeath a successor and leaves world markets anxious about what is to come after mario draghi leaves the european central bank later this year draghi s 2012 pledge to save the euro won the confidence of financial markets and arrested the currency bloc s debt crisis investors admired his willingness to break new policy ground manoeuvring past internal and external opposition and clear communication of the ecb s thinking with growth and inflation flagging again and the ecb s policy arsenal depleted whoever succeeds him may need to be similarly bold growing questions about the orthodoxies of economic policy including monetary policy models could present an additional test mohamed el erian chief economic adviser for allianz se in california said replacing draghi if badly handled could create significant uncertainty at a time when the ecb faces slowing economic momentum add to that concern about the eroding effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies and the list of challenges facing the next ecb president gets quite significant said el erian a long time central bank observer big questions draghi nicknamed super mario looks set to end his eight year term without having ever executed a rate rise but after years of ultra easy monetary policy including negative interest rates and an unprecedented 2 6 trillion euro asset purchase scheme economic growth is weakening yet again inflation is below the ecb s near 2 percent target and germany s 10 year bond yield has dropped back below zero investors fear the ecb s window to normalise policy has closed meaning it has little in its toolkit to face the next recession like other central banks it is also struggling to explain why falling jobless rates have failed to lift inflation market expectations for which are at their lowest since 2016 after weak german data on friday exacerbated growth fears story continues this raises big questions for the next ecb head to be appointed by politicians probably after the european parliament elections in may could a weak economy force a revival of quantitative easing qe with possible stock purchases given a scarcity of eligible bonds and to prevent a japanese style low inflation low growth rut the next ecb chief may have to mull unorthodox policy steps adopted by the bank of japan such as yield curve control the issue of having too few tools for the next slowdown is a challenge for all central banks but in the case of the ecb you could have a big political crisis to deal with as well as the more normal central banking day job said andrew balls global fixed income cio at pimco potential candidates for the job are already discussing these possibilities finnish central bank chief olli rehn seen as an outside tip said this month that the ecb should follow the u s federal reserve and review its entire policy framework given the failure to lift inflation after years of extraordinary stimulus inflation has been below the ecb s target since 2013 for francesco papadia former ecb head of market operations the balance sheet remains a key tool if further action is needed to shore up the economy the hefty asset purchases under draghi have doubled the ecb s balance sheet to 4 68 trillion euros the scarcity of some bonds could be dealt with the inventiveness the ecb has shown over the years for instance they could purchase bank loans or equities like the boj said papadia they could also come up with completely new tools consistent with their record of bold innovations economists polled by reuters favoured ecb board member benoit coeure to succeed draghi but saw finland s erkki liikanen as a more likely choice rehn german jens weidmann long a policy hawk to draghi s dove and france s francois villeroy de galhau are also potential candidates nobody can be more dovish than draghi whoever it is is going to be on the more hawkish end said giles rothbarth portfolio manager in blackrock s european equity team for a poll on the ecb race for a biography of contenders big shoes to fill few had predicted the ecb s change of speed after draghi took over from jean claude trichet in november 2011 with the debt crisis raging draghi had soon overridden northern european concerns about money printing draghi is big shoes to fill his whatever it takes speech is precisely what was needed at the time said bob michele head of global fixed income at jpmorgan asset management investors said the ability to communicate with markets and the boldness to fight a crisis were crucial qualities for a successor and that they valued stability more than asset performance during a central bank chief s tenure returns on the euro have fallen 17 percent during draghi s term while those on bank stocks are 1 percent lower the euro rallied 10 percent in the year after that july 2012 speech however while italy s 10 year bond yield dropped to around 4 percent from above 6 percent an analysis of introductory policy statements by ecb economists shows they generally became easier to read under draghi for former goldman sachs economist jim o neill draghi bank of england governor mark carney and fed chairman jerome powell represent a step forward as central bank heads because they have experience beyond academic circles all three worked at banks powell and carney have government experience while draghi later worked at the world bank whoever replaces mario i hope they are as open minded savvy and not too narrow minded economists said o neill for an explainer on the ecb s grand shuffle high flux half the ecb board and more than a third of the rate setting governing council will be replaced this year richard barwell a former boe economist and head of macro research at bnp paribas asset management in london said the reality is the loss of an entire dream team that has driven the policy agenda coeure for example was a dynamic force in the ecb s market operations team that designs key crisis fighting tools belgian peter praet brought

testimony douglas holtz eakin united states house of representatives committee on ways and means the views expressed here are my own and not those of the american action forum i have benefitted enormously from numerous discussions with my colleague gordon gray i thank ben gits and tom lee for their assistance chairman neal ranking member brady and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to discuss the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act tcja now that it has been law for about 15 months i believe it is important to frame any evaluation of the tcja relative to the rationale for tax reform in the first place the weak u s economic outlook having identified the problem we should consider whether the major provisions of the tcja addressed the deficiencies of the tax code examine recent economic performance and assess the degree to which this can be tied to the tcja itself finally it is important to discuss how best to evaluate more definitively in the future as part of this assessment i would like to make three points the overriding rationale for the tcja was the need for better incentives for long term economic growth improving disappointing wage growth and raising the growth of the standard of living for american families the tcja while imperfect addressed many of the most anti growth elements of the old tax code and s economic performance has improved meaningfully since the passage of the tcja including objectives like top line economic growth business investment and wage growth this is promising but not definitive at this juncture it is simply premature to pass judgement on the tcja let me discuss these in turn the growth challenge and tax reform as of 2017 the need to support more rapid trend economic growth was the preeminent policy challenge the nation experienced a disappointing recovery from the most recent recession and was confronted with a future defined by weak long term economic growth left unaddressed this trajectory would leave to the next generation a less secure and less prosperous nation the figure below shows quarterly year over year growth rates for real gross domestic product gdp beginning with the official end of the great recession in june of 2009 as shown real gdp growth had been stubbornly weak averaging 1 9 percent annually the dotted line while recoveries from recessions precipitated by financial crises tend to be weaker the persistence of the nation s weak economy should not have been considered inevitable but rather as an encouragement to implement better economic policy a related shortcoming had been the growth in productivity see below in recent years the actual growth in productivity had fallen below its recent trend 2001 to 2007 and far below the postwar average 1947 to 2007 accepting diminished productivity growth would mean being resigned to slow growth in real inflation adjusted wages and labor incomes household income a metric that more working americans can appreciate underscores the tepid economic recovery according to the u s census bureau earnings growth of men and women who worked full time and year round was essentially zero in 2016 the final essential building block for stronger trend economic growth is growth in the labor force the population willing and able to work as a share of the population the labor force had declined from historical highs in 2000 but this decline accelerated after the great recession even more troubling than the poor recovery was the fact that the congressional budget office cbo projected poor economic growth averaging at best 2 percent per year in the future that rate of growth is certainly below that needed to improve the standard of living at the pace typically enjoyed in post war america during the early postwar period from 1947 to 1969 trend economic growth rates were quite rapid gdp and gdp per capita grew at rates of 4 0 percent and 2 4 percent respectively over the subsequent 25 years however these rates fell to 2 9 percent and 1 9 percent respectively during the years 1986 to 2007 trend growth in gdp recovered to 3 2 percent while trend gdp per capita growth rose to 2 0 percent these rates were quite close to the overall historic performance for the period the lesson of these distinct periods is that the trend growth rate is far from a fixed immutable economic law that dictates the pace of expansion but rather is subject to outside influences including public policy the trend growth rate of postwar gdp per capita a rough measure of the standard of living has been about 2 1 percent as the table below indicates at this pace of expansion an individual could expect the standard of living to double in 30 to 35 years put differently during the course of one s working career the overall ability to support a family and pursue retirement would become twice as large in contrast the long term growth rate of gdp in the most recent cbo projection is 1 8 percent when combined with population growth of 0 8 percent this implies the trend growth in gdp per capita will average about 1 0 percent at that pace of expansion it will take 70 years to double income per person the american dream is disappearing over the horizon more rapid growth is not an abstract goal faster growth is essential to the well being of american families the need for tax reform economic performance was not the only spur to tax reform prior to the enactment of the tcja the u s tax code was broadly viewed as broken and in need of repair and for good reason international competitiveness and headquarter decisions prior to the enactment of the tcja the u s corporate tax code remained largely unchanged for decades with the last major rate reduction passed by congress in 1986 during the interim competitor nations made significant changes to their business tax systems by reducing tax rates and moving away from the taxation of worldwide income relative to other major economies the united states went from being roughly on par with major trading partners to imposing the highest statutory rate of tax on corporation income while less stark than the united states s high statutory rate the united states also imposed large effective rates according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers companies headquartered in the united states faced an average effective tax rate of 27 7 percent compared to a rate of 19 5 percent for their foreign headquartered counterparts by country u s headquartered companies faced a higher worldwide effective tax rate than their counterparts headquartered in 53 of the 58 foreign countries the united states failed another competitiveness test in the design of its international tax system the u s corporation income tax applied to the worldwide earnings of u s headquartered firms u s companies paid u s income taxes on income earned both domestically and abroad although the united states allows a foreign tax credit up to the u s tax liability for taxes paid to foreign governments active income earned in foreign countries was generally only subject to u s income tax once it was repatriated giving an incentive for companies to reinvest earnings anywhere but in the united states this system distorted the international behavior of u s firms and essentially trapped foreign earnings that might otherwise be repatriated back to the united states while the united states maintained an international tax system that disadvantaged u s firms competing abroad many u s trading partners shifted toward territorial systems that exempt either entirely or to a large degree foreign source income of the 34 economies in the organisation for economic co operation and development for example 29 have adopted systems with some form of exemption or deduction for dividend income one manifestation of the competitive disadvantage faced by u s corporations was decisions on the location of headquarters the issue of so called inversions remained at the forefront of tax policy and politics originally tax inversions involved a single company flipping the roles of u s headquarters and foreign subsidiary i e inverting tax changes in the early 2000s largely ended this practice next whenever a u s firm sought to acquire or merge with a foreign firm the tax advantages of being subjected to a lower rate and a territorial base made it inevitable that the combined firm would be headquartered outside the united states in these cases inversions took place in the context of these otherwise strategic and valued business opportunities most recently foreign firms have recognized that freeing u s companies of their tax disadvantage allows foreign acquirers to use the same capital technologies and workers more effectively inversions were occurring because foreign firms were acquiring u s firms a macroeconomic analysis of former house ways and means chairman camp s tax reform proposal is instructive on the incentives inherent in the old tax code for capital flight john diamond and george zodrow examined how reform similar to that proposed by former chairman camp would affect capital flows compared to pre tcja law in the long run the authors estimated that a reform that lowered corporate rates and moved to an internationally competitive divided exemption system would increase u s holdings of firm specific capital by 23 5 percent while the net change in domestic ordinary capital would be a 5 percent increase it is important to note that these are relative measurements they were relative to current law at the time if the spate of announcements of inversions in the years leading up to the enactment of the tcja is any indication the old tax code was inducing capital flight accordingly the 23 5 percent and 5 percent increases in firm specific and ordinary stock respectively may be interpreted in part as the effect of precluding future tax inversions placing a value on this potential equity flight is uncertain but based on these estimates roughly 15 percent or 876 billion in u s based capital was estimated to be at risk of moving overseas under the old code finally it is an important reminder that the burden of the corporate tax is borne by everyone corporations are not walled off from the broader economy and neither are the taxes imposed on corporate income taxes on corporations fall on stockholders employees and consumers alike the incidence of the corporate tax continues to be debated but it is clear that the burden on labor must be acknowledged a survey compiled by the president s council of economic advisers aptly summarizes the economics literature and finds that while differing greatly empirical estimates have been trending upwards over time reflecting the dynamism of global capital flows that characterize the modern economy one study by economists at the american enterprise institute for example concluded that for every 1 percent increase in corporate tax rates wages decrease by 1 percent flaws in the individual tax code as taxpayers rediscover every april the u s code has been complex confusing costly to operate and comply with and leaves taxpayers distrustful that everyone is paying the share congress intended in 2016 over 150 million individual tax returns were filed covering over 10 2 trillion in income these returns also include millions of businesses that do not file as c corporations as of 2012 there were 31 1 million non farm businesses filing tax returns 23 6 million sole proprietors 4 2 million s corporations and 3 4 million partnerships including limited liability companies the internal revenue service irs also recognized 1 6 million c corporations the tax system is often the most direct interface between individuals and businesses and the federal government unfortunately that experience is often deeply unsatisfactory the irs has 1 186 forms with which taxpayers must contend and requires an average of 11 8 hours per paperwork submission the overall burden on taxpayers is 8 1 billion hours in paperwork burden imposed by the tax collection system on taxpayers as many americans have experienced the tax filing process is extremely time intensive and often requires the help of outside expertise tax compliance is so onerous for individual taxpayers over 90 percent of individual taxpayers used a preparer or tax software to prepare their returns the taxpayer advocate service tas the watchdog office within the irs has stated that complexity is the single most serious problem with the tax code fichtner and feldman assessed the costs that the u s tax code extracts taxpayers through complexity and inefficiency the study finds that in addition to time and money expended in compliance foregone economic growth and lobbying expenditures amount to hidden costs are estimated to range from 215 billion to 987 billion recent economic developments there has been a meaningful improvement in the pace of economic growth over the past two years let me begin with gdp growth measured as the growth from the same quarter in the previous year as shown below year over year gdp growth has accelerated steadily from a low of 1 3 percent in the 2nd quarter of 2106 to a 3 1 percent in the 4th quarter of 2018 an important source of this acceleration is an increase in the pace of business investment household spending growth as measured by personal consumption expenditures has been rising steadily and solidly between 2 4 percent and 2 9 percent year over year over this period as shown in the chart below however non residential fixed investment business fixed investment has grown much more rapidly since the start of 2017 and even faster nearly 7 percent versus just over 5 percent annually in the past year the more rapid growth in gdp has translated into a very strong labor market after creating an average of 193 000 jobs monthly in 2016 it has averaged 201 000 new jobs in 2017 and 2018 accelerating to an average of 223 000 in 2018 this acceleration is an especially remarkable accomplishment this late in the expansion when one might have expected the labor force participation and unemployment rates to stabilize had that been the case job growth would have averaged roughly 90 000 per month instead the unemployment rate has plummeted sharply to below 4 0 percent see below as the labor market continued to heat up competition for workers has become more fierce and has led to rising wages and other compensation the best measure of wage and non wage compensation is the employment cost index eci from the bureau of labor statistics bls as can be seen in the chart below wage growth in 2018 has been about 3 percent annually higher than the same quarter in 2017 and up noticeably since prior to 2016 moreover wage gains have been widely shared the bls provide data on weekly earnings of full time workers at a variety of points in the earnings distribution the 10th percentile low paid workers the 50th percentile or median and the 90th percentile highly paid workers the year over year growth in these wages is displayed in the chart below clearly nominal wages have been rising across the distribution more important however wage increases have been the most rapid at the 10th percentile since the start of 2018 evaluating the tcja how much of the recent improvement in economic performance can be attributed to the tcja as a matter of economic science it is certainly too soon to say but there are good reasons to credit the new law the tcja addressed some of the most glaring flaws in the business tax code it lowered the corporation income tax rate to a more globally competitive 21 percent enhanced incentives to investment in equipment addressed some of the disparate tax treatment between debt and equity and refashioned the nation s international tax regime primarily for these reasons the tcja will enhance incentives for business investment in the united states a simple way to measure this effect is shown in the chart below the red line shows the contribution in percentage points of business investment to growth in gdp as measured by a 4 quarter moving average the clear need is for investment to surge and push up both the growth rate of the economy and investment s contribution to that growth how can we see if that is coming the blue line shows a 4 quarter moving average of new orders for capital goods which fairly closely tracks the investment it remains too early to evaluate completely the degree to which the tcja is boosting investment but there are clearly some promising indicators since the beginning of the current recovery and prior to the enactment of the tcja the average contribution of real business fixed investment to gdp growth was 0 6 percentage points but in the first four quarters after the tcja s passage the contribution of real business fixed investment to gdp growth rose to about 0 95 percentage points according to the economic report of the president overall private nonresidential fixed investment was up 150 billion 5 8 percent over recent trends since the enactment of the tcja trend through the third quarter of 2018 among nonfinancial businesses overall capital expenditures were up 12 1 percent over recent trends according to a research report compiled by morgan stanley and co plans for future capital expenditures reached an all time high not long after the enactment of the tcja this index was ticking up prior to the tcja enactment and has moderated somewhat since so its implications should not be overstated but this is an indicator to monitor for trends in investment behavior subsequent to the tcja s enactment there is also a burgeoning literature on the tcja s economic effects aptly summarized in the most recent economic report of the president one study by karel mertens of the dallas federal reserve finds that the cumulative effect on gdp between 2018 and 2020 of individual tax reform to be 0 5 percent and the cumulative effect of business tax reform to be 1 9 percent what is not a meaningful indicator for the tcja s effect on investment are stock buybacks the news is filled with reports that the tcja has spawned share buybacks corporations purchasing their own stock and opponents of the law have characterized this as evidence of failed policy a little reflection however indicates that share buybacks tell you essentially nothing about the success of the tcja as noted above investment is the channel through which the tcja will most meaningfully improve the u s economic growth outlook and standards of living critics argue that share buybacks are not investment in new inventions new business models or new equipment similarly they are not higher wages for workers taken to its logical conclusion this view regards share buybacks as a reflection of policy failure this reasoning is incomplete when firms repurchase their stock the dollars they pay do not disappear into a black hole the sellers could easily turn around and invest themselves indeed only about a fifth of corporate source earnings are distributed to taxable entities which means the vast majority of those earnings are going to things like pension funds whose incentive is to channel the dollars to the place with the highest return those firms doing the best investment in inventions business models and equipment this is precisely how markets should channel capital for productive investment in fact there could be many more intermediaries and many many links in the investment chain the bottom line is that success or failure is measured by the final transaction in that chain not the first as long as investment in the economy as a whole rises the tcja will have done its job as an aside it is probably a good thing when there are share buybacks they suggest that the firm has little in the way of high return investments to make it is far better to avoid having the dollars trapped in a low return firm and instead have them flow through financial markets to the best investment opportunities conclusion prior to the enactment of the tcja the u s tax code hadn t been overhauled in over 30 years the tax code was widely viewed as broken a conspicuous drag on the economy that chased u s firms overseas while suppressing investment here at home major elements of the tcja particularly the lower corporate tax rate expensing of qualified equipment and the broad architecture of the international reforms should improve the investment climate in the united states notes also see on which

have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and these non gaap financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures do not represent discretionary cash available to us to invest

adjustments from aligning an acquired company s revenue recognition policies to our policies we believe that our non gaap revenue measure helps management and investors understand our revenue trends and serves as a useful measure of ongoing business performance amortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets when we acquire an entity we are required under gaap to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the acquired entity and amortize those assets over their useful lives we exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets including acquired technology from our non gaap financial measures because they are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions we also exclude these amounts to provide easier comparability of pre and post acquisition operating results stock based compensation expenses we exclude stock based compensation expenses related to restricted stock awards stock bonus programs bonus share programs and other stock based awards from our non gaap financial measures we evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock based compensation is typically a non cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing size and nature of awards granted and is influenced in part by certain factors which are generally beyond our control such as the volatility of the price of our common stock in addition measurement of stock based compensation is subject to varying valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions and therefore we believe that excluding stock based compensation from our non gaap financial measures allows for meaningful comparisons of our current operating results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry unrealized gains and losses on certain derivatives net we exclude from our non gaap financial measures unrealized gains and losses on certain foreign currency derivatives which are not designated as hedges under accounting guidance we exclude unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives that serve as economic hedges against variability in the cash flows of recognized assets or liabilities or of forecasted transactions these contracts if designated as hedges under accounting guidance would be considered cash flow hedges these unrealized gains and losses are excluded from our non gaap financial measures because they are non cash transactions which are highly variable from period to period upon settlement of these foreign currency derivatives any realized gain or loss is included in our non gaap financial measures amortization of convertible note discount our non gaap financial measures exclude the amortization of the imputed discount on our convertible notes under gaap certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion are required to be bifurcated into separate liability debt and equity conversion option components in a manner that reflects the issuer s assumed non convertible debt borrowing rate for gaap purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the difference between our assumed non convertible debt borrowing rate and the coupon rate on our 400 0 million of 1 50 convertible notes this difference is excluded from our non gaap financial measures because we believe that this expense is based upon subjective assumptions and does not reflect the cash cost of our convertible debt losses and expenses on early retirements or modifications of debt we exclude from our non gaap financial measures losses on early retirements of debt attributable to refinancing or repaying our debt and expenses incurred to modify debt terms because we believe they are not reflective of our ongoing operations acquisition expenses net in connection with acquisition activity including with respect to acquisitions that are not consummated we incur expenses including legal accounting and other professional fees integration costs changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and other costs integration costs may consist of information technology expenses as systems are integrated across the combined entity consulting expenses marketing expenses and professional fees as well as non cash charges to write off or impair the value of redundant assets we exclude these expenses from our non gaap financial measures because they are unpredictable can vary based on the size and complexity of each transaction and are unrelated to our continuing operations or to the continuing operations of the acquired businesses restructuring expenses we exclude restructuring expenses from our non gaap financial measures which include employee termination costs facility exit costs certain professional fees asset impairment charges and other costs directly associated with resource realignments incurred in reaction to changing strategies or business conditions all of these costs can vary significantly in amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of our business and we believe that excluding them provides easier comparability of pre and post restructuring operating results impairment charges and other adjustments we exclude from our non gaap financial measures asset impairment charges other than those already included within restructuring or acquisition activity rent expense for redundant facilities gains or losses on sales of property gains or losses on settlements of certain legal matters and certain professional fees unrelated to our ongoing operations all of which are unusual in nature and can vary significantly in amount and frequency non gaap income tax adjustments we exclude our gaap provision benefit for income taxes from our non gaap measures of net income attributable to verint systems inc and instead include a non gaap provision for income taxes determined by applying a non gaap effective income tax rate to our income before provision for income taxes as adjusted for the non gaap items described above the non gaap effective income tax rate is generally based upon the income taxes we expect to pay in the reporting year our gaap effective income tax rate can vary significantly from year to year as a result of tax law changes settlements with tax authorities changes in the geographic mix of earnings including acquisition activity changes in the projected realizability of deferred tax assets and other unusual or period specific events all of which can vary in size and frequency we believe that our non gaap effective income tax rate removes much of this variability and facilitates meaningful comparisons of operating results across periods our non gaap effective income tax rate for the year ended january 31 2019 was 11 0 and was 11 5 for the year ended january 31 2018 we evaluate our non gaap effective income tax rate on an ongoing basis and it can change from time to time our non gaap income tax rate can differ materially from our gaap effective income tax rate customer engagement cloud and recurring revenue metrics recurring revenue on both a gaap and non gaap basis is the portion of our revenue that we believe is likely to be renewed in the future and primarily consists of initial and renewal post contract support saas subscription licenses and managed services which are recognized over time cloud revenue on both a gaap and non gaap basis primarily consists of saas subscription licenses and managed services which are recognized over time cloud annualized recurring revenue arr is calculated using gaap and non gaap cloud revenue excluding term based license revenue recognized in our most recently completed three month period on an annualized basis plus term based license gaap and non gaap revenue recognized during the most recent trailing 12 month period we believe that recurring revenue cloud revenue and cloud annualized recurring revenue provide investors with useful insight into the nature and sustainability of our revenue streams the recurrence of these revenue streams in future periods depends on a number of factors including contractual periods and customers renewal decisions please see revenue adjustments above for an explanation for why we present these revenue numbers on both a gaap and non gaap basis adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure defined as net income loss before interest expense interest income income taxes depreciation expense amortization expense revenue adjustments restructuring expenses acquisition expenses and other expenses excluded from our non gaap financial measures as described above we believe that adjusted ebitda is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between companies because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures income taxes stock based compensation accounting policies and depreciation and amortization policies adjusted ebitda is also used by credit rating agencies lenders and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness net debt net debt is a non gaap measure defined as the sum of long term and short term debt on our consolidated balance sheet excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs less the sum of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash restricted cash equivalents restricted bank time deposits and restricted investments including long term portions and short term investments we use this non gaap financial measure to help evaluate our capital structure financial leverage and our ability to reduce debt and to fund investing and financing activities and believe that it provides useful information to investors supplemental information about constant currency because we operate on a global basis and transact business in many currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our consolidated u s dollar operating results to facilitate the assessment of our performance excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculate our gaap and non gaap revenue cost of revenue and operating expenses on both an as reported basis and a constant currency basis allowing for comparison of results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant we perform our constant currency calculations by translating current period foreign currency results into u s dollars using prior period average foreign currency exchange rates or hedge rates as applicable rather than current period exchange rates we believe that constant currency measures which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends unless otherwise indicated our financial outlook for revenue operating margin and diluted earnings per share which is provided on a non gaap basis reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent with rates in effect when the outlook is provided we also incur foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency we periodically report our historical non gaap diluted net income per share both inclusive and exclusive of these net foreign exchange gains or losses our financial outlook for diluted earnings per share includes net foreign exchange gains or losses incurred to date if any but does not include potential future gains or losses
b2gold s directors have approved the expansion vancouver march 26 2019 cnw b2gold corp tsx bto nyse american btg nsx b2g b2gold or the company is pleased to announce very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine located in mali and that the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa all dollar figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated the expansion study pea was conducted to evaluate the life of mine lom options for expanded mining and processing to maximize the value of the substantially increased indicated and inferred mineral resource at the fekola mine see news release dated october 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production results of this study recommend an expansion of the existing plant to process an additional 1 5 mtpa resulting in a baseline capacity of 7 5 mtpa without requiring an additional ball mill or additional power generation capacity based on the new optimized mine plan the mining rate at fekola will also be increased along with additional mining equipment to accelerate the supply of higher grade ore to the expanded processing facilities as a result of the project and mineral resource expansion the fekola mine will produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous lom mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study preliminary economic assessment will be realized highlights of fekola expansion study pea assuming an effective date of january 1 2019 a gold price of 1 300 per ounce and a discount rate of 5 project economics highlights from the expansion study pea include estimated optimized lom extended into 2030 including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and over 400 000 ounces per year over the lom 2019 2030 projected gold production of approximately five million ounces over the new mine life of 12 years of mining and processing including 2019 prior to 2019 the fekola mine produced more than 550 000 ounces the fekola mineral resource remains open to the north a gold price of per ounce and a discount rate of 5 project economics highlights from the expansion study pea include an increase in project npv of approximately 500 million versus the comparable

forecast lom pre tax net cash flow of approximately 2 8 billion forecast lom pre tax net present value of over 2 2 billion revised projected lom cash operating cash costs see non ifrs measures and all in sustaining costs aisc see non ifrs measures remain low below 500 and 700 per ounce respectively despite mining a larger open pit at slightly lower gold grade this is due to economies of scale arising from increased mining and processing rates and the new optimized mining schedule during the five year period 2020 2024 under the new optimized lom aisc are expected to average approximately 630 per ounce and per ounce respectively despite mining a larger open pit at slightly lower gold grade this is due to economies of scale arising from increased mining and processing rates and the new optimized mining schedule during the five year period 2020 2024 under the new optimized lom aisc are expected to average approximately per ounce forecast expansion capital payback period of less than one year estimated processing plant expansion capital cost of approximately 50 million over a period of approximately 18 months for processing expansion and upgrades through q3 2020 half of this capital is expected to be spent in 2019 with the remaining half in 2020 it is anticipated that this will be financed from existing fekola mine cash flows over a period of approximately 18 months for processing expansion and upgrades through q3 2020 half of this capital is expected to be spent in 2019 with the remaining half in 2020 it is anticipated that this will be financed from existing fekola mine cash flows projected annual mining rate increased to a baseline of approximately 54 mtpa and subsequently stepped up to approximately 76 mtpa to support the increased processing and stockpiling necessary to maintain plant feed grade staged mining fleet additions totalling approximately 56 million over the lom are expected to be equipment loans lease financed over respective 5 year periods on terms similar to the existing fekola fleet loan lease terms projected annual processing rate increased to a baseline of 7 5 mtpa current capacity of 6 mtpa plus 1 5 mtpa ongoing drilling continues to infill the existing inferred mineral resources to indicated mineral resources mineralization remains open to the north and down plunge indicating the potential to further increase fekola mineral resources and reserves a large exploration drilling program will commence in q3 2019 to further test the fekola north cardinal and anaconda zones during the expansion study other upside opportunities were identified and are currently under review these will be incorporated into an updated fekola lom plan when related studies are complete and if they show an increase in overall project value upside opportunities identified to date include renewable energy focused on a solar plant alternative tailings storage co disposal paste dry stack and others waste mining various fleet options vs in pit crushing and conveying and the potential incorporation of material from the anaconda mineral resource basis of the study on october 25 2018 the company announced a substantial increase in the mineral resource for the fekola mine and positive results from the conceptual stage of the expansion study b2gold reported an indicated mineral resource of 92 8 million tonnes at a grade of 1 92 grams per tonne g t containing 5 73 million ounces and an inferred mineral resource of 26 5 million tonnes at a grade of 1 61 g t containing 1 37 million ounces see news release dated 10 25 2018 see also the company s current aif filed on sedar on march 20 2019 which reflects 2018 gold production this expanded resource coupled with positive results of an internal conceptual study formed the basis of and motivation for the expansion study pea mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability based on positive results of the conceptual fekola expansion study the company continued testing and design with the same lycopodium brisbane team which performed engineering and design work for the current fekola mill and infrastructure and contracted whittle consulting whittle to work together with the company s technical team to conduct an enterprise optimization study of the fekola project results have confirmed the value of the processing expansion and recommend a corresponding increase in mining capacity whittle evaluated mining production rates pit and phase scheduling dynamic cut off grades ore stockpiling blending and dynamic processing throughput and recovery to maximize project npv these parameters will continue to be optimized during the next phases of project design and implementation in the meantime the company is nearing completion on front end engineering and design feed for the expansion with a focus on long lead items the project schedule indicates that the processing expansion will be fully operational by q4 2020 b2gold is currently investigating the potential to accelerate this schedule based on the availability of long lead items as currently envisioned the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which will be commissioned in q3 2020 in parallel with the expansion b2gold is studying the addition of a solar power plant which would reduce operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions the current on site power plant has sufficient capacity to support the expanded processing throughput with or without the solar plant the current mining fleet consists of four caterpillar 6020b excavators with haul trucks drills and support equipment to match and mines an average of 36 mtpa the whittle results currently indicate that mining production rates ranging from 54 mtpa to 76 mtpa are optimal to support the expanded processing rates over the lom and optimize head grade during the period 2020 2024 increased production will be achieved with the addition of two to four excavators with corresponding trucks drills and support equipment large front end loaders would also be included to maintain fleet flexibility mine fleet expansion timing and scale will be optimized during q2 2019 and will generally be equipment loan lease financed over a five year period the study has included 28 million for expansion to 54 mtpa and an additional 28 million for a total of 56 million to go to 76 mtpa in parallel with the whittle study b2gold is reviewing in pit crushing and conveying as a means to reduce operating costs and potentially implement tailings and waste co disposal at the fekola mine b2gold is also considering the option of transporting the nearby anaconda saprolite material to fekola for processing see news release dated 06 15 2017 with the combination of the increased indicated and inferred mineral resource and implementation of the processing expansion and mining expansion the fekola mine will see a substantial increase in annual and lom gold production and revenues revised lom cash operating cash costs and aisc are estimated at below 500 and 700 per ounce respectively despite mining a larger open pit at slightly lower gold grade under the pea low costs are forecast to be maintained through the new extended fekola mine life due to economies of scale arising from increased mining and processing rates and the optimized mining schedule during the five year period 2020 2024 under the new optimized lom aisc are expected to average approximately 630 per ounce current pea expansion estimates indicate approximate annual gold production averaging over 400 000 ounces per year over the new lom including 2019 with over 550 000 ounces per year over the five year period 2020 2024 total processed tonnage currently included in the expansion study pea consists of approximately 84 million tonnes processed over the lom period 2019 2030 at a grade of 1 9 g t producing approximately 5 0 million ounces prior to 2019 the fekola mine produced more than 550 000 ounces from its operations since inception the fekola resources remain open to the north and down plunge head grade may be optimized to an average of up to 2 3 g t over the period 2020 2024 with an increased mining rate and ore stockpiling under the current expansion study pea assumptions mine life extends to 12 years including 2019 into 2030 even with the increased processing rate of 7 5 mtpa mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability upside potential b2gold s technical team along with lycopodium whittle consulting and others continues to study and optimize several components of the fekola mine ongoing studies include optimizing the mine production schedule and stockpile strategy adding solar power reviewing various tailings and waste disposal strategies and the potential to process material from the anaconda project located to the north through the fekola plant these studies will continue through q2 2019 and will be incorporated into a revised fekola lom plan which is expected to be available by the end of q1 2020 since january 2019 up to seven drill rigs have completed 27 drill holes focussed on infill drilling the inferred portion of the new fekola mineral resource 21 to indicated so that an updated geologic and grade model can be completed in late 2019 this will allow the engineering group to complete an updated design pit and new mineral reserves along with an updated fekola lom plan by the end of q1 2020 once infill drilling is completed at the end of q2 2019 b2gold plans to immediately dedicate exploration drill rigs to test several targets with the potential to expand the mineral resources these targets include the fekola north area beyond the current resource boundary that remains open along strike and down plunge the cardinal structures west of the operating mine and the fekola south area where previous wide spaced drilling has shown potential for additional mineralization below the main fekola orebody in addition in early q3 drill rigs will be mobilized to the anaconda region to continue efforts to expand the previously announced shallow saprolite resource as well as further tests for hard rock mineralization targets below the saprolite resource about b2gold corp headquartered in vancouver canada b2gold corp is the world s new senior gold producer founded in 2007 today b2gold has five operating gold mines and numerous exploration and development projects in various countries including nicaragua the philippines namibia mali burkina faso and colombia b2gold will

differs significantly from the current requirements of the sec set out in industry guide 7 accordingly such disclosure may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report in accordance with industry guide 7 in particular this news release may refer to mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources while these categories of mineralization are recognized and required by canadian securities laws they are not recognized by industry guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be disclosed in sec filings by u s companies u s investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of a mineral resource indicated mineral resource or inferred mineral resource will ever be converted into a reserve in addition this news release uses the terms reserves and mineral reserves which are reported by the company under canadian standards and may not qualify as reserves under industry guide 7 under industry guide 7 mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the mineralization can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the reserve determination is made accordingly information contained or referenced in this news release containing descriptions of the company s mineral deposits may not be compatible to similar information made public by u s companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of industry guide 7 inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category further while ni 43 101 permits companies to disclose economic projections contained in preliminary economic assessments and pre feasibility studies which are not based on reserves u s companies have not generally been permitted to disclose economic projections for a mineral property in their sec filings prior to the establishment of reserves disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian reporting standards however industry guide 7 normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves by industry guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures historical results or

it is critically important to the success of a due diligence investigation that the seller establish maintain and update as appropriate a well organized online data room to enable the buyer to conduct due diligence in an orderly fashion such electronic data sites are customary today the following are the common attributes and characteristics of an effective data room the seller makes it available to the buyer as early in the process as possible at the latest immediately following the parties finalizing the letter of intent or term sheet the data room has a logical table of contents or directory and full text search capabilities which requires scanning of all documents with optical character recognition software the data room permits bookmarking within the application subject to confidentiality concerns the buyer is permitted to print documents for offline review the data room is keyed to any due diligence checklist including updates provided by the buyer to facilitate cross referencing and review ideally access to the data room is accompanied by delivery by the seller to the buyer of a draft disclosure schedule and all materials referred to in the disclosure schedule are in the data room updates to the data room are clearly marked or trigger email notifications to the buyer s counsel to help ensure that nothing is missed as supplemental materials are added during the

representations and warranties in the acquisition agreement careful preparation of this disclosure schedule is extremely important and time consuming for the seller the seller s management needs to be deeply involved in the drafting of the disclosure schedule this document is not simply a legal document to be left to the lawyers to prepare the seller also must anticipate that the buyer and its legal and financial advisors will negotiate the wording of the disclosure schedule accordingly it is not unusual for the seller to have to revise and update its disclosure schedule a number of times before it is either ready for delivery to the buyer or it is finalized that means that it is essential for the seller to begin preparing the disclosure schedule very early in the planning stages of an m a transaction and to devote sufficient resources to this document to ensure that it is accurate and complete when the acquisition agreement is signed particularly since in most cases the seller has no right to update the disclosure schedule after signing and prior to closing the buyer and its counsel will be looking for the following in the disclosure schedule among many other items does the disclosure schedule accurately tie to the representations and warranties set forth in the acquisition agreement does the disclosure only modify the relevant representations and warranties are all material contracts and amendments listed with dates and counterparties are all contracts listed in the disclosure schedule contained in the target s online data room and have those contracts been reviewed have all patents issued and pending been summarized and listed are any important contracts affected by a change in control will consents be obtained from the counterparty before or after the change in control if litigation is listed has an analysis been done of the potential exposure if there are liens on any assets how will those liens be removed at closing has the buyer identified any liens not shown in the disclosure schedule are there any unusual employment agreements or severance arrangements is the outstanding capital stock options and warrants of the seller properly listed do the seller s continuing contracts provide for any issues for the seller moving forward are there any material matters set forth in the disclosure schedule that are inconsistent with statements previously made on behalf of the seller or with the valuation that the buyer has placed on the business being acquired does the disclosure schedule include any broad disclaimers or generalized disclosures that would prevent the buyer from raising legitimate claims following the closing if individual representations and warranties turned out to be untrue are there disclosures or statements in the disclosure schedule that are internally inconsistent with each other should the buyer demand indemnity for any specific liabilities disclosed in the disclosure schedule for more information

traders amped up bets on federal reserve interest rate cuts this year and treasuries surged as investors around the world sought the safety of bonds amid increasing concern about a slowdown in global growth fed funds futures are now pricing in more than 30 basis points of easing by the end of 2019 suggesting at least one quarter point cut and possibly more benchmark 10 year yields tumbled to their lowest level since december 2017 touching 2 35 percent a surprise move by new zealand s central bank to signal that its next shift would likely be a cut also stoked gains in global bonds meanwhile germany s benchmark yield slid further below zero after the nation sold 10 year notes at a negative rate for the first time since 2016 there are lingering concerns about the growth prospects in the u s said alex li head of u s rates strategy at credit agricole sa investors mindset has changed after the fed last week revised their growth forecasts and removed all the rate hike dots for 2019 given benchmark 10 year yields have now broken below a range that had held since the start of the year li is advising investors to step to the sidelines and not try to fight the current trend money market traders continue to extend the amount of fed easing they foresee this year predicting the central bank will reverse course on policy even as officials have signaled only that they ll stand pat on rates the implied rate on fed funds futures that expire in january 2020 has fallen from 2 14 percent on tuesday to 2 09 percent that compares to the overnight benchmark targeted by the fed which currently stands at 2 40 percent and implies more than one full cut is priced in for this year one potential policy maker who appears willing to push toward easing is stephen moore who u s president donald trump may nominate for a seat on the federal reserve board he told the new york times in an interview that the central bank should immediately reverse course and lower interest rates by half a percentage point monetary policy in europe appears poised to support global debt as well european central bank president mario draghi said the risks to the euro area are tilted to the downside while any pickup in inflation is delayed the race to the bottom continues for government bond yields fawad razaqzada a technical analyst at forex com wrote in a note central banks have turned dovish in recent months owing to evidence of a slowing global economy haven demand was also spurred by some concerns in emerging markets with the turkish lira plunging as traders grappled with the government s curbs on trading the currency developing market stocks slipped although u s and european shares managed to eke out small gains the next significant test for the treasury market is set to be wednesday s auctions the government is planning to sell 18 billion of notes in a reopening of its two year floating rate security and 41 billion of five year debt the sale of 2024 securities will be of particular interest given the recent outperformance of that part of the curve generally referred to as the belly the speed of the decline in u s treasury yields has also been fueled by a wave of mortgage related hedging in the swaps market said credit agricole s li that s because a fall in financing costs likely sparked more people to refinance their mortgages cutting mortgage bond holders duration the yield on 10 year treasuries was 2 36 percent at 10 47 a m in new york down six basis points from its close tuesday yields on 10 year bunds fell seven basis points to around minus 0 08 percent marty mitchell an independent strategist wrote in his daily newsletter to clients said that increasing amounts of negatively yielding bonds outside america have been supportive of the u s market and there are also haven flows into treasuries mitchell recommended clients continue to buy the dips in treasury prices and noted downside yield support comes in at 2 34 percent 2 32 percent and 2 30 percent binky chadha a strategist at deutsche bank ag has indicated that the move in yields and rate cut bets may have its limits and could even reverse further declines in the 10 year require pricing in of more rate cuts but since 2014 the market has been hesitant to price more than 1 rate move by the fed in either direction chadha wrote in a note in the absence of very negative data or worsening of any of the long list of well known risks the market is unlikely to take a strong view on further rate cuts and this argues for a v shaped move in the 10 year a closely watched segment of the u s yield curve that s often seen as a harbinger of recession when it flips moved further into inversion the 3 month rate last week dipped underneath the 10 year yield for the first time in more than a decade and on wednesday it fell to as much as 11 basis points below in the lead up to the economic downturn that began in december 2007 this part of the curve initially went negative about 23 months before the recession started helping drive long term yields lower and invert the curve is investors growing belief that central banks will quickly step in beyond just cutting rates and support the economy if things look dire including buying more bonds market participants believe that if we were to go into a recession the reaction function could be that quantitative easing programs begin again with central banks going into long duration bonds said thomas wacker head of credit in the chief investment office of ubs global wealth management which oversees about 2 trillion the fed announced last week that it would end its balance sheet run off beginning in october sooner than most strategists had predicted there s little standing in the way of lower treasury yields the rest of this month according to jim vogel a strategist at ftn financial the last five days now is largest volume period of 2019 setting up still more volatility next week as fresh data make their appearance vogel wrote in a note
michael spence a nobel laureate in economics is professor of economics at new york university s stern school of business and senior fellow at the hoover institution open this photo in gallery anti brexit supporters take part in a protest outside the house of parliament in london on march 12 2019 tim ireland the associated press the global economy is weakening in no small measure because of a deep widespread sense of uncertainty and a major source of that uncertainty is the continuing sino american trade war as lawrence lau of stanford university has shown the problem is not that tit for tat tariffs have had an especially large impact except perhaps on particular u s and chinese economic sectors rather the conflict has cast doubt on the future of global economic connectivity which has led to lower investment and consumption in china and the united states and among their respective trading partners moreover the chinese state has expanded its role in the economy state owned enterprises soes are back in favour among young job seekers and in the eyes of the largely state owned banking sector even though many soes really should be restructured rather than kept afloat at the same time many private sector firms are finding credit scarce and very expensive and bankruptcies appear to be on the rise periodic policy interventions to reverse these longstanding public private asymmetries have proved insufficient as for the united states the economy is coming down from a pro cyclical fiscal stimulus that was bound to leave a mild hangover and until very recently the u s federal reserve has been tightening monetary policy with the effects of higher interest rates probably delayed by the trump administration s december 2017 tax cuts meanwhile according to a recent council on foreign relations report jobs in manufacturing construction and mining have become relatively scarce while unfilled openings in a range of higher productivity service industries are increasing more generally productivity growth has been trending downward undercutting long term growth a mckinsey global institute report notes that this trend is partly owing to lags in the implementation of new digital technologies another factor is the growing skills mismatch which has also contributed to labour immobility between traditional blue collar jobs and services political developments are adding to the uncertainty in the united states no one knows if the 2020 presidential election will result in a second term for donald trump or a new democratic administration governing from either the centre or the far left the range of possible policy scenarios from antitrust actions against major digital platforms to universal health care schemes and major changes in the tax system is more expansive than it has been in decades the situation in europe is not very different with nationalism and populism of the left and right on the rise anti establishment parties have either gained ground or taken power in many countries in light of these developments the european union seems increasingly unlikely to undertake sorely needed structural reforms the only two leaders who could push through such measures german chancellor angela merkel and french president emmanuel macron have been weakened politically ms merkel has announced that this term will be her last and mr macron has had to contend with widespread and in many cases violent protests since november come may all eyes will be on the european parliament elections which could result in a radical reshuffling of staff at the european council and commission and complicating matters further britain has fallen down the rabbit hole of brexit adding to the climate of uncertainty on the economic front germany s troubles owing to its sizable industrial sector and significant exposure to developments in china have had spillover effects across europe italy remains in a two decade period of subdued growth with youth unemployment at an intolerably high 32 per cent worse the italian government has taken a confrontational approach to the eu over fiscal rules but lacks a convincing plan to achieve long term growth with italian sovereign debt having ticked back up toward 140 per cent of gdp there is reason to worry that a spike in yields for government bonds as happened in 2010 12 could provoke a fiscal crisis should that happen it is unclear how the european central bank would respond in any case the absence of strong growth will add to the fragility of the italian banking sector as non performing loans tend to rise with growth headwinds that in turn will result in tighter credit and damage to still healthy sectors of the italian economy more broadly europe is lagging behind other powers in terms of innovation and the adoption of new digital technologies but digital technologies themselves are also contributing to global uncertainty the extent to which digital platforms can influence political processes is unclear but there is ample evidence to suggest that they have amplified social fault lines and made democratic elections easier to exploit beneath those fault lines are powerful economic trends not least the labour market and income polarization that is observable across the developed economies the global economy is undergoing a major transition owing to the rise of emerging economies especially in asia and the digital transformation of business models and global supply chains services constitute a growing share of global trade and the search is on for new sources of comparative advantage the location of final markets and the configuration of supply chains are in flux or being upended entirely and while it is obvious that global governance structures and rules need an overhaul existing international institutions lack the power to push through such changes on their own and the governments of the world s leading economic powers do not seem up to the task taken together these diverse economic and political trends may or may not lead to another global crisis or sudden stop either way they will sustain a prolonged period of radical uncertainty under such conditions caution may seem like the best policy for companies investors consumers and even governments but caution carries its own costs companies and countries that fail to invest enough in for example new digital technologies may well fall by the wayside and as long as the rules and institutions governing the global economy remain in doubt continued underperformance is to be expected

senator elizabeth warren is pushing a wealth tax plan on the presidential campaign trail she is promising that her tax would counter a rigged political system and raise enough money to pay for universal child care a green new deal student loan relief medicare for all and more housing subsidies warren s tax would be an annual levy of 2 percent on net wealth meaning wealth minus debt above 50 million and 3 percent on net wealth above 1 billion wealth tax supporters do not seem concerned about the likely damage to economic growth but they should know that from a practical standpoint wealth taxes in other countries have raised little money and have been a beast to administer more than a dozen european countries used to have wealth taxes but nearly all of these countries repealed them including austria denmark finland france germany iceland ireland italy the netherlands luxembourg and sweden wealth taxes survive only in norway spain and switzerland before repeal european wealth taxes with a variety of rates and bases tended to raise only about 0 2 percent of gross domestic product in revenue based on organization for economic cooperation and development data that is only 1 40th as much as the u s federal income tax raises yet for little revenue wealth taxes are difficult to administer and enforce they may require taxpayers to report the values of financial securities homes furniture artwork jewelry antiques vehicles boats pension rights family businesses farm assets land intellectual property and much else but owners do not know the market values of many assets and values change over time so costly wealth tax compliance would only make accountants wealthy and what about wealth held abroad there is no way the internal revenue service would be able to track down and value everything u s residents owned on a global basis in the 1970s the british labour government pushed for a national wealth tax and failed the minister in charge denis healey said in his memoirs we had committed ourselves to a wealth tax but in five years i found it impossible to draft one which would yield enough revenue to be worth the administrative cost and political hassle another problem is that wealth taxes have disappearing tax bases in europe politicians carved out an increasing number of exemptions from tax bases to appease special interests exemptions were often provided for farm assets small businesses pension assets artwork and other items and here s the kicker since the base of wealth taxes is net wealth debt is deductible that allowed wealthy europeans to jack up their borrowing and invest in the exempted assets to shrink their tax bases if a wealth tax were imposed in the united states the farm lobby would most certainly get farmland excluded then rich people would borrow heavily and invest in farmland thus shrinking the tax base and distorting the economy magnus henrekson and gunnar du rietz studied the history of the swedish wealth tax they found that people could with impunity evade the tax by taking appropriate measures including taking on excessive debt to buy exempted assets the swedish wealth tax also prompted large outflows of capital and the expatriation of well known business people such as the founder of ikea ingvar kamprad henrekson and du rietz conclude the magnitude of these outflows was a major motivation for the repeal of the wealth tax in 2007 it was the same story with the french wealth tax which was imposed in 1982 and repealed in 2017 over the years a parade of french businesspeople and celebrities left the country to avoid the tax many going to belgium which is also a high tax country but has no wealth tax the government estimated in 2017 that some 10 000 people with 35 billion euros worth of assets left in the past 15 years for tax reasons french economist eric pichet estimated that the outflows were much larger as the wealthy moved abroad the government lost revenues from a range of other taxes they would have paid pichet calculated that while the wealth tax raised about 3 5 billion euros a year the government lost 7 billion euros a year from reductions in other taxes in a 2018 article for the international monetary fund economists james brumby and michael keen conclude the design of wealth taxes is notoriously prone to lobbying and the granting of exemptions that the wealthiest can exploit furthermore the rich have proved adept avoiding or evading taxes by placing their wealth abroad in low tax jurisdictions senator warren and other liberals rightly denounce cronyism and tax avoidance by the rich but a wealth tax would generate more of those ills if warren s plan were enacted the rich would descend on congress to lobby for exemptions while cranking up debt and hiding their taxable assets here and abroad if liberals want tax fairness they should push to close existing income tax loopholes the tax exemption for municipal bond interest for example would be a good target because it mainly benefits the wealthy closing such loopholes would reduce distortions and simplify taxation the exact opposite effects of adding a wealth tax more from national review
macroprudential analysis of residential real estate markets prepared by marco lo duca mara pirovano marek rusnák and eugen tereanu this article presents the ecb framework for assessing financial stability risks stemming from residential real estate markets and for designing macroprudential policy responses it reviews recent developments in residential real estate markets and policy initiatives to address risks 1 introduction developments in the residential real estate rre sector can have strong repercussions on financial stability and the real economy the importance of the residential real estate sector for financial stability stems from its central role in the economy the large fraction of household wealth invested in real estate assets the primary role of the financial sector in financing real estate investments and the important collateral role of real estate assets the identification and monitoring of rre market risks to financial stability as well as the design of commensurate macro prudential policies is a priority for macroprudential authorities including the ecb the ecb is a constituent part of the eu institutional framework for macroprudential oversight specifically under council regulation eu no 1024 2013 the ssm regulation the ecb is responsible for assessing macroprudential measures adopted by national authorities in the countries subject to european banking supervision the ecb also has the power to apply if deemed necessary more stringent measures than those adopted nationally acting on its own initiative or at the request of national authorities more generally the ecb has responsibilities for the coordination and co shaping of macroprudential policies in the euro area given the economic and policy implications of rre markets this article discusses the relevant framework for risk and policy analysis applied by the ecb and highlights the key messages of its current rre risk and policy assessment 2 macroprudential risk and policy framework for residential real estate markets this section briefly presents a framework for macroprudential risk and policy analysis of residential real estate markets this framework relies on experience gained in cooperation with the esrb 2016 and current initiatives within the euro area and beyond 2 1 the framework for risk analysis the ecb uses a range of indicators to assess residential real estate risks from a macroprudential perspective such indicators have been identified as good leading indicators of emerging vulnerabilities preceding residential real estate downturns similarly to the esrb 2016 core indicators are grouped into three main categories or stretches which capture different sources of residential real estate risks this core set of indicators is complemented by other information encompassing linkages with the financial sector and structural features of real estate markets which might amplify adverse shocks indicators in the collateral stretch inform risks stemming from unsustainable price developments exuberant price dynamics and misalignments could signal the formation of price bubbles early on which could lead to financial instability and deep recessions within the collateral stretch the ecb monitors measures of house price dynamics and different valuation measures indicators in the funding stretch help to identify risks stemming from unsustainable lending developments exuberant lending contributes to real estate price bubbles and makes bubble bursts more costly furthermore the deterioration of credit standards might lead to fragilities in bank balance sheets which could amplify financial instability within the funding stretch the ecb monitors indicators capturing the dynamics of mortgage loans measures of loan pricing and credit standards indicators in the household stretch help to detect fragilities in household balance sheets empirical evidence suggests that when households are highly indebted housing busts are more likely to be associated with longer and more costly recessions indicators monitored by the ecb include the level of household debt in relation to disposable income household financial assets in relation to debt a mitigating factor and the aggregate debt service to income ratio table 1 residential real estate scoreboard an input to the risk identification process source ecb and ecb computations notes each cell of the scoreboard reports the latest available value of the respective indicator colour coding a discrete rating with four categories is applied to each indicator based on whether the indicator value exceeds certain indicative threshold values the threshold values which are reported in the lower part of the table low medium and high are based on early warning model thresholds and or the views of experts after checking the overall distribution of the indicator across time and countries the colour coding relates to the intensity of risk signals as follows no colour no signal yellow low intensity signal low threshold breached orange medium intensity signal medium threshold breached red high intensity signal high threshold breached last observation for pricing indicators was q3 2018 except for be q1 2018 and cy and fi q2 2018 last observation for lending indicators was q4 2018 last observation for household balance sheet indicators was q3 2018 except for cy ee lt lu lv and sk q4 2017 and mt q2 2017 in the case of hh debt and except for at be de es fi fr gr ie it lu nl and pt q2 2018 in the case of debt service to income ratio for hh key indicators for the three stretches are presented in the scoreboard above see table 1 the latter consists of a heat map where each indicator is evaluated against a set of thresholds guided in turn by model based evidence using the ecb esrb crisis database and or by the cross time and cross country distributions of the indicators the risk assessment also considers other information on links between real estate markets and the financial sector which could amplify adverse shocks additional risk information encompasses indicators related to a the size of the rre market in a country b the exposure of banks to rre c potential supply shocks e g deleveraging and d the importance of the collateral channel furthermore analysing the exposure of banks to the construction sector is important in order to assess concentration and potential solvency risks as the dynamic of the construction sector is intertwined with that of rre particularly during downturns finally household housing wealth is assessed to inform the negative impact on consumer spending following a sudden downturn in house prices country specific and structural features are also considered in view of the wide heterogeneity of the domestic residential real estate markets across euro area countries the most important structural and institutional features include rre market characteristics home ownership rate typical maturity and fixation of housing loans rental market restrictions tax policy and transaction costs further supply side characteristics price elasticity of new housing regulation and spatial planning as well as demand side factors demographics and changes in household structures are important drivers of housing markets nonetheless the impact of certain structural features in rre markets on financial stability is not clear ex ante to facilitate the policy discussion risk signals from the indicators are distinguished along stock and flow dimensions for example stock vulnerabilities signalled by high household indebtedness and or house price overvaluations indicate the need to increase resilience of lenders flow vulnerabilities related to increasing indebtedness and or deteriorating lending standards associated with excessive credit growth call for the activation of policies to tame the cycle or to contain the accumulation of vulnerabilities 2 2 the framework for policy analysis macroprudential policies to address real estate risks encompass two main categories capital based and borrower based measures capital measures require banks to hold more capital against real estate exposures borrower based measures consist of the imposition of limits to the volume of credit a borrower can obtain the legal framework for the implementation of capital based instruments is harmonised across the eu while borrower based instruments are based on national legislation and are not harmonised across the eu the framework for capital measures is provided by the capital requirements directive crd iv and the capital requirements regulation crr examples of capital based macroprudential instruments to address real estate related risks encompass higher risk weights for real estate exposures article 124 crr and higher floors on banks loss given default article 164 crr additional capital requirements for real estate exposures applying to all or a subset of domestic financial institutions may also be introduced via article 458 crr the legal basis for the macroprudential mandate of the ecb is provided by council regulation eu no 1024 2013 the ssm regulation in general the ecb and national authorities share a macroprudential mandate in that the ecb can top up selected national macroprudential measures primarily related to capital instruments while borrower based instruments are the remit of national authorities where applicable the ecb can act on its own authority as well as at the request of national authorities the choice of implementing one or a combination of macroprudential instruments crucially depends on the nature of the identified real estate vulnerabilities and on the specific policy objectives table 2 in general macroprudential policy is used to strengthen the resilience of borrowers and lenders against the consequences of risks materialising as well as to counter the build up of these risks thereby lowering the probability of their materialisation however due to their characteristics different instruments are particularly suited to target specific objectives capital based instruments are most suited to address risks stemming from stock vulnerabilities such as for instance high levels of household indebtedness or overvalued real estate prices by requiring banks to hold more capital against the outstanding stock of real estate exposures capital based measures ensure that adequate buffers are in place to absorb losses on banks mortgage loan portfolios in case of adverse developments furthermore additional capital requirements help to ensure the smooth provision of credit even during downturns thereby mitigating the impact of crises on the broader economy borrower based instruments are best suited to address flow vulnerabilities stemming for example from excessive credit growth deteriorating credit standards and increasing household indebtedness by curtailing the new loan amount borrower based instruments such as limits to ltv dti and dsti ratios restrain the growth of credit and that of household indebtedness in addition to increasing households resilience to adverse income and interest rate shocks furthermore borrower based instruments improve the quality of banks mortgage loan portfolios by encouraging prudent lending standards which gradually make loan portfolios less risky over time table 2 linking macroprudential instruments to vulnerabilities and policy objectives source ecb notes collateral stretch vulnerabilities relate to unsustainable price developments funding stretch vulnerabilities are related to unsustainable lending developments and household stretch vulnerabilities relate to fragilities in household balance sheets the design and calibration of macroprudential instruments are crucial to ensure that they achieve the policy objectives the level at which instruments are calibrated determines the strength of the effect on the key target variables other policies influence the design and calibration of macroprudential instruments to address residential real estate risks the effects of monetary and fiscal policies on variables representing key macroprudential objectives should be taken into account when deciding to activate macroprudential instruments microprudential instruments affecting individual banks may also be used to address institution specific risks related to real estate exposures this interaction demands close cooperation between micro and macroprudential authorities finally other macroprudential instruments designed to counter broader based vulnerabilities can also impact the real estate sector capital based instruments such as the countercyclical capital buffer ccyb and the systemic risk buffer srb may also help to counter the build up of real estate vulnerabilities 3 current developments in residential real estate markets and policy responses the residential real estate cycle across the euro area has been gaining momentum in recent years the acceleration of the growth of residential house prices has been steady since the recovery in euro area housing markets started in mid 2014 chart 1 nominal rre price annual growth reached 4 3 in 2018 q3 2 2 in real terms which is not far from annual growth rates recorded in the period 2003 2006 before the global financial crisis the robust price dynamics are contributing to some signs of overvaluation the nominal rre price index is currently 8 7 p p higher than the pre crisis peak in q3 2008 prices increased faster than the disposable income resulting in a slight deviation of the house price to income ratio from its long term average 6 p p in q3 2018 a model based assessment also points to slight overvaluation 1 2 p p in

average of valuation measures based on price to income ratio price to rent ratio asset pricing approach and valuation based on the econometric model estimates although mortgage loan growth remains moderate strong loan origination and signs of easing lending standards call for close monitoring of credit developments mortgage lending growth remains moderate in nominal and real terms 3 3 and 1 3 y o y growth in q4 2018 respectively chart 3 nonetheless these net loan growth figures are dampened by loan repayments resulting from the boom period in mortgage markets before the crisis in contrast loan origination i e new bank loans dynamics appear to be stronger in line with figures observed in the period 2004 and 2005 against this background lending terms should be monitored closely also in view of emerging evidence of a progressive easing of loan lending standards for house purchases since q1 2017 as indicated by the ecb bank lending survey bls the trend decline in household indebtedness in the euro area appears to have halted and the debt to income ratio is hovering around the still relatively high level of 95 chart 3 in addition households in countries where floating rate contracts are prevalent might be exposed to interest rate risks against the backdrop of the recovery in residential real estate markets gaining momentum a number of policy recommendations apply across euro area countries national authorities should closely monitor lending standards on mortgage loans to ensure that banks apply sound lending practices to this end it is important that granular data are made available to policy makers in line with the esrb recommendation 2016 14 on closing real estate data gaps to prevent the deterioration of lending standards national authorities could provide guidance to banks on prudent lending practices and require banks to test long term debt affordability at loan origination with a focus on interest rate risk this would ensure that loans will continue to perform in a scenario of rising interest rates finally national authorities should stand ready to activate borrower based measures to this end a comprehensive legislative framework for borrower based measures should be available to policy makers chart 2 loans to households for house purchase new loans and household debt percentage of disposable income annual percentage change

measures in the form of higher risk weights on mortgage exposures and diverse mixes of borrower based measures policies appear commensurate to existing risks in a number of countries but further policy actions may be warranted in others whenever possible the impact of enacted policies should be assessed as a matter of priority at the same time the continuation of risk build up in residential real estate markets in some countries should be carefully monitored as it could require further policy interventions in the near future chart 3 stock vulnerabilities and capital measures yellow

national authorities notes as of 31 january 2019 the measures in austria are in the form of recommendations the measures are adopted by banco de portugal as a recommendation based on the comply or explain principle the sign indicates the exemption speed limit the percentage of new loans that can be granted above the limit of the lending standard national specific measures are not always comparable given different definitions of loans value collateral and or income the limit in finland is on loan to collateral ltc rather than loan to value ltv a maximum percentage of the value of new lending is allowed above the ltv limit 5 per cent for first time buyers 20 per cent for second and subsequent buyers 10 per cent for buy to let borrowers from january 2018 up to 20 per cent of the value of new lending to first time buyers and 10 per cent of the value of new lending to second and subsequent buyers will be permitted to be above the 3 5 lti limit in the case of floating or mixed interest rate agreements the impact of an interest rate rise is considered the dsti computation takes into account a reduction of the borrower s income if at the planned expiry of the agreement the borrower is aged 70 or over for maturity there is gradual convergence towards an average maturity of 30 years by the end of 2022 up to 25 of the value of new lending is allowed with ltv 80 this allowance will be phased down as follows 20 as of 1 7 2019 up to 10 of the value of new lending is allowed above the dti limit for dti the allowance of 10 will be phased down as follows 5 5 with additional conditions as of 1 7 2019 4 conclusion the strong linkages between residential real estate rre the financial sector and the overall economy have been brought to the fore in particular since the last global financial crisis therefore an essential component of the financial stability surveillance and macroprudential policy mandate of the ecb is the application of a robust and comprehensive rre risk detection and policy framework this article describes the key features of the ecb framework used to identify vulnerabilities in residential real estate markets and guide the appropriate macroprudential policy response and dialogue beyond regular analysis the framework forms the basis for the macroprudential dialogue with national authorities thereby facilitating a common understanding of risk developments and a more efficient policy process the current analysis indicates that residential real estate vulnerabilities relevant to macroprudential policy are present in a number of euro area countries in general the activation over the past years of macroprudential instruments related to residential real estate risks recognises the need for a proactive policy stance to avoid possible negative consequences for the financial sector and the broader economy however the continuation of observed trends in residential real estate markets in some countries suggests that

seth rogen team up on cannabis brand from today s globe and mail debt and wealth a new study from statistics canada shows just how wealthy we are as a nation but it also highlights how many canadians are messed up or poor the report by principal researcher guy gellatly and senior research economist elizabeth richards released this week comes amid the continuing controversy over income inequality in canada and is certain to feed into the debate their study illustrates how wealth has increased markedly and how debt to income levels in victoria vancouver and toronto are out of whack with the rest of canada and notably how 8 4 per cent of families have less than 500 in net worth some of the numbers may be a bit out of date given that they re taken largely from a 2016 survey of financial security and of course given the change in borrowing habits since interest rates first rose and new mortgage qualification stress tests came into effect early last year but the researchers also took information from other statistics canada sources to include the most up to date results ms richards said the numbers shed light on debt and wealth across canadian regions and income groups and show changes over time and remember although our borrowing habits may have cooled along with housing markets credit levels remain swollen and the household debt burden elevated among their findings debt debt to income levels among canadian households continued to edge higher in the years following the recession before rising sharply in 2015 and 2016 when income growth slowed as the economy adjusted to lower oil prices mr gellatly and ms richards said currently canadian debt to income levels are over 20 per cent higher than in late 2007 the debt to income ratios of households in victoria vancouver and toronto stood at 240 per cent 230 per cent and 210 per cent respectively in 2016 topping the national average of 165 per cent for purposes of comparison those in moncton london and

estimates reported above highlight the extent to which many lower income families carry on average both higher debt loads and lower levels of net wealth the statistics canada researchers said households in the lowest income quintiles in toronto had a sharp 420 per cent of debt as a proportion of income in vancouver that stood at 400 per cent thus the study underscores how it was the poorest households in the nation s two largest cities that were squeezed the most said bank of montreal economic analyst priscilla thiagamoorthy we suspect the bulk of the debt was likely from student assistance programs auto loans and credit cards she said the good news is that interest rate hikes are now on pause and job gains are a bright spot in the canadian economy but if we see major signs of teetering on that front the debt burden could become a larger issue the latest numbers from statistics canada for the record showed household credit market debt to disposable income at a seasonally adjusted 178 5 per cent in the fourth quarter which means we owe 1 79 for each dollar of disposable income wealth median net worth surged to 295 000 in 2016 from 144 500 in 1999 driven by families in toronto and vancouver where such net worth rose 121 per cent to 365 100 and 188 per cent to 434 400 respectively despite significantly higher debt levels those at the lowest end of the income distribution also generally had lower net worth particularly compared with those in the higher income quintiles statistics canada said for example in toronto net worth for families in the lowest income quintile was 9 000 in 2016 compared with 1 2 million for those in the highest income quintile this finding was generally similar across the country breaking it down families in every income

this is a preview of the spring issue of the american prospect magazine subscribe here the day before valentine s day the house financial services committee convened its first hearing of the 116th congress for the prior eight years when republicans controlled the house hearings were typically reserved for the majority s demands that wall street be relieved from the shackles of regulation proposed deregulatory changes were deliberately buried under technical jargon impenetrable to the average american so almost nobody outside the financial industry would comprehend the committee s giveaways but that was then this year maxine waters d ca who assumed the chair after the democratic midterm triumph signaled a break with that past with her first hearing topic homelessness in america in the richest country in the world it is simply unacceptable that we have people living in the streets waters said in her opening statement noting that over 550 000 americans are homeless 160 000 of them children this is the very first time the committee has convened a hearing focused entirely on homelessness it is long overdue the hearing exemplified the expansive footprint of the financial services committee which has a hand in virtually every corner of the economy from banking to capital markets to commodity prices to consumer and investor protection to affordable housing to macroeconomic management fair lending doesn t exist absent civil rights and human rights play a role or should in corporate investment the entire economy flows through wall street and therefore through the house financial services committee by making homelessness its initial topic of study waters made clear that the committee had changed not just its partisan balance of power but also its perspective and perhaps even its mission long a legislative backwater filled by early career members of congress seeking wall street campaign contributions the committee has now been altered by the presence of several progressives who have sworn off corporate cash new members like alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and katie porter d ca reached the committee due to a series of happy accidents from which the financial industry is still reeling this metamorphosis shouldn t be overemphasized plenty of corporate friendly democrats hold down senior positions and the committee could still bestow bipartisan gifts on the financial sector chairwoman waters s delicate task will be to balance the disparate interests of centrist warhorses and progressive firebrands but early returns have been encouraging already there have been serious moves toward oversight hearings holding the feet of regulators and industry ceos to the fire and strong legislation introduced ultimately the committee must answer the same question before the entire democratic caucus whether to produce a bold new vision for legislative action or succumb to the cramped technocratic model of the past the importance of the progressive beachhead on financial services may not be felt this year or even this session but after the next financial crisis having progressives willing to carry forward structural responses to financial misconduct could make a huge difference in 2008 the public was alerted and alarmed and angry to do something but there wasn t the washington leadership necessary says marcus stanley of americans for financial reform a coalition formed to bridge that gap it s unpredictable what would happen in another crash but if there is one we won t miss the opportunity again since the late 1970s the house financial services committee has done wall street s bidding nearly unreservedly regardless of the party in power democratic committee chairs sent deregulatory measures to republican presidents and republican committee chairs sent deregulatory measures to democratic presidents fernand st germain a rhode island democrat who used his political clout to get cut into lucrative real estate development deals and secure no money down bank loans for his purchase of several international house of pancakes restaurants chaired the committee in the 1980s under his leadership the committee churned out bills that deregulated the savings and loan industry and created the architecture for the catastrophic mortgage backed securities market president reagan signed them into law jim leach a moderate republican who took over after the gingrich revolution in 1994 co authored gramm leach bliley which ended the glass steagall separation between commercial and investment banks leach s committee also reported out the commodity futures modernization act which barred the regulation of derivatives another core cause of the 2008 crisis president clinton signed those in the mid 2000s democratic congressional leaders sketched out a more purely political role for financial services which overshadowed and shaped its policy work people who got on that committee for the most part were mostly conservative members who wanted to raise money says brad miller a democrat from north carolina who served on financial services from 2003 to 2013 co authoring the bill that would eventually create the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb they were told this is a great committee to raise money from call this list of lobbyists after victorious 2006 and 2008 elections the democratic leadership led by democratic congressional campaign committee chair rahm emanuel made room on financial services for newly elected swing district centrists frontline members in congressional parlance thereby giving them access to wall street bankers and lobbyists who could fill their campaign war chests for their re election this ballooned the size of the committee to the second largest in congress barney frank the committee chair at the time pleaded with the house leadership in 2008 to cut the membership to a more manageable level but he was rebuffed too many frontline members needed a piece of the action expand victor juhasz after 2008 the newly reconstituted financial services committee transformed from a sleepy panel that slowly chipped away at the regulatory state to the first line of response to the financial crisis unprepared for this challenge committee members got nearly all their information about the crisis from the banks themselves miller admits he had to search credit default swaps on wikipedia to understand what was happening in computers there s an interruption of service attack the site is so overwhelmed it shuts down miller says that s sort of true of members they re so overwhelmed with the need to call and talk to lobbyists there s no time in the day to learn the substance of the issue this lack of expertise and one way information flow led to a dodd frank reform law that was far more modest than it could have been needless to say reliance on a powerful industry for campaign cash does not elicit a populist instinct with republicans voting as a deregulatory bloc it took only a handful of democratic members to tip committee votes frequently creating a pro bank majority on a panel controlled by democrats on several key votes frank did not have control of his fellow democrats good legislation was sacrificed for campaign finance one such instance arose when the committee considered whether auto dealers should be regulated by the cfpb buying a car is one of the largest financial transactions most people make but republicans wanted to shield the industry from oversight the author of the provision providing that shield republican john campbell was a former saab dealer from orange county who still collected rent on some dealerships seats are arranged in the financial services committee by seniority the higher rows contained senior members when campbell s auto dealer amendment came to a vote top row democrats all renounced it but one by one new members on the bottom two rows voted with republicans positioning themselves to win favor from auto dealers in their districts once the outcome became clear even top row democrats started changing their votes if the auto dealers were going to win anyway they might as well stay on their good side the bill absolutely got better in the senate said andy green who worked for senator jeff merkley d or at the time and is now with the center for american progress the senate isn t exactly a bastion of populists but compared to the skittish conservative democrats driving the process in the financial services committee senators might as well have all been robert la follette after a resounding victory in 2018 many assumed that democrats would return to seating their newly elected frontline members on financial services but the party s leaders faced two major quandaries first the progressive caucus representing about 40 percent of house democrats made a strategic effort to capture more power nancy pelosi needed progressive votes to return as speaker so caucus co chairs mark pocan d wi and pramila jayapal d wa cut a deal for proportional representation on four key money committees that carry domestic legislation including the financial services committee refusing to break with tradition however pelosi declined to give freshmen any slots on three of those money committees ways and means energy and commerce and appropriations that made it hard to reach the quota she d agreed to financial services had long been a roost for freshmen but mostly of the swing district variety this time around however practically nobody wanted to serve on the committee the party even considered shrinking its size an unheard of option why was financial services suddenly considered anathema katie porter a freshman democratic congresswoman from california explained it to her constituents at a january town hall in irvine the majority of my incoming freshman colleagues don t take corporate pac money she explained when you don t take corporate pac money the number of people with a burning interest in banks and their money is much smaller this corporate pac purge was mostly symbolic most campaign cash comes from wealthy donors rather than pacs but over 170 federal candidates took the no corporate pacmoney pledge including 36 first time democratic house members pac donations happen to be a major way that wall street firms funnel funds to financial services committee members that plus the general toxic reputation of big banks made swing district freshmen look elsewhere for their committee assignments for progressives financial services has historically not held much appeal many have backgrounds in legal aid or unions and tend to cluster in the judiciary or education and labor committees which reflect those interests nobody enters politics to make a difference on collateralized loan obligations and trust preferred securities well nobody except katie porter a consumer advocate who studied under elizabeth warren at harvard law and later co authored a book with her porter went on to teach at the university of california irvine she was one of the first in the country to recognize routine fraud in foreclosure processes her paper misbehavior and mistake in bankruptcy mortgage claims discovered that lenders lacked evidence to validate the debts they claimed were rightfully theirs in almost half of the cases she studied later as the independent monitor of california s share of the national foreclosure fraud settlement porter transformed a thankless job into an activist position personally intervening with numerous banks to achieve better outcomes for homeowners last november porter won a swing seat in orange county that had never been occupied by democrats in fact it was the seat once occupied by john campbell the onetime car dealer who d authored the industry s exemption from cfpb oversight after she won members would ask her what committee she wanted to work on i wouldn t waver i d say the house financial services committee it is my life she says porter adds that waters reached out to progressives individually to get them interested reminding them of the committee s broad jurisdiction and importance if you said to someone do you want to be on a committee about the sec they d say uhh porter explains but if you say do you want to be on a committee about saving for retirement if you re interested in inequality economic opportunity this is a committee you want to be part of expand j scott applewhite ap images many freshmen eventually agreed including ocasio cortez who sat down with waters before the new congress began fellow justice democrats rashida tlaib of michigan and ayanna pressley of massachusetts who defeated financial services committee member michael capuano in a democratic primary also expressed interest crucially pelosi needed these progressive members to reach the money committee quota she d agreed to when the final tallies were announced 14 of the 34 democrats on the committee were progressive caucus members about 41 percent nine progressive caucus members were newly installed on the committee including porter tlaib pressley and aoc the flip side however is that there are 20 democrats on financial services who are not progressive caucus members including several subcommittee chairs and longtime fixtures sixteen are members of the new democrat coalition the bank friendly alternative to the progressive caucus last year the main bipartisan law signed by donald trump was a bank deregulation measure six current committee democrats voted for it the head of the consumer protection subcommittee is gregory meeks of new york a new democrat who describes himself as a bridge builder between consumer advocates and wall street jim himes and josh gottheimer represent wall street bedroom communities in connecticut and new jersey respectively himes is the outgoing chair of the new democrats gottheimer recruited ideological allies to join financial services as a counterweight to the progressives in the middle of this ideological split sits waters whom wall street fought to prevent from becoming the democratic ranking member after barney frank retired the 15 term progressive has endeared herself to the millennial left with her withering comments about the trump administration earning the nickname auntie maxine but she joined financial services as a freshman member traveling a long road before finally receiving the gavel 28 years later as ranking member waters admirably took aim at her own colleagues in the congressional black caucus like meeks when they joined with republicans to weaken dodd frank she has introduced legislation to break up wells fargo after the bank s cascade of consumer scandals as incoming chair she eagerly recruited progressive caucus members as reinforcements she s a progressive and would like to get things done but she needed more votes says dennis kelleher ceo of better markets an advocacy group for financial reform but waters has also had an open door policy with big banks during her tenure and a solid working relationship with her republican counterpart on the committee patrick mchenry r nc with whom she has introduced bipartisan bills she s been a vocal supporter of policies like federal flood insurance and the export import bank which critics have respectively savaged as a failure to reckon with climate catastrophe and an unnecessary outlay of corporate welfare despite this duality we don t have to guess much at waters s agenda for this congress alone among committee chairs she laid out her thinking in a january policy speech at the center for american progress she led with a strong defense of dodd frank in particular the consumer financial protection bureau which the trump administration has consistently tried to undermine through actions like demoting the office of fair lending and eliminating supervisory exams for lenders to military families waters s bill the consumers first act would reverse these actions and she vowed to call in bank regulators to ensure that they keep their hands off other pieces of dodd frank and properly enforce the law waters then highlighted several issues that have already become priorities in the initial months of her leadership she promised a bill to fight homelessness that would provide more than 13 billion in new federal funding she expressed a desire to overhaul the credit reporting industry which has been stung by data breaches and high error rates and she vowed to create a new subcommittee on diversity and inclusion covering representation among employees in the financial services industry an african american woman taking the gavel and saying we need to make race and diversity issues important that s a powerful statement says andy green of the center for american progress who helped host the speech the chairwoman also made several nods to working across the aisle she planned to re introduce a bill with mchenry to limit corporate insider trading she called for reauthorization and reform of flood insurance the ex im bank and the terrorism risk insurance program a bailout guarantee for private insurance companies in the event of a 9 11 style attack i d also expect another attempt at an expanded jobs act a law passed under obama that made it easier for companies to raise private capital and eventually go public the jobs act allows companies to present lower income investors with minimal information about their business and still solicit funds it hasn t done much to increase business startups but has added the risk of swindling for unsophisticated investors and the jobs act expansion would just deregulate investor protections even more waters supported the expanded jobs act last year waters also laid out principles for legislation dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac the mortgage securitization giants that have been under government conservatorship for over a decade while she wants to prioritize underserved homeowners and access to affordable housing advocates have long worried that the trump administration wants to privatize fannie and freddie transferring a lucrative government guarantee to financial companies while securing a windfall for hedge funds that have bet on privatization by purchasing discounted fannie and freddie stock waters doesn t appear to support privatization but giving oxygen to housing finance reform could empower centrist democrats to connive with republicans on a policy far to the right of her goals overall the speech was strong on defending dodd frank we won t see weakening legislation in this congress but neither did it suggest a bold alternative vision for fixing what s broken in american finance proposals like creating public options for simple banking through the post office or eliminating risky trading instruments were nowhere to be found finance was manifestly hazardous before donald trump and restoring the pre trump status quo is hardly sufficient it s true that trump would never sign such bills and the senate wouldn t even take them up but under the previous chair the now retired jeb hensarling r tx the financial services committee advanced dozens of bills reflecting their deregulatory priorities regardless of whether they stood a chance of enactment this would signal congressional priorities to regulators who would take their cues accordingly they would pass a bill and even if it didn t pass into law it was a powerful tool for the industry says marcus stanley of americans for financial reform that does not appear to be waters s legislative strategy she wants to put bipartisan points on the board while fighting off the worst deregulatory impulses but the progressives she helped bring onto the committee have bigger ideas and an innate understanding of how to draw attention expand tom williams cq roll call via ap images the new members penchant for capturing notice was on clear display in a february hearing with the ceos of the three major credit reporting bureaus the first major oversight work in the committee this year with bipartisan criticism of the industry s oligopoly and lack of quality control and major legislation from waters that would give consumers more ability to dispute errors on credit reports and end the use of credit checks in hiring decisions there s a real opportunity to curb credit report abuses senior democrats were alternately aggressive and accommodating to the ceos new democrat david scott of georgia fairly slobbered over equifax which is based in atlanta i represent the great state of georgia and love georgia very much you represent a legacy of our great state he said while lauding the steps equifax has taken in the wake of a data breach affecting 143 million americans scott has received 28 000 in pac donations from equifax since 2004 according to the center for responsive politics then katie porter was recognized my question for you is whether you would be willing to share today your social security your birthdate and your address at this public hearing porter asked mark begor equifax s ceo he declined saying it was sensitive information that i like to protect porter asked what might happen if that information was disclosed and begor said he d be concerned about identity theft which has happened to him three times in the last ten years so porter continued my question then is if you agree that exposing information like that you have in your credit reports creates harm therefore you re unwilling to share it why are your lawyers arguing in federal court that there was no injury and no harm created by your data breach indeed responding to a class action lawsuit from consumer victims equifax lawyers claimed that the consumers failed to sufficiently allege injury from having their personal information revealed porter s success at getting the ceo to admit harm from data exposure could significantly disrupt equifax s long standing legal strategy the hearing clip went viral and demonstrated not just porter s importance but also how she models the role of an advocate inside the system and can serve as a mentor for younger progressive members her experience translating hard to understand concepts into digestible chunks can bring public awareness to financial industry schemes one thing i said during the campaign nobody likes to get ripped off porter says republicans democrats frequent voters infrequent voters no category of american likes being cheated to progressive activists porter s questioning was a breakthrough for a democratic party relearning the function of congressional oversight the fortuity that led to the house financial services committee getting such high wattage new members offers a possibility of teaching the party that you can do great politics by doing oversight on corporate america says jeff hauser who runs the revolving door project at the center for economic and policy research the people they re going to be questioning are so broadly disliked it creates a perfect storm for teaching the freshman class that oversight can be fun you ll have other members thinking how can i be like that porter s freshman colleagues while still learning about finance have had moments to shine as well rashida tlaib asked credit reporting bureau ceos what credit scores had to do with anyone s driving history a constituent had informed tlaib that her auto insurance rate spiked because of her credit report an all too rare moment of a lawmaker using a personal story from a constituent to make policy tlaib said she planned to introduce legislation to ban credit scores from factoring into auto insurance rates ocasio cortez has proven to be a masterful questioner in hearings and she hasn t disappointed on financial services in a hearing about providing banking services to legal cannabis related businesses which often operate in cash because the drug is still restricted at the federal level and banks are wary of doing business with them aoc noted that 73 percent of cannabis industry executives in colorado and washington are male and 81 percent are white are we compounding the racial wealth gap right now based on who is getting the first mover advantage she asked a single tweet from aoc reaches millions in an instant she can shine a spotlight on wall street s nefarious practices and she has used that power to call attention to disparities in the economy with an agenda that s more expansive than waters s aoc has listed as top priorities the student loan crisis and postal banking neither of which were in waters s policy speech she told local activists in new york that the committee would hold oversight hearings on banks investments in private prison corporations that profit off immigrant detention shortly thereafter in early march jpmorgan said it would terminate these investments progressive house aides see hearings and member statements as opportunities to add kindling to the outside activism for financial reform when bank ceos come before the committee as has been planned it may offer a chance to build momentum for policies like breaking up large financial institutions which could squeeze centrist democrats and even the chair this wouldn t automatically lead to passing laws but it could help compel democrats to stand for economic justice the industry has been flummoxed about how to approach aoc and the committee s left flank they know that her megaphone can damage their interests and that trying to engage and co opt her could backfire it s like going in to talk to the fbi anything you do or say can be used against you one lobbyist told reuters aoc s chief of staff saikat chakrabarti responded that his boss is here to hold wall street accountable not be your buddy one area where the progressive left should get buy in from waters is on oversight waters has been more aggressive than other committee chairs in scheduling hearings with regulators and industry heads another planned hearing will cover the securities and exchange commission s watering down of the fiduciary rule which was intended to require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients waters has also pressured regulators herself a recent letter she sent to the cfpb sought answers to why recent settlements with financial companies that violated the law did not include restitution to make wronged consumers whole a second letter invited cfpb employees to contact committee staff if they witness waste fraud abuse or gross mismanagement while no subpoenas have yet been issued sources that have consulted with the committee indicate that there s an appetite to investigate financial services staff has already started calling banks with questions and document requests waters told msnbc s chris hayes in february that deutsche bank was actively cooperating with her staff on investigations about money laundering for russian oligarchs deutsche bank of course was donald trump s main lender the discussions are part of a multi committee probe into trump s personal finances one key hire has raised hopes for deeper oversight the committee has brought in bob roach who dug into numerous banking abuses on carl levin s permanent subcommittee on investigations including goldman sachs betting against the housing market before the financial crisis swiss bank tax evasion and hsbc s money laundering with terrorists and drug cartels roach has a sterling reputation for dogged investigative work and will presumably be central to the deutsche bank probe expand right art via ap images roach s presence could also bring much needed sunlight to many other dark corners of finance the role of private equity firms in the demise of the retail sector the staggering sums of unreported money in offshore tax havens the potential bias inside algorithms in the lightly regulated financial technology fintech sector and rampant fraud in the sale of home energy improvement loans to name just a few deep dive investigations take time and resources and experts don t think they would immediately bear fruit but just having roach in the building suggests financial misdeeds will not go unnoticed just as creating a subcommittee on diversity or kicking off its proceedings with a study of homelessness suggested a broader understanding of the committee s work despite the broad ideological range of its members the committee has been reoriented foregrounding vigorous protection of consumers and appropriate skepticism of the industry that approach if it sticks will pay off down the road the six largest wall street banks took home 100 billion in profit in 2018 aided by significant relief from the trump tax cuts overall industry profits hit a new record high while no banks failed in 2018 for the first time in over a decade the huge amounts of money sloshing around the system cannot but help to increase finance s appetite for more risk and as the pendulum swings away from regulating banks as it has under trump a bust eventually follows we don t know how or when the next financial crisis will occur only that it s inevitable the relatively modest tweaks in dodd frank hardly fortified all our defenses when the crisis struck in 2008 many of the financial regulatory groups now in place in washington didn t exist they wouldn t have had many friendly faces or even just informed ones in congress to appeal to anyway the committee with jurisdiction of the financial sector had no idea about the financial sector and that s just the way the financial sector wanted it says former congressman brad miller as a result dodd frank opted for retaining the basic business model and structure of the industry and even the more far reaching provisions of dodd frank have been weakened by a decade of persistent lobbying for changes last year s bipartisan financial deregulation law removed stricter supervision from 25 of the largest 38 banks in america which triggered runaway industry consolidation when the banks freed from regulation teamed up to expand as was not the case in 2008 however there s now a network of advocacy groups with a shelf full of ideas that would truly return finance to its traditional role of supporting the broader economy rather than towering over it the progressive beachhead on the financial services committee could act as a catalyst for that transformative opportunity unmoved by the lure of corporate pacmoney these legislators may actually want to legislate if they do they could return the committee to its posture in the 1960s and 70s under populist chairman wright patman when it passed landmark consumer legislation like the fair credit reporting act the equal credit opportunity act and the truth in lending act all it might take would be a banking committee that actually looks out for bank customers instead of bank executives and yes some positive election results in 2020 it really is the first time where there may be a forum for people to think hard about the big fundamental issues says dennis kelleher of better markets there s a huge unfinished agenda the activist leadership is in place and the ideas are in place too having members on the key committee willing to listen to those ideas and act on them was the final missing piece of the puzzle that puzzle is now complete
