2018 was the year when yet again the socialist model proved its inability to generate benefits for a population the example most discussed by the media was that of venezuela in a humanitarian crisis unprecedented in the americas this south american country is deteriorating every day but it is not the only one another country in latin america that is suffering the consequences of socialist authoritarianism and leaving its economy at the edge of the abyss and its people in collective misery is nicaragua the reform that caused the crisis daniel ortega s government tried to pass a reform to the nicaraguan institute of social security s inss for its acronym in spanish pension system allegedly for the purpose of improving the financial balance of the pension system in order to heal a deficit of more than 76 million dollars a plan was presented to increase employer s contributions by 3 5 percent bringing their total contributions to 22 5 percent to increase workers contributions by 0 75 percent bringing their total contributions to 7 percent and to reduce retirees pensions by 5 percent this triggered a wave of protests in which hundreds of people took to the streets to reject the reforms the government made the terrible decision to repress the protestors by using force which helped the demonstrators gain more followers in little time the protests served to unite thousands of people against corruption censorship and the lack of democracy people from different social sectors socioeconomic contexts and ideologies protested for a change in the system however the situation worsened when violence with the police escalated leaving dozens of people dead or political prisoners in the wake of the political crisis the ortega regime reversed the reform but the damage had been done the violent protests continued the number of political prisoners increased and all the while the silent victim was the nicaraguan economy in this article different facets of this crisis will be described in detail in order to show how badly the current year could end for nicaragua the economic crisis of 2018 according to the world bank and the international monetary fund in 2018 the nicaraguan economy fell by more than 4 percent in terms of gdp according to the nicaraguan foundation for economic and social development funides for its acronym in spanish poverty increased by 9 3 percent in 2018 reaching 38 9 percent more than 157 000 jobs were lost another 300 000 were suspended and more than 10 000 entrepreneurs had to close down their businesses the environment of extreme insecurity uncertainty and fear brought on by the repression and violent protests gravely affected consumer and investor confidence and growth figures of previous years almost 5 percent over the gdp became a thing of the past the wave of murders injuries and imprisonments caused by ortega s repression resulted in a significant downturn in the economy that affected practically all of the productive sectors in a domino effect the crisis then went on to affect tax and social security income collection and also caused a massive outflow of nicaraguan migrants the situation grew worse when united states congressmen began to take note of the disaster brewing in central america the nica act or nicaraguan investment conditionality act was proposed by some united states senators who wanted to press the ortega government to hold free and transparent elections after two failed attempts in the united states congress and following the outbreak of the political crisis the law was approved the law limited loans from international financial organizations to the ortega government it also imposed sanctions on ortega regime officials such as blocking their u s assets and prohibiting them from conducting transactions using the united states financial system this law touched on one of the fundamental pillars of nicaragua s economy its dependence on the united states and its allies this dependence is due as much to the large quantity of remittances that enter the country as it is to the quantity of public investment financed by loans from international cooperation aid agencies more than 70 percent of public investment in 2017 this dependence is also due to the fact that at the beginning of 2018 65 percent of deposits in the country were in dollars the projections for 2019 are not at all encouraging international entities and funides estimate an economic downturn of between 7 and 10 percent the political situation is unclear in the short term uncertainty is rampant in business circles and the contraction of economic activity is evident in the streets where hundreds of businesses remain closed but of all the affected industries perhaps the most critical is the banking sector a slow death for the banking system according to professor richard feinberg and researcher beatriz miranda in the essay a nicaraguan tragedy from consensus to coercion the imf believed that the banking system in nicaragua had liquidity and solvency standards that were much higher than international ones and that its alliances with the government gave it a comfortable legal environment which made it possible to attain large profits however in the middle of the crisis loans fell into default profits disappeared and banking capital was jeopardized the government s violent actions provoked panic among savers and investors resulting in massive withdrawals from the nicaraguan banking system the people making the withdrawals included everybody from small savers who withdrew money in case of emergencies to large investors who took it out of the country according to funides between march 31 and december 31 of 2018 more than 28 percent of the banking system s total deposits were withdrawn situations like this place significant pressure on banks to comply with the cash demands of their account holders which in turn creates pressure for the early recovery of credit portfolios or the acquisition of lines of credit from other financial institutions and indeed credit was affected the loan portfolio contracted by 13 percent in 2018 the contraction of credit is particularly important because it reduces the capacity of other agents in the economy to leverage and improve their returns which in turn removes an important lifesaver from an economy in recession furthermore the banks rushed to buy dollars from the central bank of nicaragua in order to cover the demand for foreign currency for withdrawals or the conversion of córdobas access to international lines of credit became complicated since after the nica act us banks that had done business with nicaraguan banks decided to withdraw from the country towards the end of 2018 wells fargo bank of america jp morgan chase and citi four of the most important banks in the united states decided to end relations with nicaraguan banks complaining of significant risk increases in the country and the difficulties imposed by the restrictions of the nica act international rating agencies have also punished the country decreasing the country s ranking because of socio political risks and raising the country s risk premium making international credit more expensive all of these problems caused the bank to take desperate savings measures such as closing branches firing employees and even pursuing clients with overdue loan payments faced with a massive lack of foreign credit lines the central bank tried to inject liquidity into the banks however with the amount of withdrawals from the system and the lack of other lines of credit this has only resulted in the loss of monetary reserves jeopardizing the exchange rate stability between april and december of 2018 the reserves decreased by 30 percent if this rate of withdrawals should continue they could run out of reserves by this year or next risk of a bank freeze risk of devaluation as of right now one of the greatest risks in nicaragua is the loss of exchange rate stability the exchange rate in nicaragua has been administered by the central bank of nicaragua bcn in spanish since the 1990s via a crawling peg exchange rate system whereby the exchange rate of the córdoba against the us dollar depreciates by 5 percent per year and is adjusted daily so that the devaluation is linear however in recent months the bcn has been making a series of erratic decisions that warn of future exchange problems one such decision was making the monthly rate of currency convertibility discretionary this means that the president of the central bank will decide on a monthly basis how much he wishes to devalue the currency which could break with the traditional 5 percent that has been in place for the last 25 years at the time this decision caused a wave of speculation about severe devaluations but the bcn has respected the 5 percent rule since it was eliminated in october of 2018 it is not viable to modify it any time soon because a large part of the nicaraguan economy is dollarized as are loans however even though the rule had been respected up until now it is no longer a rule this only increases uncertainty for economic agents that remain at the mercy of the will of the central bank an institution that should be among the most stable and trustworthy in order for a country to develop at the macroeconomic level the way it should significant withdrawals of dollar deposits and the consequent loss of reserves risk a de facto devaluation the risk also derives from the lack of reserves available to the central bank of nicaragua the reserves were drastically affected by the demand in commercial banks for dollar withdrawals with the bcn covering 74 percent of the dollars demanded by banks for this purpose as mentioned earlier an unsustainable decrease in reserves would force the central bank to choose one of two options liberate the exchange rate at once limit the outflow of dollars in some way the first option ideal for stabilizing the market would be very painful for an economy that is already in recession and as a result is not politically feasible another solution suggested by economists is to eliminate the indexation of certain goods and services so that the exchange rate hit does not affect interest rates or salaries however this measure would generate great uncertainty among economic agents which would worsen the process of devaluation the second option limiting the outflow of dollars is an path well known by latin american governments facing currency crises in some way this option has already been put in motion with another decision by the bcn to limit financial institutions ability to purchase dollars online in october of 2018 the central bank notified the banks that in order to cover their dollar needs they needed to place a request in writing 48 hours in advance indicating the amount purpose and the entities involved this kind of pre corralito a bank freeze in which the amount of dollars given to banks begins to be restricted opens the door to rigid control of exchanges given to any person or institution in the future resulting in the loss of free currency convertibility from there the bcn can decide to whom it will or will not sell dollars then when reserves reach unsustainable lows the bcn will begin to limit dollars to what the regime considers its priorities thus hurting the rest of the economy one strategy adopted by the bcn in order to fight the reduction in reserves was to take national currency out of circulation the idea was to limit the amount of córdobas in order to try to counteract the decrease of dollars and to maintain the 2 8 ratio the central bank manages in order to stabilize its foreign exchange operations the big problem with this measure is that intentionally reducing the amount of money in circulation slows the economy by leaving economic agents with less liquidity as well as shrinking credit in an economy in recession decreasing money aggravates the recession even more as evidenced by the great depression in the united states in the 1930s what is most likely is that the central bank will make a set of two joint strategies on the one hand given its discretionary power it could change the crawling peg rate of the córdoba while maintaining control of the outflow of dollars in 2019 the crisis will be aggravated by the inss and tax reforms see the following section which will worsen the outflow of capital reducing the supply of money deciding at their discretion to whom they will sell dollars and controlling the outflow of currency from the economy will cause the already waning business confidence to disappear and create the worst crisis the nicaraguans have seen since the time of the sandinistas the coup de grace tax reform and social security inss reform nine months after the inss reform could not be passed in 2018 ortega and his congress approved modifications to social security the reform increased employers contributions from 19 percent to 22 5 percent and workers contributions from 6 25 percent to 7 percent additionally according to funides new retirees pensions were reduced by 35 percent on average despite the private sector s categorical rejection of the reform the government turned a deaf ear for employers it will reduce hiring and cause more layoffs and higher unemployment for workers it will leave them with lower incomes which will end up damaging their already decreased purchasing power the businesses most affected will be those that mainly rely on manual labor but in general unemployment is expected to increase it is true that the reform was vital because if the income of the inss had not been increased in some way the program would have gone bankrupt however the abrupt way in which it was done less gradually than the reform proposed in 2018 will cause a reduction in the liquidity among businesses and families thus aggravating the crisis however the coup de grace for nicaragua s economy was the government s tax reform the reform was considered confiscatory by civil society and sought only to improve the state finances that the same government had worsened by provoking the 2018 crisis in the reform many previously untaxed food products began to be taxed the isr income tax increased certain specific taxes were raised and there were many obstacles preventing a product from being exonerated from the iva tax value added tax or vat however the most outlandish feature was the 1 5 percent tax on exports the tax on food products will limit family consumption it will also push businesses to decrease their productive activity which leads to cutbacks more unemployment and a crisis on a downward spiral according to the nicaraguan chamber of industry consumer prices could increase by 50 to 70 percent if the government s goal was to raise more money the effect will be the exact opposite after reducing the economy and damaging public finances because it will contract the economy further and diminish tax revenues it is absurd to increase costs in an economy that is already in recession because it ends up taking away the little liquidity left in the system such that businesses are left with three options fire employees and save to an extreme extent decrease production to a minimum or close down their businesses nicaragua s potential for competitiveness has been lost with these damages to its industries but it is mainly the ordinary people who suffer unemployment pushes people towards the informal market illegal immigration or crime and any of the three options will decrease nicaraguans quality of life and not satisfied with the damage it has already caused the government has the power to raise taxes again in may if the tax collection does not meet expectations so what to expect in 2019 in 2019 it is sensible to expect a more accelerated reduction of the economy with it falling possibly even more than 10 percent the possibility of banking crises continues to rise if withdrawals continue as they are or if they increase also possible are a pronounced devaluation or a corralito bank freeze that limits the foreign currency that is available to people and businesses the worst thing of all is that the political situation is the real cause of these evils and it does not seem likely that it will change in the short term according to the economist elections are not expected unless political conditions deteriorate drastically since ortega has the support of the army businesses not only have to deal with less sales fewer operations lower international prices of raw materials and a lack of access to financing but now they also have to deal with higher taxes and higher labor costs the uncertainty that the ortega regime introduced into the economy the crisis it created and the economic collapse through which this small central american country is suffering are examples of the tremendous damage authoritarianism causes to economies that are institutionally weak according to funides businesses are already facing a shortage of supplies credit is either scarce or too expensive and providers do not want to give many credit days because of the exchange rate risk we do not know how many years it could take for nicaragua to recover from this hit but every day that ortega stays in power this period lengthens if maduro with an even worse crisis has been able to withstand international sanctions against venezuela ortega seems likely to continue clinging to power as if they were mirrors syria and venezuela reflect cases of authoritarian regimes that have caused severe crises and who maintain power by controlling state institutions with the unconditional support of the military but unless nicaragua wants to continue along the tortuous road that both of those countries have traveled it should change its governing leadership or all efforts will be in vain originally

constant days and exchange rate our operating income was about 90 million or 10 of sales including the acquisition of eliane and headwinds from slower markets pricing pressures and inflation in the us the ceramic industry faced continued pressure from lvt as well as imports from a stronger dollar a group of ceramic tiles has recently filed dumping claims against china the largest ceramic exporter to the us if confirmed tariffs could significantly increase the delivery cost of chinese imports and change competitive pressures due to earlier interest rate increases us home sales and construction slowed although both have recently improved as mortgage rates declined to enhance our position we have begun many initiatives across the business to cover inflation and transportation we implemented

porcelain and large sizes and have began producing wall tile for the us market which replaces other sourced products to support higher sales we have restarted an existing production line that was idled new investments in brazil will expand our porcelain production by the first part of 2020 we have reviewed best practices between eliane and our other ceramic businesses and we are implementing improvements across all groups the european ceramic industry has weakened with the regional economies competition in the market has increased and is pressuring industry pricing we believe we have grown our market share in this environment our sales were driven by commercial outdoor and porcelain slab products as well as higher styled mid price offerings during the period we temporarily lowered our production rates to reduce our inventory we are realigning the production in our european plants and reducing staffing to improve our costs distribution and service we have consolidated management to increase our productivity reengineered our formulations and refined our maintenance processes to reduce transportation expenses and enhance service we have reorganized our eastern european

environment as expected operating income for the segment declined due to lower volume inventory reductions higher material costs and lvt manufacturing variances across the segment we are taking many actions to improve our sales cost and margins to address changing consumer preferences our new residential carpet introductions included more blended multi colored collections and sophisticated patterns our new colormax technology which blends earth tones was voted the best carpet innovation at the national show as polyester products gained share we have differentiated our continuum collections with enhanced color visuals the carpet price increases we ve implemented are being partially offset by declining product mix to ensure that each of our products in the market is priced properly we have instituted better practices and controls we ve replaced high cost assets and are consolidating four inefficient operations which will reduce our overhead and cost structures we are enhancing planning strategies increasing production outputs and reducing process variations to facilitate this realignment these actions are being completed with additional improvements are being

our flooring rest of world segment sales were up 6 as reported and up 16 on a constant days and currency basis our adjusted operating income for this segment was about 95 million or 15 3 of sales up

of our businesses we have been increasing prices on selected products to offset inflation and currency changes we are expanding both our residential and commercial sales organizations to enhance the distribution of our products the segment was impacted by start up costs and under absorption of our new lvt sheet vinyl laminate and carpet tile operations our strategic acquisitions of the flooring

r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you chris and thank you frank as well for the introduction and support over these past weeks i am pleased and excited to be a part of the mohawk team and look very much forward to engaging with you our current and prospective shareholders and the broader investment community to build on an already strong relationship now to the financial performance and the year over year bridges first quarter net sales were 2 4 billion up 1 3 as reported compared to prior year or up 6 adjusted for days on a constant fx basis organic growth in legacy businesses measured in net sales per day on a constant fx basis was positive despite slowing markets and weather in north america up nearly 1 versus prior years one point of clarification for those of you who have picked this up who may not have picked this up already in our last earnings call it was stated that there would be one more day in the first quarter this year versus last year while in actuality there was one less day correspondingly there will be one more day in the fourth quarter this year i hope that clears up any questions back to the financials at the segment level legacy flooring rest of world showed the strongest growth largely offsetting continued weakness in flooring north america gross margin adjusted for special items came in at 27 1 in the first quarter a decrease of 280 basis points versus prior year the decrease was driven primarily due to inflation and inputs of 45 million weaker price mix of 12 million and market related downtime of 7 million partially offset by higher volume including acquisitions of 21 million and lower start up costs of 9 million fx impact on gross margin dollars was 22 million unfavorable in terms of overhead sg a per net sales was 18 7 excluding unusual items up 90 basis points due to investment in samples displays and marketing to drive sales special items in total were 41 million for the quarter of which 15 million was cash of the total 6 million was acquisition related and the remaining 35 million was restructuring made up of charges for replacing high cost assets and consolidating manufacturing and warehousing facilities in flooring north america as well as workforce reductions in global ceramic adjusted operating margin was 8 5 down from 12 1 last year as inflation and input cost headwinds of 51 million weaker price mix of 12 million and lower productivity of 4 million hit the bottom line increased market related downtime and softer volumes of 9 million were offset by reduced start up costs additionally fx translation of 11 million further reduced income and more than offset the transactional fx positive 4 million below the line in other income expense adjusted ebitda was 348 million or 14 3 before interest expense of 10 million up 8 million last year from last year the 2 million increase due to additional debt from acquisitions and share buybacks the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23 and is expected to move into the range of 20 to 22 in the second quarter while still maintaining guidance of 22 to 23 for the full year finally adjusted net earnings per share was 2 13 in the quarter down from 3 01 or 29 versus last year now let me turn to the segments global ceramics had a solid quarter the sales of with sales of 898 million an increase of 2 5 as reported versus last year with legacy sales per day holding at 1 on a constant fx basis adjusted operating income was 90 million or 10 of net sales down from 13 3 margin last year inflation and input cost headwinds were 21 million softer volume and market related downtime amounted to 7 million and additional costs for product development sales personnel and marketing were 5 million improving productivity of 8 million and lower start up costs of 2 million were partial offsets and fx translation was unfavorable by 3 million in the global ceramic segment in the flooring north america segment sales of 922 million decreased year over year by 3 on an as reported basis or 1 4 on a daily rate adjusted operating income dropped to 31 million or 3 4 of net sales in the quarter as input costs of 35 million and other inflation of 4 million combined with weaker volume of 15 million and lower productivity of 13 million were only modestly offset by 3 million in price mix with that said raw material costs peaked in the quarter with improvement expected in the second quarter as lower cost inventory works its way through the process and we also expect seasonally stronger sales now moving to flooring rest of the world the segment performed very well as sales improved year over year by 6 as reported with legacy sales per day up 4 on a constant fx basis acquisitions added 12 to the top line or 69 million adjusted operating income came in at 95 million or 15 3 of sales up 11 including acquisitions and on a constant fx basis as relief on overall inflation of 10 million driven by lower input costs and improved volume totaling 14 million driven by acquisitions and strong performance in lvt laminate and insulation in europe were only partially offset by lower price mix of 16 million fx translation was unfavorable by 8 million corporate expenses and eliminations drove an operating loss of 10 million with the full year estimate in the range of 35 million to 40 million speaking now to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at 1 7 billion with day sales outstanding improving versus the fourth quarter to 56 days roughly in line with last year inventories ended the quarter at 2 3 billion or 126 days slightly better than prior quarter and higher year over year by 293 million due to the ramp up of new plants acquisitions and higher raw material costs as shared in the segment detail inventories were adjusted in the first quarter with plant downtime going forward we will match our production with demand while continuing to try to optimize the supply chain fixed assets for the quarter held at 4 7 billion compared to the prior quarter on capital expenditures of 137 million in the period for 100 of depreciation in line with plan guidance for the full year continues to be capex spending within a range of 550 million to 580 million again roughly in line with depreciation of around 570 million so wrapping up total debt was 3 3 billion at the end of the quarter with leverage at 1 9 times debt to ebitda the balance sheet is strong and free cash flow of 33 million in the quarter improved materially over the same period last year by 100 million underlining expectations of a very solid year in terms of cash generation with that jeff i ll turn it back over to you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you glenn all of our businesses are taking actions to enhance our results with our major focus on lvt manufacturing us carpet performance managing ceramic headwinds and increasing the utilization of new investments in

offerings reducing our costs and ramping up new plants to expand our portfolio we continue to realize increases to offset inflation and restore our margins our lvt sales are expanding significantly and we re making equipment modifications to increase our volume and productivity this year we are restructuring our us carpet and laminate assets and realigning our european ceramic operations to improve our costs and results our recent acquisitions are possibly impacting our results as we integrate them into our business taking all of this into account our eps guidance for the second quarter of 2019 is 2 81 to 2 91 excluding any one time charges we re investing in new products and geographies to drive growth and strengthen our organization to improve our execution we re taking the necessary steps to adapt to the present conditions and deliver greater profitability for the long term we ll now be glad to take your questions simon operator operator questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of stephen east with wells fargo go ahead your line is open stephen east wells fargo securities analyst thank you and good morning guys jeff as you look at the demand both in europe and in the us us is rising europe is starting to slow down could you talk some about the magnitude of each is the us acceleration offsetting europe or not and do you think europe the way you all are forecasting now do you expect europe sales to remain positive for the year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in us the industry we re anticipating with housing and what s going on in the market to be slower this year than last year but we really don t have good visuals into how that s going to evolve depending on the different estimates some people have been picking up dramatically as we go through the year and others have it still hesitating our estimates aren t any better in europe the economies are all slowing across europe and the competition is increasing as that occurs and in that environment we outperformed it in the first quarter we think we can continue to outperform it for the rest of the year stephen east wells fargo securities analyst got you okay and then as you look at flooring north america the big issue is obviously on the margin side versus the revenues but margin down about two thirds versus last year and it actually even though your op income was sequentially declined more than your revenues decline so i guess if you all can rank order the causes of the drop in your op income and any color on how you expect those to continue through the year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer industry sales were weaker the production was lowered in order to reduce the inventories we had high material costs flowing through from prior which impacted the margins the price increases we put in are helping to offset except the mix is going the other direction we ve seen lower material costs and higher prices improving margins going into the second quarter to improve the costs we talked about replacing high cost assets closing inefficient operations we are consolidating multiple warehouses and we are reducing headcounts and overhead to improve the results stephen east wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs with baird your line is open timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst yeah hey hey good morning everybody i guess just maybe my first question on lvt is there any way to provide any sort of kind of numerical update maybe on just how the lvt performance is in north america maybe relative to last quarter or six months ago and how does that compare if you look at europe maybe as a proxy since that capacity has been up little longer than north america jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer what we ve said is that the global capacity when it s operating where we expect will be over a 1 billion when the plants are optimized as we go through in europe the lvt line is ahead of the us line and the process has stabilized the productivity and waste are continuing to get better we have identified equipment modifications which are being executed as the volumes going up to eliminate bottlenecks which are holding it up we are introducing products across our brand and rigid products to use the capacity and we re expanding our customer base in europe in the us we are making engineering modifications similar to ones that have already been put in europe the us is making progress in it we are shipping rigid products in the marketplace as we go through and i don t have any specific numbers to give you but we re confident that lvt will provide us advantages and through the year we ll continue increasing as we increase the volume the overhead absorptions and the returns will get better timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst okay is there of that 1 billion of capacity i mean is there any way to think about what the utilization is today on a run rate basis jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t have it to give you timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst okay and then i guess on the production side of things how are you kind of thinking about production as you kind of move into q2 and i guess if you look at the market for 2019 what market growth level are you assuming in your production expectations is it flat is it up slightly i m just trying to think about how you guys are thinking about top line growth in 19 organically jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s really different by market by market then you have the acquisitions going through i think timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst maybe just the us maybe just the us jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in the us the numbers are not out for last year yet but we re estimating that the industry grew 3 to 3 5 and our assumptions are that with what s going on it ll be slower than that it ll be less than that even with the price inflation that s occurred overall is how we are sort of thinking about it the carpet industry sales in the first quarter were down and so were ours with lvt impacting them as we go through and it s also being impacted by mixed economy as we go through so i don t know if that would help you a little timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst okay no no that s helpful so maybe kind of on a volume basis a flattish sales growth for the market isn t a bad assumption w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse your line is open susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning everybody my first question is how should we think about productivity in the us and especially given the initiatives that you have within carpet consolidating some of those assets lvt obviously coming online laminate all these different kind of projects that are coming through how should we think about those coming together and perhaps improving the productivity over time jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so productivity across the business was impacted by lower manufacturing levels higher costs for the employees and the ramping up of these new projects all end up in productivity to improve the costs we talked about replacing assets and restructuring different parts and operations and we ve reduced both direct labor and overheads we think the productivity will continue to lag in the near term due to the inefficiencies in higher costs but we expect to see improvements continuing throughout the year susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay and then as we do think about the inventories and going into maybe a seasonally stronger period do you think that you ve fully rightsized the business how are you thinking about your level of utilization going into the second and the third quarters jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the inventory levels were up in the period but almost all the inventory increase was up due to new plants that require inventories to support them the acquisitions that we did last year the inventory flowing in and then with the tariffs that were expected the products we re importing from china would dramatically increase the inventories in the period for the most part most of our inventories in the ongoing businesses were kept under control with lower production rates and we re going to match the demand the production with the demand for the most part going forward susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay thank you w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of stephen kim with evercore isi your line is open stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah thanks very much guys i appreciate the time my first question relates to the role that mix played in the quarter and what we could expect into heading into 2q in the rest of the year in particular we noticed that the price mix number was pretty big negative in flooring rest of world and i know you also include mix by product type in your volume numbers and so i wanted to and i noticed that in flooring north america that volume no impact was a little higher than we expected so i guess my question is essentially can you help us understand what the mix dynamics product mix and channel mix were the main drivers in flooring north america and flooring rest of world and should we expect that those trends to be longer lasting throughout the rest of this year w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer for the mix the mix in flooring north america steve is the same thing that s been going on for some time first let me just say what we disclosed and talked about is a combination of price mix we have a difficult time pulling apart and separating them the mix in north america has been negative as we have seen a couple things one product changes where we ve seen product changing from higher price point nylon to lower price point polyester and then as we started putting in price increases that also drove some negative mix as well and then i think you re referring to the on the flooring rest of world the number you re speaking to is price mix combined right not mix itself correct stephen kim evercore isi analyst correct w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer yeah so i think what s happening in flooring rest of world is in some of the categories over there product categories we re seeing raw materials go down and that s impacting pricing jeff i don t know if you want to add anything to that or not jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer last year in the insulation business there was a shortage of raw materials and the prices spiked about 30 or more and the prices have in the recent time come back down so a major part of that is those prices coming down but at the same time it drove our selling prices up impacted the volume of the industry and us and with the prices the price the costs coming down we re lowering the selling prices along with the decreases but the volume of the product category is going up and it s doing reasonably well right now stephen kim evercore isi analyst got it okay that s helpful my second question relates to some of the management changes that we ve seen recently obviously glenn it s nice to have you aboard and frank we re going to be sorry when you re not as present on the calls but we ve also had some other questions regarding sort of deeper within the organization and so my question relates to number one in what is your plan in the global ceramic business and particularly daltile in terms of running that business or are you going to have any differences in how you manage that business and then secondly in flooring north america i wasn t sure if you had yet ahead of the resilient business in within flooring north america i know you broke that into five categories or paul did and so i just wanted to get a sense for how we re doing in terms of staffing on that jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we have a really strong organization and the north american ceramic business is operating well and continues to operate well at the moment we ve chosen for chris to operate as the interim president and we haven t selected another person at this point there s no rush the chris if you remember operated the business for many years and the organization is continuing to go forward we have selected someone else to run the other business and everything s like we would like it w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer stephen i would just comment that the throughout the ceramic segment now the organization is extremely strong europe russia brazil north america and of course j d and i sat beside each other for 20 years i put him in that job and i just want him time to get in the business again and it s working really well jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i just wanted chris to work another day a week stephen kim evercore isi analyst excellent okay thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets your line is open mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions my first question a lot of companies across building products have called out a number of headwinds in the quarter but one in particular has been destocking at large retail could you comment about kind of what the inventory levels are in your or your sense of where the inventory levels are from your larger customers and have you seen any changes in order patterns as part of that comment you made about improvement jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well i can just comment on that in some cases in the ceramic side with large customers we have a lot of new products coming in and they are at the same time taking all the old products out so that s causing some of the destocking that you re talking about or it s just product changes w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer and some of the other ones there were some pushing out of it as it went through also mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it okay my second question jeff it s a bit bigger picture if i step back and think about the moving pieces and what you re talking about in some of your global operations clearly a big focus for you and the company has been expanding internationally over the past decade and increasingly the growth has come in countries that are emerging in nature and it seems like you re adding volatility to the portfolio alongside this global push and i wanted to just ask you how you re thinking about your global strategy at this point based on kind of how the past 12 months or so have informed your results jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t think it s changed anything nothing s come as a surprise you have periods of time where the us dollar strengthens and then the translated results are impacted as part of it the european businesses we re investing in we re trying to grow into other product categories as we ve talked about to expand our footprint in europe we have a strong organization and we think we are outperforming the market in russia we expanded our presence we have the leading ceramic business in russia where we expanded the laminate business and so russia is doing well we ve put in new equipment to expand it and we re putting more investments in as we grow our market share in russia we ve entered the brazilian market with the new acquisitions we made last fall we hired one of the best we bought one of the best businesses and got the talented management alongside it to operate it there will be more volatility in that marketplace but i think we re well positioned to do well within it and so as a general rule i would throw in australia too australia we knew that the marketplace was due for a slowdown and we bought it that was based on what we paid for it we think we paid the right amount for it given that we knew we were headed into it and no surprise that housing was overbuilt and softening right now the results are still good and they re changing the strategies as we go forward so i think we re doing the right things for the long term of the business w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer and mike i would just add one more thing just to make a point russia we ve been in since 2013 with the ceramic acquisition and we ve got a really good strong management team there and they have done a phenomenal job managing through the ups and downs and staying ahead of the market through both increasing and declining environments so overall i think we ve done a pretty good job of managing the complexity of the geographic footprint around the globe jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer but there is more volatility i mean the one we just talked about the translated results from russia 1 5 went in half with the ruble is it collapsed but our business is still strong there and still growing w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer and i would just add one more thing even when we go into a market like brazil we ve known eliane for 20 years we know the management team very well the president very well and so we ve done a lot of work before we make an acquisition like that mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay appreciate the thoughts thank you operator your next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust your line is open keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you there was a comment earlier in the call about reducing capacity specifically in flooring north america can you talk about what specifically you re doing and what s the timeline to get that completed w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer so the first thing is we installed some new low cost extrusion capacity which still is leading to closing in two old extrusion operations we re also closing a yarn plant a small tuck in plant in laminate we built a new warehouse to take off and we re closing two other warehouses and consolidated another plant with that move all of the things have good paybacks based on reducing the costs keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst so jeff are you taking are you lowering your overall extrusion capacity by these moves or are you just planning on that and the carpet volumes are just exceptionally weak in the last six months jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we took out some high cost extrusion and it will be slightly less but not it won t keep it from meeting the ongoing demand keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst are you running extrusion below where you need to run it to make good profits w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer well we consolidate this together so the new assets we have half of it in and running now and the other half going in the next month i think and when we get through the costs our extrusion costs will come down if that s the question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of justin speer with zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys this first question frank or glenn can you walk through or give us your free cash flow expectations for the year and within that your expectations for working capital drag as you map toward a full year number glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is glenn speaking like i said earlier free cash flow was strong in the quarter at 33 million it s 100 million better year over year and our outlook is very good and that s based on the fact that capital spending as we spoke to in our outlook will be down materially year over year and that is all upside versus last year so again we re quite confident in a very strong cash performance and cash generation and ultimately we believe we can whittle down that working capital during the year on efficiencies justin speer zelman associates analyst but i think the number was like 600 million or 700 million that you related last quarter is that still intact glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s north of that justin speer zelman associates analyst in terms of that working capital just looking at that the working capital as a percentage of sales is quite elevated at 25 so i think the highest we ve seen in quite a while and you mentioned a few of the puts and takes there most of the takes but how should we think about that as the year progresses and is there any risk of obsolescence within that number glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well the big driver on that is inventories justin and we ve been working as jeff mentioned to get our inventories down for some time i think that made good we ve made good progress with that the inventories are if you look at it from the end of last quarter to the end of this quarter about 50 million however days actually improved by one and a half days if you compare inventories to a year ago they re up over just a little bit over 290 million and most of that related to the new plants all the investments we re doing that we re putting out probably to get the inventories up before ahead of the sales the acquisitions that we ve done and then the higher chinese inventories that we came in came in to get ahead of the tariffs so i think justin speer zelman associates analyst so i think the last question sorry glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i m just going to say i d just say i think we re managing our inventories well we re making progress and we ll be in line with where we need to be by the end of the year justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you and then next question is just the implied guidance and the sequencing of guidance i know it s an improvement in terms of year over year degradation but the second quarter guidance is below what most were expecting particularly giving the lower inputs that we saw with oil collapsing into january i know it s since reaccelerated but oil inputs down quite a bit pricing still good why is that the margin profile better next quarter and when should we see the year over year become more neutralized in your mind as we think as we started thinking about potentially a better back half in terms of underlying demand jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer as you said the results for the first quarter were at the high end of our expectations we expect the second quarter results to improve with higher pricing and volume and lower raw material costs at the same time as we look out we see the economy slowing and we see housing growth under pressure we also are having difficulty anticipating what the inflation is going to be for the rest of the year what we ve continued to say is that the year over year decline in margins will improve throughout the year and keep getting better and the future periods will have higher production rates will have increased pricing there will be less start up costs in them and we will start getting some of the benefits from the restructurings that we ve been talking about justin speer zelman associates analyst and can you quantify any of the restructuring benefit this year that falls into this year that you ve just announced in the press release w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer we ll get some the activities will be ongoing through this year and then we ll see a much better benefit larger benefit full year benefit as we move into next year justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of john baugh with stifel your line is open john baugh stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you for taking my questions and my condolences on john swift s passing sad news my question is two different ones one did you have a material increase in the amount of imported lvt to sell either year over year or sequentially and then is there any update on the accretion from the acquisitions you ve done any update with macro slowing particularly in australia to that guidance thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the important lvt sales are going up significantly we also brought in more inventory based on thinking there could be a 25 tariff increase ahead of it also the sales of our own manufacturing products are also going up as we go through you have the guidance we ve given glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well the accretion guidance hasn t really changed john i think we said for eliane the brazilian acquisition we expected annual eps accretion in the first year of about 0 15 and then on godfrey hirst i think we had said accretion of 0 15 in the second half of last year so about 0 30 for the full year so those numbers haven t changed john baugh stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you good luck operator your next caller or your next question comes from the line of phil ng with jefferies your line is open philip ng jefferies analyst hey guys i think part of the path toward earnings improvement going forward at some point productivity would flip positive you start lapping some of these price cost headwinds and you re done drawing down inventory just curious it d be helpful for you to kind of give us a sense if any of these pieces you re expecting to flip positively in the next few quarters or just any color on some of the time frame would be really helpful jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think that we do expect those but at the same time we are having difficulty estimating the economies in the housing pieces we go through as well as the inflation right now and the only guidance we ve given is what we keep saying that the year over year decline in margins will improve and get better as we go through the year philip ng jefferies analyst okay and just on the product just in terms of production and inventory it sounds like it s a work in progress should we expect that to be a big headwind going forward just because it s been a drawdown dynamic throughout last few quarters do you have any better line of sight on that trend jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer most of it s behind us but there s still some of it left because the first quarter wasn t quite as strong as we thought but for the most part as we said we will be manufacturing most of the businesses similar to the demand philip ng jefferies analyst got it and then from a capacity standpoint just curious if you could give a little color in terms of where your capacity utilization is shaking out with some of the initiatives you ve done in north america going forward whether it s carpet is there an opportunity for you to kind of repurpose maybe some of your vinyl capacity into lvt thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the different assets manufacture different products and so you can t relatively you can t easily switch them between one product category in another next question operator operator your next question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet your line is open michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi thanks for taking my question i just want to ask the margin question in other way i understand the pressures to 2q year over year since you re still destocking and there s a lot of price mix pressures but in third quarter you begin to lap some pretty major headwinds that were supposed to be temporary i m curious by third quarter what are the major pressure points to margins if you can is there going to be lower productivity or higher mix negative mix or cost pressures jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean the problem we re having is you re asking for specific ongoing guidance which we continue to say we are giving the general piece of where it is we think that we have a lot of actions in place to improve our position in the business there s some questions about what will happen in the different environments such as depends on who you listen to the dollar strength could go up significantly depending on somebody or could go the other way dramatically depending on who you listen to the oil price hit recent highs lately it could be at 55 or it could be at 80 then which impacts the prices there s a lot of variables which we don t know how to put into the specifics and we don t want to lead you astray michael wood nomura instinet analyst understood okay and you talked about price being implemented across some product categories do you know yet whether or not they ve been successful taken by the market and any quantification in terms of what that incremental benefit could be jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there are price increases and most products and most geographies that have been implemented and the prices are flowing into the business which is helping the second quarter also there is increases in various places you mentioned brazil the gas prices have gone up astronomically we have the same thing in mexico as yet so the pricing is covering in some cases it s covering the changing pieces in other cases it should help the margin which is why the second quarter is going to be better michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you operator the final question is from the line of matthew bouley with barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst hi thanks for taking my question on the inflation side jeff understanding it s not your business to predict commodities but how does that oil price rebound kind of impact your thoughts around price increases specifically in carpet do you think that further price increases would be necessary just kind of looking at where commodities are at this point thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s too early to tell the price is highly volatile it could drop significantly or stay the same or go up in general it takes anywhere from two months to three months four months to pass through to our purchases and that also changes depending on supply and demand dynamics of the various steps in between so we re watching it and we ll have to see the move has been recent and we have no idea whether it s going to it s going to be maintained or if it s going to go up or down from here quickly so our guesses are no better than anybody else in the oil business and the chemical businesses as you go through with that i d like to make sure everybody understands that we re taking the actions to improve our results we re confident that our new investments will give us the returns we want in time as we wrap them up we re taking actions to improve the existing businesses and we appreciate you joining us for the call thank you very much operator ladies and

my unpublished 100 000 word book the financial jigsaw is being serialised here weekly in 100 issues by peter j underwood author quote of the week every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed this world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under the clouds of war it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron dwight d eisenhower last week we covered several aspects of inflation including hyperinflation and the velocity of money here is the link to last week issue 48 this week is the last item on this chapter 9 inflation deflation next week we will move on to chapter 10 national economies which might prove more interesting and less academic inflation and the hidden effects of shrinkflation here is something that i haven t covered in my book but recently my wife and i have noticed certain products remaining in the same sized pack but containing less actual material washing powder and shampoo are typical examples here is an article explaining this disturbing trend which can t be measured by our standard statistical methods and what about toilet paper and it s being going on for 40 years we are very slow on the uptake i wonder where all the inflation went as i will prove in this piece the people who believe in the low inflation myth are being fooled by the fact that inflation in this unusual central bank driven economic cycle is concentrated in asset prices rather than in consumer prices and before we leave inflation here s a note from tbp this week on the effects for social security now that brexit might be coming to a conclusion after almost three years i will continue to provide weekly updates as events progress brexit update 26th april 2019 here s some interesting news from naked capitalism given how first past the thinking is so deeply ingrained in uk politics it s hard to see how to arrive at a consensus on a second best option for most voters and on top of that softer brexit is a unicorn rich zone so there s a large risk that even if the pols were able to agree on something that something might not be on offer from the eu richard north didn t need a big poll to come to the same conclusion therefore much as we need a plan for brexit with the nation uniting behind it this is not going to happen even if the system was capable of generating a plan which had a scintilla of credibility the majority would oppose it in this nation of ours the idea of a national plan is neither a practical nor political reality dr richard north s blog can be followed at this is one of the few websites to give a true record of brexit progress the eu election 23rd may 2019 in this election people will be electing meps members of the european parliament in other words people who will have very little material say on the brexit process is it just me or it seems bizarre that people are being asked to vote on the basis of an issue about which those they elect will have no say it makes these elections a travesty of what elections should be about carry on reading at parliament returned to work on tuesday following the easter holiday so here is a report on this front the brexit deadline is still 31st october 2019 and remains in place unless the pm can get parliament to agree an exit plan beforehand at present this looks unlikely but with a review at the end of june and with a decision to leave passed by parliament by 22nd june the uk will avoid ratification of the eu elections on 23nd may 2019 details of parliament s deliberations can be found here chapter 9 inflation deflation there are known knowns there are things we know that we know there are known unknowns there are things that we now know we don t know but there are also unknown unknowns there are things we do not know we don t know the original source of this koan may be landmark education of seattle washington although generally it is attributed to former us defence secretary donald rumsfeld there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics mark twain in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value alan greenspan america drives the global economy with false money although europe is suffering a continuing recession through 2010 to date which will likely not be resolved for some years it is the usa which is driving the global financial system towards its breaking point nobody can forecast what will happen or when but the present trajectory of the system indicates that at some point all this money printing will have to stop and the consequences are unknown except that it is fairly certain that interest rates will continue to rise with consumer inflation eventually following i will forsake another thought experiment at this stage but instead use an analogy which illustrates the strange relationship between the united states and its trading partners of which i read recently the king bought a suit every week and he paid the tailor with a cheque which the tailor put in his drawer after years and years of paying with his cheques the king had an enormous debt to the tailor who had a huge cash balance in his coffers which he thought made him a very rich man suddenly the tailor was in a position to cash his cheques and the king was now visibly insolvent this analogy demonstrates how the united states of america is in the same position as that of the king the usa pays its debts internally in so much that it finances its budget deficit created by congress policy and the president by issuing its dollar currency which finances its balance of payments deficits abroad by issuing dollar cheques bonds to foreign countries and foreign suppliers in practice these are us treasury bonds the foreign suppliers do not cash their cheques bonds they accumulate them in their central banks or in their treasuries in the form of huge dollar balances which today amount to approximately 22 trillion dollars national debt the king the united states is running a massive 1 trillion financial annual deficit but paying for it with cheques that are not being cashed they are merely promises to pay and the deficit thus the national debt of the united states continues to increase year in and year out because so far there has been no cause for the global community to do otherwise than believe in the greatest economic power the world has ever seen nobody is asking the usa to pay up and the foreigners are thus in the position of the tailor as they accumulate their cheques but the king the united states is in reality insolvent everyone knows that there is no way the usa can repay its debts however the last thing any creditor wants to do is to force liquidation the general pattern of human behaviour is to kick the can down the road and close one s eyes to the inevitable until an event occurs that forces the final whistle game over that event is yet to occur but my experience of past insolvencies tells me that it will occur in due time the dollar s reserve currency status allows foreigners and others to finance the us budget deficit and its trade deficit nobody wants to take away the united states credit card upon which there are no restraints least of all for the united states itself the nations that absorb these reserves want a place where they can deposit them and then quickly sell them if they have to and that kind of liquidity is available only in u s markets the price of this privilege is that in order to maintain the dollar s reserve currency role and in order for the foreign countries to accept it they have to accept a decline in the value of the dollar which implies continuing inflation the imf have plans in the event of a dollar collapse which will be discussed in later issues various differing causes and effects of inflation reviewed we have seen that there are essentially three components required to create an inflationary environment commodity price inflation is certainly one of them as it impacts the ability of the average consumer to buy more and thus expand the economy we have touched on the other two the stock of money velocity of money or how fast the money is flowing through the system from the banks to businesses and ultimately consumers and wage growth which gives the consumer increased purchasing power to fuel growth in a recent national federation of independent business nfib survey in usa only a small fraction of respondents stated that this was a good time to expand their business whilst the majority of respondents stated that their major concerns were poor sales taxes and government regulations the reader might well be a small business which coincidently creates roughly 70 of all new jobs in the economy and are probably worried now about poor sales prospects and a weak economic environment in uk and eu as well as the usa it is highly unlikely that you are going to borrow money to expand your business or extend credit to customers even if you can businesses will choose to hoard cash as a guard against a weak economic environment instead of making productive investments that will lead to more jobs and higher wages and more economic growth besides the rise and fall of commodity prices which do indeed contribute to the inflationary backdrop the demand for money to make productive investments by businesses which leads to higher levels of production wage growth and ultimately consumption is what drives overall inflation in current economics inflation is defined as a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time when the general price level rises each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services consequently inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy it is difficult to have a general rise in price levels amid a lack of consumer demand driven by suppressed wages high levels of employment and little demand for credit by businesses the lack of demand exerts downward pressure on the pricing of goods and services keeping businesses on the defensive this virtuous spiral is why deflationary environments are considered to be so dangerous and very difficult to break by studying charts of the relationship between these three variables we can observe correlation between the rise and fall of employees wages and the velocity of the money supply which has been plunging to historically low levels since 2008 and does not encourage sustained increases in either employment or wages as the demand for money is so low however always be aware that in statistics correlation is not causation although we may easily perceive this to be the case another example of misperceptions rising asset prices negate a growing economy which results in a liquidity trap in the 1970 s the global economy suffered real inflation and rapidly rising interest rates reaching 25 per annum in the uk at one stage inflationary pressures have risen recently although economic growth has been torpid however even this movement in both economic growth and inflationary pressures peaked in early 2011 and has been in steady decline since this is why the federal reserve remains concerned about their monetary experiment of printing money euphemistically known as monetary stimulus inflating asset prices higher has increased consumer confidence to some extent but has not translated into economic growth this clearly warns of rising deflationary pressures in the economy and the risk that the federal reserve is now caught in what economists call a liquidity trap as mentioned earlier the federal reserve cannot effectively withdraw from its monetary interventions and raise interest rates to more productive levels without pushing the economy further into recession the overriding deflationary drag on the economy has forced the federal reserve and other central banks boe ecb pboc and boj to print money qe and thus force down interest rates to support even this historically low level of economic activity whilst the boe ecb pboc and boj were printing 300bn every month and mainstream economists and analysts kept predicting stronger levels of economic growth it never happened the end of economic growth may already be here chapter 12 details how and why global economic growth has stalled and is unlikely to recommence the dollar in 1971 buys only 18 cents of goods today and that is inflation engineered and implemented by the bankers in their dysfunctional 21st century global economic system these pieces of the financial jigsaw are possibly the most depressing because everyone is powerless in the face of this despotic hidden tax the next chapter will expand on the theme we have set here and will see how the next piece of the jigsaw fits so snugly into our inflationary environment of false promises and failed policies part 2 of my book to be published separately will help you manage your personal economic and financial affairs and future projections

available in today s press release and in the company s most recent sec filings information presented and discussed on this call is representative as of today only brink s assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements the call is copyrighted and may not be used without written permission from brink s it is now my pleasure to introduce your host ed cunningham vice president of investor relations and corporate communications mr cunningham you may begin ed cunningham vice president investor relations corporate communication thanks denise and good morning everyone joining me today are ceo doug pertz and cfo ron domanico this morning we reported first quarter results on both gaap and non gaap basis the non gaap results exclude a number of items including our venezuela operations the impact of argentina s highly inflationary accounting reorganization and restructuring costs items related to acquisitions and dispositions and costs related to certain accounting compliance modes we are also providing our results on a constant currency basis which just eliminates changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year we believe the non gaap results make it easier for investors to assess operating performance between periods accordingly our comments today including those referring to our guidance will focus primarily on non gaap results reconciliations of non gaap to gaap results are provided in the press release in the appendix to the slides we re using today and in this morning s 8 k filing all of which can be found on our website finally please note that the page 3 of the press release provides the details behind our 2019 guidance including revenue operating profit non controlling interest income taxes and adjusted ebitda i ll now turn the call over to doug douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks ed good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today we reported strong first quarter results including a 19 increase in non gaap operating profit these results were heavily driven by continued profit momentum in the us and mexico easily offsetting the 10 million profit decline that we expected in argentina due to currency translation in constant currency operating profit and eps were up 50 and 59 respectively first quarter results support our full year guidance which targets operating profit growth of 20 despite the expected persistence of currency headwinds our full year guidance also includes approximately 20 million to 30 million of increased operating expenses to support our new strategic initiatives and it expenditures as we move through the next three quarters of 2019 we expect organic growth initiatives and acquisition related synergies to drive profit growth across all segments we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to diminish over the next three quarters as inflation driven price increases should exceed projected devaluation in argentina together these factors support an expected increase of 100 basis points in full year margin rate to approximately 11 with an ebitda margin rate of over 16 in a few minutes i ll review our guidance in more detail along with some comments about our strategies to drive continued organic and acquisition related growth i ll also discuss our plans to introduce our next layer of our growth strategy but i ll summarize our first quarter results first first quarter earnings per share increased 16 on an organic revenue growth of 6 the operating profit growth of 19 reflects a margin rate increase of 100 basis points to 9 4 and an adjusted ebitda rose 20 or 22 million to 132 million in the quarter we achieved these results despite negative currency translation that reduced our earnings by 0 29 per share while the dollar strengthened against most currencies most of the unfavorable fx impact was in argentina where strong local currency growth was more than offset by the approximate 50 devaluation in the peso that drove a year over year operating profit decline of 10 million the fact that we reported strong overall earnings growth of 19 i think is a testament to the successful execution of our strategy we continue to believe that our true operating performance is probably best illustrated by evaluating our results on a local currency basis in constant currency revenue was up 17 profit growth was 50 adjusted ebitda was up 42 and eps was up 59 this strong start to 2019 supports our full year guidance and keeps us on a track that is well ahead of our initial three year strategic plan targets it s clear that our strategy to drive profitable growth both organically and through acquisitions is working and we still have great opportunities to accelerate momentum we ve already achieved before turning over to ron i want to discuss the us and its efforts to improve margins in our core legacy business and integration of the dunbar acquisition both of these initiatives are going well our us business was the single biggest driver in their first quarter both in terms of revenue and profit growth it s also our current single greatest opportunities to drive future value creation first quarter us revenues grew 53 to 297 million due primarily to the addition of dunbar which was not part of brink s in last year s first quarter this year s first quarter revenue in our legacy us business was up 4 5 us operating profit for the quarter increased more than 200 half from the acquired dunbar business and half from our legacy breakthrough initiatives and synergies this reflects a doubling of our overall us margin rate to 8 1 versus 4 1 last year which includes a 50 plus percent organic margin rate improvement in our legacy business our integration efforts are ahead of schedule and our us operations are on track to achieve our targeted 2019 exit margin rate of approximately 10 looking ahead we are on track to deliver at least 45 million of growth excuse me a profit growth through cost synergies by 2021 or sooner and as we disclosed earlier this year our us business is targeting a margin rate of 13 by the end of 2021 on a revenue base that we expect to exceed 1 3 billion the increase in our us margins to 13 from 6 8 last year will be driven by continued organic improvement from our breakthrough and other initiatives and supplemented by the dunbar acquisition synergies now i ll turn it over to ron to review our financials ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug and good day everyone today in the united states is administrative assistants day and doug and i want to recognize kim harsha ph and tracy wright ph for their amazing support i ll start with our first quarter results beginning on the left side of slide 7 first quarter revenue grew 6 which included 48 million of organic growth and 100 million from the acquisitions completed over the last 12 months most notably dunbar in the united states and rodoban in brazil organic revenue growth in north america was 6 a 400 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2018 south america organic revenue continued its double digit trend growing 12 rest of world revenue was flat on an organic basis and was impacted by the loss of 21 million of revenue from the disposition of our french aviation guarding business in the second quarter of 2018 and negative forex total negative forex translation reduced revenue by 97 million driven primarily by the steep devaluation of the argentine peso and to a lesser degree the brazilian real and the euro first quarter operating profit rose 19 to 85 million despite strong currency headwinds organic profit growth of 23 million or 32 was driven primarily by the us mexico and argentina this growth was supplemented by 13 million from the dunbar and rodoban acquisitions generating a 50 constant currency operating profit growth that doug referenced our consolidated operating profit margin was up 100 bps to 9 4 despite 22 million of negative translation forex for perspective it s interesting to note that in the first quarter of 2016 operating profit was 34 million with over 70 generated by south america and less than 12 from north america three years later in the first quarter of 2019 operating profit at 85 million was 2 5 times greater and north america contributed 52 the operating profit margin of our north america segment increased 370 bps to 10 1 led by mexico which is well ahead of its three year plan 2019 target of 15 our south american operations are performing well on a local currency basis excluding the impact of forex constant currency operating profit was up 17 led by argentina and chile organic operating profit in the segment grew by 9 the rest of the world profit margin increased 70 bps to 9 9 the recovery of our legacy french operations and the continued integration of temis generated positive profit growth versus the first quarter of 2018 separately the pending acquisition by loomis of prosegur s operations in france may provide opportunities to grow our business in that country first quarter corporate expenses decreased 4 million lower security costs and currency translation gains were partially offset by higher non cash equity based compensation and strategy 2 0 related marketing and product costs for the full year including 20 million to 30 million of investments in strategy 2 0 and it initiatives we expect corporate expenses to be approximately 130 million with about 35 million from non cash share based compensation an increase of about 10 million versus 2018 now let s discuss argentina argentina is an important business for brink s and our management team is doing an exceptional job of operating in a challenging highly inflationary environment the bars on top of this slide show the negative impact on reported operating profit in us dollars due to the devaluation of the argentine peso the forecasted peso to us dollar exchange rate for 2019 is shown on the top of each bar and the rate for 2018 is below each bar bars at the bottom of the slide illustrate the year over year change and brink s argentina operating profit in us dollars negative variances are in red and positive variances are in green in the first quarter 2019 versus the same period last year the devaluation of the peso had a negative impact of 19 million on reported profit inflation driven price increases operational improvements and additional maco synergies offset about half of this impact and our reported us dollar operating profit was down by 10 million as we move through 2019 we expect the peso to continue to devalue but the impact of that devaluation should diminish each quarter versus prior year comparisons for the full year in argentina we expect a negative forex impact of about 55 million for reported operating profit for the remaining three quarters of 2019 we expect that our continued local currency momentum will fully offset devaluation said differently we expect argentina 2019 full year us dollar operating profit to be approximately 10 million less than it was in 2018 as you can see on the top of this slide our guidance includes a 2019 average quarterly exchange rates of the peso which range from ars39 in the beginning of the year to ars49 at the end of the year currently the peso is at ars42 4 in line with our expectations let s move to slide 9 free cash flow our 2019 free cash flow target is 220 million up 54 million or 33 from 2018 and quadruple 2017 the increase is driven by higher ebitda and the timing of tax refunds partly offset by acquisition related restructuring costs higher interest expense and increased capital expenditures related to the dunbar and rodoban acquisitions working capital improvement will continue to be a focus and we ve challenged our business leaders to continue the dso and dpo improvement we started in 2018 we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 245 million in 2019 up from 207 million last year this includes 220 million for operating assets and 25 million for smart safes the 220 million comprised of 165 million in cash and 55 million for financing leases primarily for armored vehicles in the united states the 25 million for smart safes will be spent outside of the us as smart safes in the us are primarily operating leases we expect total cash capex to be 190 million up from 155 million in 2018 our higher capex levels in 2019 are primarily due to the dunbar and rodoban acquisitions as we ve stated previously excluding our strategy 1 0 incremental capex for high return breakthrough initiatives capex needed for acquisitions integration and our upfront investment in strategy 2 0 we expect future ongoing capex to be approximately 4 5 of revenue there is additional detail related to capex and interest expense in the appendix of this presentation as you can see at the bottom of the slide we re targeting our free cash flow conversion rate as a percentage of income to improve from 37 in 2017 to around 100 in 2019 moving on this slide illustrates our net debt and leverage position both historically and assuming synergies from completed acquisitions through 2020 if we achieve our 2019 cash flow target our net debt would be approximately 1 3 billion at the end of 2019 up 100 million from december 31 2018 as a result of approximately 150 million invested in acquisitions reduced by cash flow after dividends our pro forma leverage based on trailing 12 month fully synergized ebitda through 2020 should be around 2 turns at the end of 2019 now i ll conceptualize the fully synergized concept consider that we ve made about 1 1 billion in acquisitions since early 2017 and had generally targeted a post synergy multiple of about 6 times to 6 5 times that should result in approximately 180 million of annual ebitda moving to slide 11 when doug and i joined the company we were convinced that there was no structural difference between brink s and the most profitable cit companies as a team we developed and executed a three year plan to close the gap and results are exceeding our aggressive expectations but we ve questioned whether it makes sense to benchmark our performance against four different cit companies in four different countries today based on the common characteristics listed on this slide brink s is a route based industrial service company our growth rate in both revenue and ebitda already exceed our route based peers and far exceeds global cit companies now we re focused on closing the margin gap to explain how i ll turn it back over to doug douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks ron we re now into our final year of our three year strategic plan that we unveiled at our march 2017 investor day our strategy 1 0 which is focused on driving organic growth and margin expansion is on track to deliver 310 million of reported operating profit and 480 million of reported ebitda in 2019 despite the significant currency translation headwinds that we faced already over the last two years and which we project to continue this year with respect now this represents an organic only ebitda compound annual growth rate of around 12 and we still have a lot of runway for additional organic growth from these strategies well beyond 2019 strategy 1 5 is focused on accretive acquisitions in 2019 we expect strategy 1 5 to drive an additional 105 million of profit growth and an incremental 120 million of ebitda growth from our 10 completed acquisitions to date it s important to remember that these amounts include only partial cost synergies gained from route density infrastructure overlap and efficiency improvements in most cases it takes two years to three years to achieve all of the cost synergies from an acquisition and most of our acquisitions were completed less than 18 months ago our largest dunbar was completed less than eight months ago and we ve only owned rodoban for a little over three months when these acquisitions are fully synergized we expect to add a total of about 180 million of annual ebitda and like strategy 1 0 strategy 1 5 also has a lot of runway for growth through additional accretive acquisitions in total these strategies are expected to deliver 600 million of ebitda in 2019 representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21 over the three year plan period well ahead of our investor day 2019 target of 475 million we expect strategies 1 0 and 1 5 to continue to drive revenue and profit growth throughout the next strategic plan period as we add new breakthrough and other margin improvement initiatives and accretive acquisitions later this year we ll disclose the next layer of our plan which we call strategy 2 0 it s still in development but i can tell you that we re focused on two broad objectives the first objective is to increase share within our existing customer base by offering a broader array of high margin higher value services that expand our presence within the total cash ecosystem including tech enabled solutions and increase financial institution outsourcing our second objective is to expand our reach to serve new unvended and under vended customers within the total cash ecosystem brink s currently serves approximately a 100 000 retail locations in the us where we are the market leader and we estimate that our entire industry provides services to approximately 300 000 to 400 000 us retail locations at best to put this in perspective there are approximately 3 8 million retail locations in the us and the top 100 retailers by revenue account for less than 10 of these locations this means there are more than 3 million small to medium size retail locations in the us and that many of them are totally unvended or underserved by our industry we believe there is a huge opportunity to add new growth and new profitability by penetrating this market and by simultaneously providing new services to our existing customers for example we estimate that the smart safe and recyclers which offer high value total cash management solutions have only penetrated approximately 20 and 5 respectively of the us market we believe we can develop and offer new high margin tech enabled solutions to unvended and underserved retailers with a value proposition that is very compelling compared to currently available alternatives ultimately our strategy 2 0 challenge is to provide a full array of tech enabled services that can meet the total cash management needs of almost any retailer regardless of size to support this strategy we re investing approximately 20 million this year primarily in operating expenses to fund a variety of product it sales and marketing initiatives to accelerate the development and in introduction of our strategy this includes investment to support our customer facing app portal development and other tech enabled services it also includes spending to develop test and pilot new products and to strengthen our global sales and marketing organizations beginning in 2020 we expect the payback on these investments in the form of higher organic revenue and higher margins we also expect to spend another 10 million dollars of opex this year on it and related items to implement new internal operating systems to better support and increase productivity as well as to connect with the new customer facing technologies these costs include the rollout of oracle and salesforce workday and other systems as well as enhance cyber security as i stated upfront despite the significant negative impact of currency translation our strong first quarter supports our 2019 full year guidance we expect revenue growth of 9 and operating profit growth of 20 ebitda is expected to be up approximately 17 to the midpoint of our 600 million range and eps is expected to grow 21 to 4 20 per share at the midpoint our operating profit guidance is 415 million at the midpoint this includes 310 million of four year organic profit growth from our strategy 1 0 initiatives in the us brazil mexico france and other several other countries it also includes another 105 million of profit growth from our strategy 1 5 acquisitions our guidance includes fx rates as of the end of 2018 for all countries except argentina where we have maintained our assumption that the peso to us dollar exchange rate will average asr45 for the year based on these rates we estimate the negative currency translation impact on 2019 revenue and operating profits will be 190 million and 60 million respectively and as ron noted our guidance includes the year over year profit decline in argentina of approximately 10 million with margin recovery coming in the third quarter this closing slide illustrates the dramatic operating profit ebitda and margin increases we ve achieved over the three year strategic plan period including our 2019 guidance even with significant fx headwinds operating profit is projected to almost double from 216 million in 2016 to about 415 million at the end of 2019 ending at our midpoint this represents an approximate 24 compound annual growth rate over three years and a margin rate improvement of approximately 360 basis points to 11 before closing i wanted to take a moment to note that in a few weeks brink s will celebrate its 160th year in operation we are immensely proud of where we ve been but we re also excited about where we re going our ongoing strategy and culture evolution is the key to our continued success frankly we re looking to go beyond just incremental change and we ve already done that over the last two years and we are going we want to go beyond where our industry is today we intend to transform the industry by changing who we are and how we service our customers but we know one thing that won t change is the iconic brink s brand which symbolizes trust and gives us the calling card to expand services within our existing customer base and to approach new customers with our 2 0 strategy initiatives and beyond we also have opportunity to serve new industries that have a need for our core services for example in the fourth quarter of last year we started providing both cash and secure logistic services to canopy the largest cannabis company in canada in the us where cannabis remains illegal at the federal level millions of dollars of cash are being transported and stored without adequate security and regulatory oversight posing a significant risk to the public there are legislative efforts currently under way in the us that will authorize federally chartered banks to service this industry thus enabling brink s to provide its cash management services to us based cannabis companies let s be clear brink s is not currently servicing the us cannabis industry and we neither endorse nor oppose efforts to legalize cannabis in the us but we strongly support passage of this legislation as a matter of public safety and policy and as we did in canada we stand ready to be the first mover in providing our services in the us the outlook for our business and our industry is healthy cash in the us is growing consistently at 5 or more annually and accounts for 30 of us consumer transactions more than any other payment method in fact cash accounts for approximately 80 of global consumer transactions and in the us recent legislation and public opinion have been supportive of efforts to ensure that cash continues to be a payment option for all consumers especially those 25 to 30 of people in the us who are unbanked or underbanked even some of the largest retailers including amazon are stating publicly the importance of accepting cash in summary brink s is very well positioned to continue growing both organically and through accretive acquisitions and with our 2 0 strategy we plan to add another layer of high margin growth by offering new tech enabled solutions to current and prospective customers and finally as brink s continues to evolve we want our perception among investors to evolve as well we re closing the margin gap with our most successful competitors we re on track to deliver 20 plus percent year over year growth over our three year strategic plan period and we re confident that we ll continue to deliver similar profit growth levels in 2020 and beyond with that denise i ll pass it over to you for questions thank you operator thank you mr pertz ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and your first question this morning will be from tobey sommer of suntrust please go ahead tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you i was wondering if you could comment on the approximate contribution to revenue growth if you just look at the business from a volume and price perspective ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer you mean overall tobey tobey sommer suntrust analyst yeah overall for the company as a whole just kind of in broad strokes how would you break those two down ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer you know tobey we don t do that we often do by country which but it s awfully hard to do and we don t really capture it by even region segment or overall tobey sommer suntrust analyst okay douglas a pertz chief executive officer so we can give you tobey sommer suntrust analyst if i would shift the question and ask you to speak about the pricing climate in your major markets could we go there ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we can go there and we can give some background in some of the major markets in the us it continues to be strong i think we it s more relevant question for the fourth quarter because we generally see price increases in in the us at the latter part of the year and so basically the answer is the same we continue to see strong pricing similar to last year and the year prior to that that were implemented in the latter part of last year to continue to carry through and they are more favorable than our cost increases in general in the us we are seeing similar things in major countries in mexico where we re seeing a similar sort of situation with strong pricing brazil is probably not as strong as those markets but we re still gaining price momentum there as well argentina there s pretty good transparency i think that we provided for you in argentina and we are seeing right on track with that trend to improve the inflationary driven prices there over the recovery period that we ve laid out of about six quarters longer than historical but that s a result of what we saw particularly in this first quarter of the year over year 50 fx hit offset by partial improvements in inflationary pricing but it s right on track in argentina and probably the other major market that we always talk about is france which we re starting to see at least some relatively year over year improvement and we anticipate that improvement be marginally better as we go throughout the rest of this year that give you some background i mean i think i think if you look at this quarter on a revenue basis significant hits as a result of fx and that s had an impact for the quarter we anticipate that that will improve as we go out through the rest of this year as we stated and on top of that year over year i remember there was an impact of in excess of 20 million as a result of the sale the divestiture of our french guarding business which was in last year s numbers as well tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you in the with respect to your acquisition pipeline how would you describe the large relatively large acquisition opportunities versus recent quarters ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer leading question go ahead douglas a pertz chief executive officer the opportunities have been there for a while as we ve said in the past acquisition activity is very lumpy especially when most of the sellers are families so the timing is contingent on family dynamics that are out of our control what we do do is we have regular interaction with all the core core and core adjacent potential acquisitions and make sure that when the time is right that we re prepared to present a compelling offer that will drive value for our shareholders but there s the pipeline is bigger than it was on investor day of 2017 both in number of possible transactions and an absolute enterprise value and we are actively pursuing them with the discipline that we ve demonstrated to date tobey sommer suntrust analyst my last question just has to do with free cash flow normalization i guess if we exclude acquisitions and what that could mean to capex needs what is the timing of free cash flow normalization and when do you think it starts to emerge understanding it won t all unfold in one quarter ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so tobey that following on our last question if we were to stop doing acquisitions normalization would probably start in 2021 but i just indicated we re not planning on stopping those it s kind of hard to budget deals that haven t happened yet but if nothing else were to happen you would see that 4 5 of revenue in terms of capex kicking in around 2021 douglas a pertz chief executive officer and tobey i think that s consistent with what we said in prior quarters and calls on page 23 i think it is of the deck in the appendix is a slide that we ve used in the past that leads you to that guides you to this in the timeframe that runs talking to the 4 5 excluding obviously acquisitions and acquisitions contribute to generally higher capex as we stated the dunbar acquisition as an example over the course of the three years period of time of the implementation of synergies and integration of dunbar we ve talked to an incremental 50 million in capex spend over that period of time it also contributes from a cash flow standpoint to the restructuring charges the one time restructuring charges that hit and both those negatively impact obviously our short term free cash flow which are shown in the slides that ron presented on the cash flow in the presentation that tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you very much douglas a pertz chief executive officer these two are improvement this year but on a normalized basis both of those have materially restructuring as well as the reduced capex would lead to materially improvements in our free cash flow going forward tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you douglas a pertz chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will be from jamie clement of buckingham please go ahead james clement buckingham analyst good morning gentlemen douglas a pertz chief executive officer good morning jamie ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer hi jamie james clement buckingham analyst guys if you look at organic revenue growth in north america for the quarter give a rough breakdown of how much of that was financial institution versus retail of course you just want to talk if you want to talk qualitatively that s fine douglas a pertz chief executive officer yeah so we ll talk qualitatively and i think i ve historically said that with the improvements that we are making in our operations which have maybe taken longer than i personally would like but we are clearly seeing improvements in our operations and in our operational excellence and in our service levels and so forth that are markedly showing results to our financial institutions we are highly confident that those will result in additional business in the course of this year and therefore show up in latter part of this year and next year with financial institutions although i don t think you ve seen that in the numbers to date james clement buckingham analyst okay yeah because i think actually doug i think would you shortly after you all joined i think i asked you how long how long your service levels would have to be up to kind of prove to some large financial institutions that brink s was legit and you said it could take three years so it sounds like you are on track right douglas a pertz chief executive officer we are on track for the three years it certainly does not meet my timetable personally but i am very pleased with and i compliment our team for continuing to show the improvements in our service levels that we think are now equal to competition and i think that our financial institution our largest customers are seeing that those do make a difference and are responding to that and i think will make a difference going forward financial institutions don t necessarily move that quickly either james clement buckingham analyst right right but ron if i could switch to you as we think about the rest of the year piece of synergy realization cadence of the 20 to 30 million in investments pending is there anything we need to know about sort of the pace of growth second quarter third quarter or fourth quarter are there any timing issues we need to be aware of ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer when you re talking about several things you mentioned revenue first of all and i think that the revenue growth should be improved as we go throughout the year obviously it s going to still be choppy year over year excuse me quarter over quarter and there is seasonality as we know the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter is always better so on the revenue basis we should see some improvement as we see that going forward obviously then there s comps that come in as we start in the latter part of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter for dunbar in the us but the second part of your question it really is what about op income and the growth improvements associated with that and one of the things i pointed out in the us that the legacy us business saw tremendous improvement driven by breakthrough and other initiatives in the first quarter we should see that continue to improve as we go forward so as we ve laid out our three year plan for breakthrough initiatives whether it be in the us and mexico and other locations and countries those breakthrough initiatives will continue to improve and drive improved profitability as we go through the rest of this year throughout the quarter you ll add to that the synergies the synergies will improve and grow as we go throughout this year as well so you build on those are two big drivers for improved profitability on top of the revenues so those are margin drivers as well on a reported basis not necessarily an operational basis as we said we anticipate particularly in argentina that throughout the rest of this year particularly in the second half we will see fx year over year improvements and therefore our reported numbers will improve with that major push as well so that gives us the support and the comfort that we ll see some improved top line but more importantly better leverage and improvements in our margins for the second half of this year in particular james clement buckingham analyst and it terms of the investment spending you think you should be relatively even as the quarters go or is there any kind of build or any sort of anticipated the spike in one quarter versus another ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think the spikes might only be in line with some of the restructuring charges and that s cash spend as well as some capex spends as we go through but generally no spikes relatively through james clement buckingham analyst okay great thank you very much for your time as always ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks clement operator the next question will be from jeff kessler of imperial capital please go ahead jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay thank you for taking my question as you look at the rest of the year you ve put in place now you ve put in place now scenario in which you re going to be increasing increasing your spending by about 20 million i guess 30 million on new projects that will that will bring in a return assuming that that return begins to come in toward the end of the year into next year what are the types of things that can happen in the second half of the year i know you don t want to push this needle too far but what are the types of things that can happen in the second half of the year that could bring increased profitability to the company above and beyond what you ve been talking about today i m not looking for fantasy here i m looking for i m looking for things like we haven t talked a lot about some of the cash recycling and obviously compusafe a lot of a lot of other things that might be able to improve let s call it improved guidance as you move later on into the year ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer hey jeff let me reiterate a couple of things one of them is the the 20 million plus 10 million spending that we ve talked about on the 2 0 spend strategy the 2 0 investment as well as the 10 million in incremental spend this year on it we re spending that throughout the year so we ve already spent a portion of that we ll continue to build a little bit and spend more that s in the numbers though that s in our projections what as i said with jamie s question a moment ago we anticipate and we have built into here that that our synergies will continue to build we just we just launched we just did the first of this year rodoban and so we re just starting to see the benefits of this seen they are clearly build fairly dramatically from where it is we re just in the process now of in the second quarter and will be to latter part of the second quarter with the us in terms of the dunbar integration to start integrating our systems and therefore that s when we ll start seeing more acceleration of our synergies as a result of the dunbar acquisition in the latter part of this year again our breakthrough initiatives which contributed fairly nicely right on track in the first quarter of this year will continue to increase as we put more trucks in place we get the benefits of those we get the benefits of the rest of our breakthrough and other support initiatives to drive our core margins so all of those things have increases in our margins as we move forward those the projections and where we re going forward i think have some potential for some improvements especially depending on where fx goes and it could go one way or the other i guess but we don t have and i don t want to guide at this point in time that we re going to see an acceleration of our strategy 2 0 benefits into this year and it s nothing negative on it not at all what i m really saying is we anticipate that that will help guide us to improvements more support more growth in 2020 and beyond but we re highly confident that with our breakthrough initiatives and other initiatives that we already have part of our 1 0 with the benefits associated with the acquisition and the synergies in strategy 1 5 and the improved fx for the rest of this year that plus some revenue growth will drive us even with the investments of the strategy 2 0 jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay great douglas a pertz chief executive officer i ll add we are planning an investor day in the second half and the reason we are not doing it sooner jeff is we don t have a quantification as a lot of these aren t piled up right now and so we want to be able to accumulate the feedback from these initiatives and have a more comprehensive view that will inform our guidance going forward and look forward to more information on the timing of that investor day as the weeks go by ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer the risk being too excited about the first quarter we were very pleased with our first quarter performance being close to that 19 to 20 overall for the year that we provided guidance on even with the significant negative transnational impact of fx in argentina jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay great the second question is looking at what you re providing now to your customers in terms of both customer facing and if you want to call it more inaudible types of services you are obviously pushing toward evaluation parameter in which you re not being compared anymore against let s call it pure cash in transit competition and you wanted to be compared against route structured based recurring revenue saas oriented companies which obviously are being valued higher higher than you what are the things or the types of services that you think you need to add or at least and from the market about it if you have them and you haven t really pushed them that far that you need to create that type of the aura to be able to be get on the to have your ir and pr people talk about this is what this company does that is different than the others that we are in our old comparison so that and we can be compared against the santos ph of the world and things like that douglas a pertz chief executive officer yeah so jeff part of it is we don t think we even today we don t think we should be compared with our competition that are in a different exchange and in a different country and so forth i think what s most important is what separates us is our financial performance so far that should set us apart and should have set us closer to the industrial services companies that we ve laid out and then going forward there will be even more associated with that so to date we think if you look on page 11 and you run down that list of the comparisons versus the route based peers which i think there is a in the there is a on page 21 there s a list of some of the peers like you suggested to be look at we stack up very handsomely very nicely versus the financial results around that and then as you then start adding to that route based obviously is a key piece of this but probably more importantly is things such as strong recurring revenue streams consistent maintenance of customers and stickiness of those customers subscription based pricing that is simple for our customers that suggest we have customers for a longer period of time all of those things i think will be things to look for the tech enabled component around this we think we ll probably even be better than many of these route based or industrial services peers that is what we anticipate that you ll see going forward in the future but i d suggest you take a look at what we re already doing today if you take a look at our op income it would what i say 24 compound annual growth rate over the last three years and we re suggesting with our strategies going forward we ll at least do something in the 20 plus percent range going forward and compare that versus the peers on page 11 all of those are very strong correlations that suggest we outperform them now that we suggest that clearly outperforms our european peers directly in our space but this is really more of a direct comparison that we think should be made that s a value equation its a value creation equation and we intend to continue to provide that value to our shareholders jeff kessler imperial capital analyst great thank you very much appreciate it douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks jeff operator operator instructions the next question will be from sam england of berenberg please go ahead sam england berenberg analyst goof morning guys and first one for me could you touch on the trends you saw in labor costs in q1 in your main markets douglas a pertz chief executive officer labor costs primarily i presume you re saying in the us and inaudible ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean us is pretty flat as doug mentioned we see a lot of the price increases and labor increases in the back half of the year argentina had negotiated the regularly scheduled wage increases that happen in three phases typically 50 of the increases in july 25 in november and 25 in march this year they had a supplemental to that but we ve had a corresponding improvement in price increases to offset that basically there have been no surprises on wage increases the us labor market remains tight but that s also what is enabling the price increases in the last two years that we were unable to get in the three years prior to that so it s manageable and whenever we re able to cover higher wages in pricing it s normally a good situation for all involved sam england berenberg analyst great thanks and the next one i just wondered how the rodoban integration is going and any surprises you found now you ve got underneath that business douglas a pertz chief executive officer yeah so it s going better than expected the performance of rodoban was a positive for us in the first quarter a lot of times you don t know until you actually get behind the wheel of an acquisition and what we re finding there is very encouraging it s going to take as most acquisitions do two years to three years before we fully integrate and get all the synergies but right now i d say we re on track and we are very pleased sam england berenberg analyst okay great and then last one from me just with some of the potential m a activity that s being talked about in the market in 2019 how do you guys think about the opportunity to enter new geographies outside the ones you re already in douglas a pertz chief executive officer we ve always talked about the core core would be our first priority but core adjacent is something that is a part of strategy 1 5 and as we complete more core core acquisitions by definition that means more of the acquisitions left are core adjacent so we do look at going into other countries it s more difficult because there s less synergy as you would expect and because of that the discipline is high and then the premiums that we can pay are by definition lower so it s harder to get deals done from families and the sellers but we continue to evaluate the expansion into other countries on a regular basis sam england berenberg analyst great thanks very much that s all from me douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks sam ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks sam operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session and

president of investor relations and corporate communications mr cunningham you may begin ed cunningham vice president investor relations corporate communication advertisement advertisement thanks denise and good morning everyone joining me today are ceo doug pertz and cfo ron domanico this morning we reported first quarter results on both gaap and non gaap basis the non gaap results exclude a number of items including our venezuela operations the impact of argentina s highly inflationary accounting reorganization and restructuring costs items related to acquisitions and dispositions and costs related to certain accounting compliance modes we are also providing our results on a constant currency basis which just eliminates changes in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year we believe the non gaap results make it easier for investors to assess operating performance between periods accordingly our comments today including those referring to our guidance will focus primarily on non gaap results reconciliations of non gaap to gaap results are provided in the press release in the appendix to the slides we re using today and in this morning s 8 k filing all of which can be found on our website finally please note that the page 3 of the press release provides the details behind our 2019 guidance including revenue operating profit non controlling interest income taxes and adjusted ebitda i ll now turn the call over to doug advertisement advertisement douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks ed good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today we reported strong first quarter results including a 19 increase in non gaap operating profit these results were heavily driven by continued profit momentum in the us and mexico easily offsetting the 10 million profit decline that we expected in argentina due to currency translation in constant currency operating profit and eps were up 50 and 59 respectively first quarter results support our full year guidance which targets operating profit growth of 20 despite the expected persistence of currency headwinds our full year guidance also includes approximately 20 million to 30 million of increased operating expenses to support our new strategic initiatives and it expenditures as we move through the next three quarters of 2019 we expect organic growth initiatives and acquisition related synergies to drive profit growth across all segments we also expect the negative impact of currency translation to diminish over the next three quarters as inflation driven price increases should exceed projected devaluation in argentina together these factors support an expected increase of 100 basis points in full year margin rate to approximately 11 with an ebitda margin rate of over 16 in a few minutes i ll review our guidance in more detail along with some comments about our strategies to drive continued organic and acquisition related growth i ll also discuss our plans to introduce our next layer of our growth strategy but i ll summarize our first quarter results first first quarter earnings per share increased 16 on an organic revenue growth of 6 the operating profit growth of 19 reflects a margin rate increase of 100 basis points to 9 4 and an adjusted ebitda rose 20 or 22 million to 132 million in the quarter we achieved these results despite negative currency translation that reduced our earnings by 0 29 per share while the dollar strengthened against most currencies most of the unfavorable fx impact was in argentina where strong local currency growth was more than offset by the approximate 50 devaluation in the peso that drove a year over year operating profit decline of 10 million advertisement advertisement the fact that we reported strong overall earnings growth of 19 i think is a testament to the successful execution of our strategy we continue to believe that our true operating performance is probably best illustrated by evaluating our results on a local currency basis in constant currency revenue was up 17 profit growth was 50 adjusted ebitda was up 42 and eps was up 59 this strong start to 2019 supports our full year guidance and keeps us on a track that is well ahead of our initial three year strategic plan targets it s clear that our strategy to drive profitable growth both organically and through acquisitions is working and we still have great opportunities to accelerate momentum we ve already achieved before turning over to ron i want to discuss the us and its efforts to improve margins in our core legacy business and integration of the dunbar acquisition both of these initiatives are going well our us business was the single biggest driver in their first quarter both in terms of revenue and profit growth it s also our current single greatest opportunities to drive future value creation first quarter us revenues grew 53 to 297 million due primarily to the addition of dunbar which was not part of brink s in last year s first quarter this year s first quarter revenue in our legacy us business was up 4 5 us operating profit for the quarter increased more than 200 half from the acquired dunbar business and half from our legacy breakthrough initiatives and synergies this reflects a doubling of our overall us margin rate to 8 1 versus 4 1 last year which includes a 50 plus percent organic margin rate improvement in our legacy business our integration efforts are ahead of schedule and our us operations are on track to achieve our targeted 2019 exit margin rate of approximately 10 looking ahead we are on track to deliver at least 45 million of growth excuse me a profit growth through cost synergies by 2021 or sooner and as we disclosed earlier this year our us business is targeting a margin rate of 13 by the end of 2021 on a revenue base that we expect to exceed 1 3 billion advertisement advertisement the increase in our us margins to 13 from 6 8 last year will be driven by continued organic improvement from our breakthrough and other initiatives and supplemented by the dunbar acquisition synergies now i ll turn it over to ron to review our financials ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks doug and good day everyone today in the united states is administrative assistants day and doug and i want to recognize kim harsha ph and tracy wright ph for their amazing support i ll start with our first quarter results beginning on the left side of slide 7 first quarter revenue grew 6 which included 48 million of organic growth and 100 million from the acquisitions completed over the last 12 months most notably dunbar in the united states and rodoban in brazil advertisement advertisement organic revenue growth in north america was 6 a 400 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2018 south america organic revenue continued its double digit trend growing 12 rest of world revenue was flat on an organic basis and was impacted by the loss of 21 million of revenue from the disposition of our french aviation guarding business in the second quarter of 2018 and negative forex total negative forex translation reduced revenue by 97 million driven primarily by the steep devaluation of the argentine peso and to a lesser degree the brazilian real and the euro first quarter operating profit rose 19 to 85 million despite strong currency headwinds organic profit growth of 23 million or 32 was driven primarily by the us mexico and argentina this growth was supplemented by 13 million from the dunbar and rodoban acquisitions generating a 50 constant currency operating profit growth that doug referenced our consolidated operating profit margin was up 100 bps to 9 4 despite 22 million of negative translation forex for perspective it s interesting to note that in the first quarter of 2016 operating profit was 34 million with over 70 generated by south america and less than 12 from north america three years later in the first quarter of 2019 operating profit at 85 million was 2 5 times greater and north america contributed 52 the operating profit margin of our north america segment increased 370 bps to 10 1 led by mexico which is well ahead of its three year plan 2019 target of 15 our south american operations are performing well on a local currency basis excluding the impact of forex constant currency operating profit was up 17 led by argentina and chile organic operating profit in the segment grew by 9 the rest of the world profit margin increased 70 bps to 9 9 the recovery of our legacy french operations and the continued integration of temis generated positive profit growth versus the first quarter of 2018 separately the pending acquisition by loomis of prosegur s operations in france may provide opportunities to grow our business in that country advertisement advertisement first quarter corporate expenses decreased 4 million lower security costs and currency translation gains were partially offset by higher non cash equity based compensation and strategy 2 0 related marketing and product costs for the full year including 20 million to 30 million of investments in strategy 2 0 and it initiatives we expect corporate expenses to be approximately 130 million with about 35 million from non cash share based compensation an increase of about 10 million versus 2018 now let s discuss argentina argentina is an important business for brink s and our management team is doing an exceptional job of operating in a challenging highly inflationary environment the bars on top of this slide show the negative impact on reported operating profit in us dollars due to the devaluation of the argentine peso the forecasted peso to us dollar exchange rate for 2019 is shown on the top of each bar and the rate for 2018 is below each bar bars at the bottom of the slide illustrate the year over year change and brink s argentina operating profit in us dollars negative variances are in red and positive variances are in green in the first quarter 2019 versus the same period last year the devaluation of the peso had a negative impact of 19 million on reported profit inflation driven price increases operational improvements and additional maco synergies offset about half of this impact and our reported us dollar operating profit was down by 10 million as we move through 2019 we expect the peso to continue to devalue but the impact of that devaluation should diminish each quarter versus prior year comparisons for the full year in argentina we expect a negative forex impact of about 55 million for reported operating profit for the remaining three quarters of 2019 we expect that our continued local currency momentum will fully offset devaluation said differently we expect argentina 2019 full year us dollar operating profit to be approximately 10 million less than it was in 2018 advertisement advertisement as you can see on the top of this slide our guidance includes a 2019 average quarterly exchange rates of the peso which range from ars39 in the beginning of the year to ars49 at the end of the year currently the peso is at ars42 4 in line with our expectations let s move to slide 9 free cash flow our 2019 free cash flow target is 220 million up 54 million or 33 from 2018 and quadruple 2017 the increase is driven by higher ebitda and the timing of tax refunds partly offset by acquisition related restructuring costs higher interest expense and increased capital expenditures related to the dunbar and rodoban acquisitions working capital improvement will continue to be a focus and we ve challenged our business leaders to continue the dso and dpo improvement we started in 2018 we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately 245 million in 2019 up from 207 million last year this includes 220 million for operating assets and 25 million for smart safes the 220 million comprised of 165 million in cash and 55 million for financing leases primarily for armored vehicles in the united states the 25 million for smart safes will be spent outside of the us as smart safes in the us are primarily operating leases we expect total cash capex to be 190 million up from 155 million in 2018 our higher capex levels in 2019 are primarily due to the dunbar and rodoban acquisitions as we ve stated previously excluding our strategy 1 0 incremental capex for high return breakthrough initiatives capex needed for acquisitions integration and our upfront investment in strategy 2 0 we expect future ongoing capex to be approximately 4 5 of revenue there is additional detail related to capex and interest expense in the appendix of this presentation as you can see at the bottom of the slide we re targeting our free cash flow conversion rate as a percentage of income to improve from 37 in 2017 to around 100 in 2019 moving on this slide illustrates our net debt and leverage position both historically and assuming synergies from completed acquisitions through 2020 if we achieve our 2019 cash flow target our net debt would be approximately 1 3 billion at the end of 2019 up 100 million from december 31 2018 as a result of approximately 150 million invested in acquisitions reduced by cash flow after dividends our pro forma leverage based on trailing 12 month fully synergized ebitda through 2020 should be around 2 turns at the end of 2019 advertisement advertisement now i ll conceptualize the fully synergized concept consider that we ve made about 1 1 billion in acquisitions since early 2017 and had generally targeted a post synergy multiple of about 6 times to 6 5 times that should result in approximately 180 million of annual ebitda moving to slide 11 when doug and i joined the company we were convinced that there was no structural difference between brink s and the most profitable cit companies as a team we developed and executed a three year plan to close the gap and results are exceeding our aggressive expectations but we ve questioned whether it makes sense to benchmark our performance against four different cit companies in four different countries today based on the common characteristics listed on this slide brink s is a route based industrial service company our growth rate in both revenue and ebitda already exceed our route based peers and far exceeds global cit companies now we re focused on closing the margin gap to explain how i ll turn it back over to doug douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks ron we re now into our final year of our three year strategic plan that we unveiled at our march 2017 investor day our strategy 1 0 which is focused on driving organic growth and margin expansion is on track to deliver 310 million of reported operating profit and 480 million of reported ebitda in 2019 despite the significant currency translation headwinds that we faced already over the last two years and which we project to continue this year with respect now this represents an organic only ebitda compound annual growth rate of around 12 and we still have a lot of runway for additional organic growth from these strategies well beyond 2019 strategy 1 5 is focused on accretive acquisitions in 2019 we expect strategy 1 5 to drive an additional 105 million of profit growth and an incremental 120 million of ebitda growth from our 10 completed acquisitions to date it s important to remember that these amounts include only partial cost synergies gained from route density infrastructure overlap and efficiency improvements in most cases it takes two years to three years to achieve all of the cost synergies from an acquisition and most of our acquisitions were completed less than 18 months ago our largest dunbar was completed less than eight months ago and we ve only owned rodoban for a little over three months when these acquisitions are fully synergized we expect to add a total of about 180 million of annual ebitda and like strategy 1 0 strategy 1 5 also has a lot of runway for growth through additional accretive acquisitions in total these strategies are expected to deliver 600 million of ebitda in 2019 representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21 over the three year plan period well ahead of our investor day 2019 target of 475 million we expect strategies 1 0 and 1 5 to continue to drive revenue and profit growth throughout the next strategic plan period as we add new breakthrough and other margin improvement initiatives and accretive acquisitions later this year we ll disclose the next layer of our plan which we call strategy 2 0 it s still in development but i can tell you that we re focused on two broad objectives the first objective is to increase share within our existing customer base by offering a broader array of high margin higher value services that expand our presence within the total cash ecosystem including tech enabled solutions and increase financial institution outsourcing our second objective is to expand our reach to serve new unvended and under vended customers within the total cash ecosystem brink s currently serves approximately a 100 000 retail locations in the us where we are the market leader and we estimate that our entire industry provides services to approximately 300 000 to 400 000 us retail locations at best to put this in perspective there are approximately 3 8 million retail locations in the us and the top 100 retailers by revenue account for less than 10 of these locations this means there are more than 3 million small to medium size retail locations in the us and that many of them are totally unvended or underserved by our industry we believe there is a huge opportunity to add new growth and new profitability by penetrating this market and by simultaneously providing new services to our existing customers for example we estimate that the smart safe and recyclers which offer high value total cash management solutions have only penetrated approximately 20 and 5 respectively of the us market we believe we can develop and offer new high margin tech enabled solutions to unvended and underserved retailers with a value proposition that is very compelling compared to currently available alternatives ultimately our strategy 2 0 challenge is to provide a full array of tech enabled services that can meet the total cash management needs of almost any retailer regardless of size to support this strategy we re investing approximately 20 million this year primarily in operating expenses to fund a variety of product it sales and marketing initiatives to accelerate the development and in introduction of our strategy this includes investment to support our customer facing app portal development and other tech enabled services it also includes spending to develop test and pilot new products and to strengthen our global sales and marketing organizations beginning in 2020 we expect the payback on these investments in the form of higher organic revenue and higher margins we also expect to spend another 10 million dollars of opex this year on it and related items to implement new internal operating systems to better support and increase productivity as well as to connect with the new customer facing technologies these costs include the rollout of oracle and salesforce workday and other systems as well as enhance cyber security as i stated upfront despite the significant negative impact of currency translation our strong first quarter supports our 2019 full year guidance we expect revenue growth of 9 and operating profit growth of 20 ebitda is expected to be up approximately 17 to the midpoint of our 600 million range and eps is expected to grow 21 to 4 20 per share at the midpoint our operating profit guidance is 415 million at the midpoint this includes 310 million of four year organic profit growth from our strategy 1 0 initiatives in the us brazil mexico france and other several other countries it also includes another 105 million of profit growth from our strategy 1 5 acquisitions our guidance includes fx rates as of the end of 2018 for all countries except argentina where we have maintained our assumption that the peso to us dollar exchange rate will average asr45 for the year based on these rates we estimate the negative currency translation impact on 2019 revenue and operating profits will be 190 million and 60 million respectively and as ron noted our guidance includes the year over year profit decline in argentina of approximately 10 million with margin recovery coming in the third quarter this closing slide illustrates the dramatic operating profit ebitda and margin increases we ve achieved over the three year strategic plan period including our 2019 guidance even with significant fx headwinds operating profit is projected to almost double from 216 million in 2016 to about 415 million at the end of 2019 ending at our midpoint this represents an approximate 24 compound annual growth rate over three years and a margin rate improvement of approximately 360 basis points to 11 before closing i wanted to take a moment to note that in a few weeks brink s will celebrate its 160th year in operation we are immensely proud of where we ve been but we re also excited about where we re going our ongoing strategy and culture evolution is the key to our continued success frankly we re looking to go beyond just incremental change and we ve already done that over the last two years and we are going we want to go beyond where our industry is today we intend to transform the industry by changing who we are and how we service our customers but we know one thing that won t change is the iconic brink s brand which symbolizes trust and gives us the calling card to expand services within our existing customer base and to approach new customers with our 2 0 strategy initiatives and beyond we also have opportunity to serve new industries that have a need for our core services for example in the fourth quarter of last year we started providing both cash and secure logistic services to canopy the largest cannabis company in canada in the us where cannabis remains illegal at the federal level millions of dollars of cash are being transported and stored without adequate security and regulatory oversight posing a significant risk to the public there are legislative efforts currently under way in the us that will authorize federally chartered banks to service this industry thus enabling brink s to provide its cash management services to us based cannabis companies let s be clear brink s is not currently servicing the us cannabis industry and we neither endorse nor oppose efforts to legalize cannabis in the us but we strongly support passage of this legislation as a matter of public safety and policy and as we did in canada we stand ready to be the first mover in providing our services in the us the outlook for our business and our industry is healthy cash in the us is growing consistently at 5 or more annually and accounts for 30 of us consumer transactions more than any other payment method in fact cash accounts for approximately 80 of global consumer transactions and in the us recent legislation and public opinion have been supportive of efforts to ensure that cash continues to be a payment option for all consumers especially those 25 to 30 of people in the us who are unbanked or underbanked even some of the largest retailers including amazon are stating publicly the importance of accepting cash in summary brink s is very well positioned to continue growing both organically and through accretive acquisitions and with our 2 0 strategy we plan to add another layer of high margin growth by offering new tech enabled solutions to current and prospective customers and finally as brink s continues to evolve we want our perception among investors to evolve as well we re closing the margin gap with our most successful competitors we re on track to deliver 20 plus percent year over year growth over our three year strategic plan period and we re confident that we ll continue to deliver similar profit growth levels in 2020 and beyond with that denise i ll pass it over to you for questions thank you operator thank you mr pertz ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and your first question this morning will be from tobey sommer of suntrust please go ahead tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you i was wondering if you could comment on the approximate contribution to revenue growth if you just look at the business from a volume and price perspective ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer you mean overall tobey tobey sommer suntrust analyst yeah overall for the company as a whole just kind of in broad strokes how would you break those two down ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer you know tobey we don t do that we often do by country which but it s awfully hard to do and we don t really capture it by even region segment or overall tobey sommer suntrust analyst okay douglas a pertz chief executive officer so we can give you tobey sommer suntrust analyst if i would shift the question and ask you to speak about the pricing climate in your major markets could we go there ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we can go there and we can give some background in some of the major markets in the us it continues to be strong i think we it s more relevant question for the fourth quarter because we generally see price increases in in the us at the latter part of the year and so basically the answer is the same we continue to see strong pricing similar to last year and the year prior to that that were implemented in the latter part of last year to continue to carry through and they are more favorable than our cost increases in general in the us we are seeing similar things in major countries in mexico where we re seeing a similar sort of situation with strong pricing brazil is probably not as strong as those markets but we re still gaining price momentum there as well argentina there s pretty good transparency i think that we provided for you in argentina and we are seeing right on track with that trend to improve the inflationary driven prices there over the recovery period that we ve laid out of about six quarters longer than historical but that s a result of what we saw particularly in this first quarter of the year over year 50 fx hit offset by partial improvements in inflationary pricing but it s right on track in argentina and probably the other major market that we always talk about is france which we re starting to see at least some relatively year over year improvement and we anticipate that improvement be marginally better as we go throughout the rest of this year that give you some background i mean i think i think if you look at this quarter on a revenue basis significant hits as a result of fx and that s had an impact for the quarter we anticipate that that will improve as we go out through the rest of this year as we stated and on top of that year over year i remember there was an impact of in excess of 20 million as a result of the sale the divestiture of our french guarding business which was in last year s numbers as well tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you in the with respect to your acquisition pipeline how would you describe the large relatively large acquisition opportunities versus recent quarters ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer leading question go ahead douglas a pertz chief executive officer the opportunities have been there for a while as we ve said in the past acquisition activity is very lumpy especially when most of the sellers are families so the timing is contingent on family dynamics that are out of our control what we do do is we have regular interaction with all the core core and core adjacent potential acquisitions and make sure that when the time is right that we re prepared to present a compelling offer that will drive value for our shareholders but there s the pipeline is bigger than it was on investor day of 2017 both in number of possible transactions and an absolute enterprise value and we are actively pursuing them with the discipline that we ve demonstrated to date tobey sommer suntrust analyst my last question just has to do with free cash flow normalization i guess if we exclude acquisitions and what that could mean to capex needs what is the timing of free cash flow normalization and when do you think it starts to emerge understanding it won t all unfold in one quarter ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so tobey that following on our last question if we were to stop doing acquisitions normalization would probably start in 2021 but i just indicated we re not planning on stopping those it s kind of hard to budget deals that haven t happened yet but if nothing else were to happen you would see that 4 5 of revenue in terms of capex kicking in around 2021 douglas a pertz chief executive officer and tobey i think that s consistent with what we said in prior quarters and calls on page 23 i think it is of the deck in the appendix is a slide that we ve used in the past that leads you to that guides you to this in the timeframe that runs talking to the 4 5 excluding obviously acquisitions and acquisitions contribute to generally higher capex as we stated the dunbar acquisition as an example over the course of the three years period of time of the implementation of synergies and integration of dunbar we ve talked to an incremental 50 million in capex spend over that period of time it also contributes from a cash flow standpoint to the restructuring charges the one time restructuring charges that hit and both those negatively impact obviously our short term free cash flow which are shown in the slides that ron presented on the cash flow in the presentation that tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you very much douglas a pertz chief executive officer these two are improvement this year but on a normalized basis both of those have materially restructuring as well as the reduced capex would lead to materially improvements in our free cash flow going forward tobey sommer suntrust analyst thank you douglas a pertz chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will be from jamie clement of buckingham please go ahead james clement buckingham analyst good morning gentlemen douglas a pertz chief executive officer good morning jamie ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer hi jamie james clement buckingham analyst guys if you look at organic revenue growth in north america for the quarter give a rough breakdown of how much of that was financial institution versus retail of course you just want to talk if you want to talk qualitatively that s fine douglas a pertz chief executive officer yeah so we ll talk qualitatively and i think i ve historically said that with the improvements that we are making in our operations which have maybe taken longer than i personally would like but we are clearly seeing improvements in our operations and in our operational excellence and in our service levels and so forth that are markedly showing results to our financial institutions we are highly confident that those will result in additional business in the course of this year and therefore show up in latter part of this year and next year with financial institutions although i don t think you ve seen that in the numbers to date james clement buckingham analyst okay yeah because i think actually doug i think would you shortly after you all joined i think i asked you how long how long your service levels would have to be up to kind of prove to some large financial institutions that brink s was legit and you said it could take three years so it sounds like you are on track right douglas a pertz chief executive officer we are on track for the three years it certainly does not meet my timetable personally but i am very pleased with and i compliment our team for continuing to show the improvements in our service levels that we think are now equal to competition and i think that our financial institution our largest customers are seeing that those do make a difference and are responding to that and i think will make a difference going forward financial institutions don t necessarily move that quickly either james clement buckingham analyst right right but ron if i could switch to you as we think about the rest of the year piece of synergy realization cadence of the 20 to 30 million in investments pending is there anything we need to know about sort of the pace of growth second quarter third quarter or fourth quarter are there any timing issues we need to be aware of ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer when you re talking about several things you mentioned revenue first of all and i think that the revenue growth should be improved as we go throughout the year obviously it s going to still be choppy year over year excuse me quarter over quarter and there is seasonality as we know the second half of the year particularly the fourth quarter is always better so on the revenue basis we should see some improvement as we see that going forward obviously then there s comps that come in as we start in the latter part of the third quarter and in the fourth quarter for dunbar in the us but the second part of your question it really is what about op income and the growth improvements associated with that and one of the things i pointed out in the us that the legacy us business saw tremendous improvement driven by breakthrough and other initiatives in the first quarter we should see that continue to improve as we go forward so as we ve laid out our three year plan for breakthrough initiatives whether it be in the us and mexico and other locations and countries those breakthrough initiatives will continue to improve and drive improved profitability as we go through the rest of this year throughout the quarter you ll add to that the synergies the synergies will improve and grow as we go throughout this year as well so you build on those are two big drivers for improved profitability on top of the revenues so those are margin drivers as well on a reported basis not necessarily an operational basis as we said we anticipate particularly in argentina that throughout the rest of this year particularly in the second half we will see fx year over year improvements and therefore our reported numbers will improve with that major push as well so that gives us the support and the comfort that we ll see some improved top line but more importantly better leverage and improvements in our margins for the second half of this year in particular james clement buckingham analyst and it terms of the investment spending you think you should be relatively even as the quarters go or is there any kind of build or any sort of anticipated the spike in one quarter versus another ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think the spikes might only be in line with some of the restructuring charges and that s cash spend as well as some capex spends as we go through but generally no spikes relatively through james clement buckingham analyst okay great thank you very much for your time as always ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks clement operator the next question will be from jeff kessler of imperial capital please go ahead jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay thank you for taking my question as you look at the rest of the year you ve put in place now you ve put in place now scenario in which you re going to be increasing increasing your spending by about 20 million i guess 30 million on new projects that will that will bring in a return assuming that that return begins to come in toward the end of the year into next year what are the types of things that can happen in the second half of the year i know you don t want to push this needle too far but what are the types of things that can happen in the second half of the year that could bring increased profitability to the company above and beyond what you ve been talking about today i m not looking for fantasy here i m looking for i m looking for things like we haven t talked a lot about some of the cash recycling and obviously compusafe a lot of a lot of other things that might be able to improve let s call it improved guidance as you move later on into the year ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer hey jeff let me reiterate a couple of things one of them is the the 20 million plus 10 million spending that we ve talked about on the 2 0 spend strategy the 2 0 investment as well as the 10 million in incremental spend this year on it we re spending that throughout the year so we ve already spent a portion of that we ll continue to build a little bit and spend more that s in the numbers though that s in our projections what as i said with jamie s question a moment ago we anticipate and we have built into here that that our synergies will continue to build we just we just launched we just did the first of this year rodoban and so we re just starting to see the benefits of this seen they are clearly build fairly dramatically from where it is we re just in the process now of in the second quarter and will be to latter part of the second quarter with the us in terms of the dunbar integration to start integrating our systems and therefore that s when we ll start seeing more acceleration of our synergies as a result of the dunbar acquisition in the latter part of this year again our breakthrough initiatives which contributed fairly nicely right on track in the first quarter of this year will continue to increase as we put more trucks in place we get the benefits of those we get the benefits of the rest of our breakthrough and other support initiatives to drive our core margins so all of those things have increases in our margins as we move forward those the projections and where we re going forward i think have some potential for some improvements especially depending on where fx goes and it could go one way or the other i guess but we don t have and i don t want to guide at this point in time that we re going to see an acceleration of our strategy 2 0 benefits into this year and it s nothing negative on it not at all what i m really saying is we anticipate that that will help guide us to improvements more support more growth in 2020 and beyond but we re highly confident that with our breakthrough initiatives and other initiatives that we already have part of our 1 0 with the benefits associated with the acquisition and the synergies in strategy 1 5 and the improved fx for the rest of this year that plus some revenue growth will drive us even with the investments of the strategy 2 0 jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay great douglas a pertz chief executive officer i ll add we are planning an investor day in the second half and the reason we are not doing it sooner jeff is we don t have a quantification as a lot of these aren t piled up right now and so we want to be able to accumulate the feedback from these initiatives and have a more comprehensive view that will inform our guidance going forward and look forward to more information on the timing of that investor day as the weeks go by ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer the risk being too excited about the first quarter we were very pleased with our first quarter performance being close to that 19 to 20 overall for the year that we provided guidance on even with the significant negative transnational impact of fx in argentina jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay great the second question is looking at what you re providing now to your customers in terms of both customer facing and if you want to call it more inaudible types of services you are obviously pushing toward evaluation parameter in which you re not being compared anymore against let s call it pure cash in transit competition and you wanted to be compared against route structured based recurring revenue saas oriented companies which obviously are being valued higher higher than you what are the things or the types of services that you think you need to add or at least and from the market about it if you have them and you haven t really pushed them that far that you need to create that type of the aura to be able to be get on the to have your ir and pr people talk about this is what this company does that is different than the others that we are in our old comparison so that and we can be compared against the santos ph of the world and things like that douglas a pertz chief executive officer yeah so jeff part of it is we don t think we even today we don t think we should be compared with our competition that are in a different exchange and in a different country and so forth i think what s most important is what separates us is our financial performance so far that should set us apart and should have set us closer to the industrial services companies that we ve laid out and then going forward there will be even more associated with that so to date we think if you look on page 11 and you run down that list of the comparisons versus the route based peers which i think there is a in the there is a on page 21 there s a list of some of the peers like you suggested to be look at we stack up very handsomely very nicely versus the financial results around that and then as you then start adding to that route based obviously is a key piece of this but probably more importantly is things such as strong recurring revenue streams consistent maintenance of customers and stickiness of those customers subscription based pricing that is simple for our customers that suggest we have customers for a longer period of time all of those things i think will be things to look for the tech enabled component around this we think we ll probably even be better than many of these route based or industrial services peers that is what we anticipate that you ll see going forward in the future but i d suggest you take a look at what we re already doing today if you take a look at our op income it would what i say 24 compound annual growth rate over the last three years and we re suggesting with our strategies going forward we ll at least do something in the 20 plus percent range going forward and compare that versus the peers on page 11 all of those are very strong correlations that suggest we outperform them now that we suggest that clearly outperforms our european peers directly in our space but this is really more of a direct comparison that we think should be made that s a value equation its a value creation equation and we intend to continue to provide that value to our shareholders jeff kessler imperial capital analyst great thank you very much appreciate it douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks jeff operator operator instructions the next question will be from sam england of berenberg please go ahead sam england berenberg analyst goof morning guys and first one for me could you touch on the trends you saw in labor costs in q1 in your main markets douglas a pertz chief executive officer labor costs primarily i presume you re saying in the us and inaudible ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean us is pretty flat as doug mentioned we see a lot of the price increases and labor increases in the back half of the year argentina had negotiated the regularly scheduled wage increases that happen in three phases typically 50 of the increases in july 25 in november and 25 in march this year they had a supplemental to that but we ve had a corresponding improvement in price increases to offset that basically there have been no surprises on wage increases the us labor market remains tight but that s also what is enabling the price increases in the last two years that we were unable to get in the three years prior to that so it s manageable and whenever we re able to cover higher wages in pricing it s normally a good situation for all involved sam england berenberg analyst great thanks and the next one i just wondered how the rodoban integration is going and any surprises you found now you ve got underneath that business douglas a pertz chief executive officer yeah so it s going better than expected the performance of rodoban was a positive for us in the first quarter a lot of times you don t know until you actually get behind the wheel of an acquisition and what we re finding there is very encouraging it s going to take as most acquisitions do two years to three years before we fully integrate and get all the synergies but right now i d say we re on track and we are very pleased sam england berenberg analyst okay great and then last one from me just with some of the potential m a activity that s being talked about in the market in 2019 how do you guys think about the opportunity to enter new geographies outside the ones you re already in douglas a pertz chief executive officer we ve always talked about the core core would be our first priority but core adjacent is something that is a part of strategy 1 5 and as we complete more core core acquisitions by definition that means more of the acquisitions left are core adjacent so we do look at going into other countries it s more difficult because there s less synergy as you would expect and because of that the discipline is high and then the premiums that we can pay are by definition lower so it s harder to get deals done from families and the sellers but we continue to evaluate the expansion into other countries on a regular basis sam england berenberg analyst great thanks very much that s all from me douglas a pertz chief executive officer thanks sam ronald j domanico executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks sam operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session and

new delhi surging global oil prices will pose a first big challenge to india s new government whoever wins an election now under way especially as domestic prices have been allowed to lag meaning consumers are in for a painful surge as they catch up for oil import dependent india higher global prices could lead to a weaker rupee higher inflation the ruling out of interest rate cuts and could further weigh on twin current account and budget deficits economists warned but compounding the future pain state run fuel suppliers and retailers have held off passing on to consumers the higher prices during a staggered general election which began on april 11 and ends on may 23 according to sources familiar with the situation that delay is expected to be unwound once the election is over and there could be additional price increases to make up for losses or profits missed during the period of delayed increases the sources said in some major asian countries such as japan and south korea pump prices are adjusted periodically so they move largely in tandem with international crude prices that was what was supposed to happen in india but the election means there have been many days when pump prices have been unchanged in new delhi for example while crude oil prices have gone up by nearly usd 9 a barrel or about 12 per cent in the past six weeks gasoline prices have only risen by 0 47 rupees a litre or 0 6 per cent state controlled fuel suppliers and retailers declined to say why they had delayed price increases or discuss whether there has been any pressure from the government of prime minister narendra modi a government spokesman declined to comment the opposition congress party said modi s government was violating its own policy of daily price revision by advising the state oil companies to hold prices steady the government should cut fuel taxes otherwise consumers will have to pay much higher oil prices once the elections are over said akhilesh pratap singh a senior leader of the congress party nitin goyal treasurer at the all india petroleum dealers association representing fuel stations in 25 states said prices were similarly held down for 19 days in the southern state of karnataka last year when it held state assembly elections only for them to surge after the vote consumers should be ready for a rude shock of a massive jump in retail prices similar to the level we have seen in the karnataka state election goyal said credit negative sri paravaikkarasu director for asia oil at singapore based consultancy fge said retail prices of gasoline and gasoil prices would have been up to 6 per cent or about 4 rupee higher if they had been allowed to rise in line with global prices indian pump prices have failed to keep up with the recent uptrend in crude prices paravaikkarasu said with the country s general elections underway the incumbent government has been keeping pump prices relatively unchanged india had switched to a daily price revision in june 2017 from a revision every two weeks as the government allowed retailers to set prices but the government faced protests last october when retailers raised prices by up to 10 rupees a litre after the crude oil price went above usd 80 a barrel forcing it to cut fuel taxes global prices rose to their highest level in 2019 on thursday days after the united states announced all iran sanction waivers would end by may pressuring importers including india to stop buying tehran s oil higher oil prices will mean asia s third largest economy is likely to see growth of less than 7 per cent rate this fiscal year economists said growth slowed to 6 6 per cent in the october december quarter the slowest in five quarters rating agency care has warned that a 10 percent rise in global oil prices could increase demand for dollars putting pressure on the rupee and widening the current account deficit india s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending march 31 to usd 140 5 billion against usd 108 billion the previous year the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy icra the indian arm of the fitch rating agency said in a note every usd 10 per bbl increase in crude oil prices increases the fiscal deficit by about 0 1 per cent of gdp any big price rise would also build a case for the central bank to keep rates steady or even raise them the reserve bank of india s monetary policy committee which cut the benchmark policy repo rate by 25 basis points this month warned that rising oil and food prices could push up inflation policymakers are worried that a sustained increase in the oil price in the range of usd 70 75 per barrel or higher can move the rupee down by 3 4 per cent on an annual basis the rupee has depreciated by 1 24 per cent against the dollar since a year high in mid march

and up 6 on a constant exchange and days basis our adjusted operating income for the period was 207 million or 8 5 of sales in a difficult environment which we anticipate improving the us dollar strengthened significantly versus the prior year reducing our translated results for the period during the period the economies were softer in most of our regions housing markets were weaker and material and energy costs escalated around the world uneven demand impacted volume increasing pressure on pricing and mix as competition increased to align our inventories with demand we reduced

call over to chris w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer thank you jeff for the quarter our global ceramic segment sales increased about 2 5 as reported and were up about 7 on a constant days and exchange rate our operating income was about 90 million or 10 of sales including the acquisition of eliane and headwinds from slower markets pricing pressures and inflation in the us the ceramic industry faced continued pressure from lvt as well as imports from a stronger dollar a group of ceramic tiles has recently filed dumping claims against china the largest ceramic exporter to the us if confirmed tariffs could significantly increase the delivery cost of chinese imports and change competitive pressures due to earlier interest rate increases us home sales and construction slowed although both have recently improved as mortgage rates declined to enhance our position we have begun many initiatives across the business to cover inflation and transportation we implemented price increases across many categories to compete with imports we ve begun offering private label programs and are shipping direct truckloads to reduce the delivery costs we ve improved service to our customers with new mobile systems to make ordering and picking up faster and easier we are enhancing our value proposition with unique features such as slip resistance greater durability and bacteria

porcelain and large sizes and have began producing wall tile for the us market which replaces other sourced products to support higher sales we have restarted an existing production line that was idled new investments in brazil will expand our porcelain production by the first part of 2020 we have reviewed best practices between eliane and our other ceramic businesses and we are implementing improvements across all groups the european ceramic industry has weakened with the regional economies competition in the market has increased and is pressuring industry pricing we believe we have grown our market share in this environment our sales were driven by commercial outdoor and porcelain slab products as well as higher styled mid price offerings during the period we temporarily lowered our production rates to reduce our inventory we are realigning the production in our european plants and reducing staffing to improve our costs distribution and service we have consolidated management to increase our productivity reengineered our formulations and refined our maintenance processes to reduce transportation expenses and enhance service we have reorganized our eastern european logistics systems with new warehouses and technology we are investing in energy saving initiatives and adding cogeneration to improve cost this year our russian ceramic business is gaining momentum

reflecting the 2018 mortgage increases and more severe weather conditions the business improved as we moved into the second quarter supported by higher retail activity and an improving housing environment as expected operating income for the segment declined due to lower volume inventory reductions higher material costs and lvt manufacturing variances across the segment we are taking many actions to improve our sales cost and margins to address changing consumer preferences our new residential carpet introductions included more blended multi colored collections and sophisticated patterns our new colormax technology which blends earth tones was voted the best carpet innovation at the national show as polyester products gained share we have differentiated our continuum collections with enhanced color visuals the carpet price increases we ve implemented are being partially offset by declining product mix to ensure that each of our products in the market is priced properly we have instituted better practices and controls we ve replaced high cost assets and are consolidating four inefficient operations which will reduce our overhead and cost structures we are enhancing planning strategies increasing production outputs and reducing process variations to facilitate this realignment these actions are being completed with additional improvements are being

substantially improve our output and costs throughout the year most of these changes have already been proven in our european operations and we are confident in our long term position for the quarter our flooring rest of world segment sales were up 6 as reported and up 16 on a constant days and currency basis our adjusted operating income for this segment was about 95 million or 15 3 of sales up 11 on a local basis including our acquisitions the economies in europe and australia new zealand have been slowing putting pressure on our revenues and margins in this climate we outperformed in most of our businesses we have been increasing prices on selected products to offset inflation and currency changes we are expanding both our residential and commercial sales organizations to enhance the distribution of our products the segment was impacted by start up costs and under absorption of our new lvt sheet vinyl laminate and carpet tile operations our strategic acquisitions of the flooring

r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you chris and thank you frank as well for the introduction and support over these past weeks i am pleased and excited to be a part of the mohawk team and look very much forward to engaging with you our current and prospective shareholders and the broader investment community to build on an already strong relationship now to the financial performance and the year over year bridges first quarter net sales were 2 4 billion up 1 3 as reported compared to prior year or up 6 adjusted for days on a constant fx basis organic growth in legacy businesses measured in net sales per day on a constant fx basis was positive despite slowing markets and weather in north america up nearly 1 versus prior years one point of clarification for those of you who have picked this up who may not have picked this up already in our last earnings call it was stated that there would be one more day in the first quarter this year versus last year while in actuality there was one less day correspondingly there will be one more day in the fourth quarter this year i hope that clears up any questions back to the financials at the segment level legacy flooring rest of world showed the strongest growth largely offsetting continued weakness in flooring north america gross margin adjusted for special items came in at 27 1 in the first quarter a decrease of 280 basis points versus prior year the decrease was driven primarily due to inflation and inputs of 45 million weaker price mix of 12 million and market related downtime of 7 million partially offset by higher volume including acquisitions of 21 million and lower start up costs of 9 million fx impact on gross margin dollars was 22 million unfavorable in terms of overhead sg a per net sales was 18 7 excluding unusual items up 90 basis points due to investment in samples displays and marketing to drive sales special items in total were 41 million for the quarter of which 15 million was cash of the total 6 million was acquisition related and the remaining 35 million was restructuring made up of charges for replacing high cost assets and consolidating manufacturing and warehousing facilities in flooring north america as well as workforce reductions in global ceramic adjusted operating margin was 8 5 down from 12 1 last year as inflation and input cost headwinds of 51 million weaker price mix of 12 million and lower productivity of 4 million hit the bottom line increased market related downtime and softer volumes of 9 million were offset by reduced start up costs additionally fx translation of 11 million further reduced income and more than offset the transactional fx positive 4 million below the line in other income expense adjusted ebitda was 348 million or 14 3 before interest expense of 10 million up 8 million last year from last year the 2 million increase due to additional debt from acquisitions and share buybacks the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23 and is expected to move into the range of 20 to 22 in the second quarter while still maintaining guidance of 22 to 23 for the full year finally adjusted net earnings per share was 2 13 in the quarter down from 3 01 or 29 versus last year now let me turn to the segments global ceramics had a solid quarter the sales of with sales of 898 million an increase of 2 5 as reported versus last year with legacy sales per day holding at 1 on a constant fx basis adjusted operating income was 90 million or 10 of net sales down from 13 3 margin last year inflation and input cost headwinds were 21 million softer volume and market related downtime amounted to 7 million and additional costs for product development sales personnel and marketing were 5 million improving productivity of 8 million and lower start up costs of 2 million were partial offsets and fx translation was unfavorable by 3 million in the global ceramic segment in the flooring north america segment sales of 922 million decreased year over year by 3 on an as reported basis or 1 4 on a daily rate adjusted operating income dropped to 31 million or 3 4 of net sales in the quarter as input costs of 35 million and other inflation of 4 million combined with weaker volume of 15 million and lower productivity of 13 million were only modestly offset by 3 million in price mix with that said raw material costs peaked in the quarter with improvement expected in the second quarter as lower cost inventory works its way through the process and we also expect seasonally stronger sales now moving to flooring rest of the world the segment performed very well as sales improved year over year by 6 as reported with legacy sales per day up 4 on a constant fx basis acquisitions added 12 to the top line or 69 million adjusted operating income came in at 95 million or 15 3 of sales up 11 including acquisitions and on a constant fx basis as relief on overall inflation of 10 million driven by lower input costs and improved volume totaling 14 million driven by acquisitions and strong performance in lvt laminate and insulation in europe were only partially offset by lower price mix of 16 million fx translation was unfavorable by 8 million corporate expenses and eliminations drove an operating loss of 10 million with the full year estimate in the range of 35 million to 40 million speaking now to the balance sheet receivables ended the quarter at 1 7 billion with day sales outstanding improving versus the fourth quarter to 56 days roughly in line with last year inventories ended the quarter at 2 3 billion or 126 days slightly better than prior quarter and higher year over year by 293 million due to the ramp up of new plants acquisitions and higher raw material costs as shared in the segment detail inventories were adjusted in the first quarter with plant downtime going forward we will match our production with demand while continuing to try to optimize the supply chain fixed assets for the quarter held at 4 7 billion compared to the prior quarter on capital expenditures of 137 million in the period for 100 of depreciation in line with plan guidance for the full year continues to be capex spending within a range of 550 million to 580 million again roughly in line with depreciation of around 570 million so wrapping up total debt was 3 3 billion at the end of the quarter with leverage at 1 9 times debt to ebitda the balance sheet is strong and free cash flow of 33 million in the quarter improved materially over the same period last year by 100 million underlining expectations of a very solid year in terms of cash generation with that jeff i ll turn it back over to you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer thank you glenn all of

jeff as you look at the demand both in europe and in the us us is rising europe is starting to slow down could you talk some about the magnitude of each is the us acceleration offsetting europe or not and do you think europe the way you all are forecasting now do you expect europe sales to remain positive for the year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in us the industry we re anticipating with housing and what s going on in the market to be slower this year than last year but we really don t have good visuals into how that s going to evolve depending on the different estimates some people have been picking up dramatically as we go through the year and others have it still hesitating our estimates aren t any better in europe the economies are all slowing across europe and the competition is increasing as that occurs and in that environment we outperformed it in the first quarter we think we can continue to outperform it for the rest of the year stephen east wells fargo securities analyst got you okay and then as you look at flooring north america the big issue is obviously on the margin side versus the revenues but margin down about two thirds versus last year and it actually even though your op income was sequentially declined more than your revenues decline so i guess if you all can rank order the causes of the drop in your op income and any color on how you expect those to continue through the year jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer industry sales were weaker the production was lowered in order to reduce the inventories we had high material costs flowing through from prior which impacted the margins the price increases we put in are helping to offset except the mix is going the other direction we ve seen lower material costs and higher prices improving margins going into the second quarter to improve the costs we talked about replacing high cost assets closing inefficient operations we are consolidating multiple warehouses and we are reducing headcounts and overhead to improve the results stephen east wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs with baird your line is open timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst yeah hey hey good morning everybody i guess just maybe my first question on lvt is there any way to provide any sort of kind of numerical update maybe on just how the lvt performance is in north america maybe relative to last quarter or six months ago and how does that compare if you look at europe maybe as a proxy since that capacity has been up little longer than north america jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer what we ve said is that the global capacity when it s operating where we expect will be over a 1 billion when the plants are optimized as we go through in europe the lvt line is ahead of the us line and the process has stabilized the productivity and waste are continuing to get better we have identified equipment modifications which are being executed as the volumes going up to eliminate bottlenecks which are holding it up we are introducing products across our brand and rigid products to use the capacity and we re expanding our customer base in europe in the us we are making engineering modifications similar to ones that have already been put in europe the us is making progress in it we are shipping rigid products in the marketplace as we go through and i don t have any specific numbers to give you but we re confident that lvt will provide us advantages and through the year we ll continue increasing as we increase the volume the overhead absorptions and the returns will get better timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst okay is there of that 1 billion of capacity i mean is there any way to think about what the utilization is today on a run rate basis jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t have it to give you timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst okay and then i guess on the production side of things how are you kind of thinking about production as you kind of move into q2 and i guess if you look at the market for 2019 what market growth level are you assuming in your production expectations is it flat is it up slightly i m just trying to think about how you guys are thinking about top line growth in 19 organically jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s really different by market by market then you have the acquisitions going through i think timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst maybe just the us maybe just the us jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer in the us the numbers are not out for last year yet but we re estimating that the industry grew 3 to 3 5 and our assumptions are that with what s going on it ll be slower than that it ll be less than that even with the price inflation that s occurred overall is how we are sort of thinking about it the carpet industry sales in the first quarter were down and so were ours with lvt impacting them as we go through and it s also being impacted by mixed economy as we go through so i don t know if that would help you a little timothy wojs robert w baird company analyst okay no no that s helpful so maybe kind of on a volume basis a flattish sales growth for the market isn t a bad assumption w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of susan maklari with credit suisse your line is open susan maklari credit suisse analyst thank you good morning everybody my first question is how should we think about productivity in the us and especially given the initiatives that you have within carpet consolidating some of those assets lvt obviously coming online laminate all these different kind of projects that are coming through how should we think about those coming together and perhaps improving the productivity over time jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer so productivity across the business was impacted by lower manufacturing levels higher costs for the employees and the ramping up of these new projects all end up in productivity to improve the costs we talked about replacing assets and restructuring different parts and operations and we ve reduced both direct labor and overheads we think the productivity will continue to lag in the near term due to the inefficiencies in higher costs but we expect to see improvements continuing throughout the year susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay and then as we do think about the inventories and going into maybe a seasonally stronger period do you think that you ve fully rightsized the business how are you thinking about your level of utilization going into the second and the third quarters jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the inventory levels were up in the period but almost all the inventory increase was up due to new plants that require inventories to support them the acquisitions that we did last year the inventory flowing in and then with the tariffs that were expected the products we re importing from china would dramatically increase the inventories in the period for the most part most of our inventories in the ongoing businesses were kept under control with lower production rates and we re going to match the demand the production with the demand for the most part going forward susan maklari credit suisse analyst okay thank you w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of stephen kim with evercore isi your line is open stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah thanks very much guys i appreciate the time my first question relates to the role that mix played in the quarter and what we could expect into heading into 2q in the rest of the year in particular we noticed that the price mix number was pretty big negative in flooring rest of world and i know you also include mix by product type in your volume numbers and so i wanted to and i noticed that in flooring north america that volume no impact was a little higher than we expected so i guess my question is essentially can you help us understand what the mix dynamics product mix and channel mix were the main drivers in flooring north america and flooring rest of world and should we expect that those trends to be longer lasting throughout the rest of this year w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer for the mix the mix in flooring north america steve is the same thing that s been going on for some time first let me just say what we disclosed and talked about is a combination of price mix we have a difficult time pulling apart and separating them the mix in north america has been negative as we have seen a couple things one product changes where we ve seen product changing from higher price point nylon to lower price point polyester and then as we started putting in price increases that also drove some negative mix as well and then i think you re referring to the on the flooring rest of world the number you re speaking to is price mix combined right not mix itself correct stephen kim evercore isi analyst correct w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer yeah so i think what s happening in flooring rest of world is in some of the categories over there product categories we re seeing raw materials go down and that s impacting pricing jeff i don t know if you want to add anything to that or not jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer last year in the insulation business there was a shortage of raw materials and the prices spiked about 30 or more and the prices have in the recent time come back down so a major part of that is those prices coming down but at the same time it drove our selling prices up impacted the volume of the industry and us and with the prices the price the costs coming down we re lowering the selling prices along with the decreases but the volume of the product category is going up and it s doing reasonably well right now stephen kim evercore isi analyst got it okay that s helpful my second question relates to some of the management changes that we ve seen recently obviously glenn it s nice to have you aboard and frank we re going to be sorry when you re not as present on the calls but we ve also had some other questions regarding sort of deeper within the organization and so my question relates to number one in what is your plan in the global ceramic business and particularly daltile in terms of running that business or are you going to have any differences in how you manage that business and then secondly in flooring north america i wasn t sure if you had yet ahead of the resilient business in within flooring north america i know you broke that into five categories or paul did and so i just wanted to get a sense for how we re doing in terms of staffing on that jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we have a really strong organization and the north american ceramic business is operating well and continues to operate well at the moment we ve chosen for chris to operate as the interim president and we haven t selected another person at this point there s no rush the chris if you remember operated the business for many years and the organization is continuing to go forward we have selected someone else to run the other business and everything s like we would like it w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer stephen i would just comment that the throughout the ceramic segment now the organization is extremely strong europe russia brazil north america and of course j d and i sat beside each other for 20 years i put him in that job and i just want him time to get in the business again and it s working really well jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i just wanted chris to work another day a week stephen kim evercore isi analyst excellent okay thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets your line is open mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions my first question a lot of companies across building products have called out a number of headwinds in the quarter but one in particular has been destocking at large retail could you comment about kind of what the inventory levels are in your or your sense of where the inventory levels are from your larger customers and have you seen any changes in order patterns as part of that comment you made about improvement jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer well i can just comment on that in some cases in the ceramic side with large customers we have a lot of new products coming in and they are at the same time taking all the old products out so that s causing some of the destocking that you re talking about or it s just product changes w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer and some of the other ones there were some pushing out of it as it went through also mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it okay my second question jeff it s a bit bigger picture if i step back and think about the moving pieces and what you re talking about in some of your global operations clearly a big focus for you and the company has been expanding internationally over the past decade and increasingly the growth has come in countries that are emerging in nature and it seems like you re adding volatility to the portfolio alongside this global push and i wanted to just ask you how you re thinking about your global strategy at this point based on kind of how the past 12 months or so have informed your results jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i don t think it s changed anything nothing s come as a surprise you have periods of time where the us dollar strengthens and then the translated results are impacted as part of it the european businesses we re investing in we re trying to grow into other product categories as we ve talked about to expand our footprint in europe we have a strong organization and we think we are outperforming the market in russia we expanded our presence we have the leading ceramic business in russia where we expanded the laminate business and so russia is doing well we ve put in new equipment to expand it and we re putting more investments in as we grow our market share in russia we ve entered the brazilian market with the new acquisitions we made last fall we hired one of the best we bought one of the best businesses and got the talented management alongside it to operate it there will be more volatility in that marketplace but i think we re well positioned to do well within it and so as a general rule i would throw in australia too australia we knew that the marketplace was due for a slowdown and we bought it that was based on what we paid for it we think we paid the right amount for it given that we knew we were headed into it and no surprise that housing was overbuilt and softening right now the results are still good and they re changing the strategies as we go forward so i think we re doing the right things for the long term of the business w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer and mike i would just add one more thing just to make a point russia we ve been in since 2013 with the ceramic acquisition and we ve got a really good strong management team there and they have done a phenomenal job managing through the ups and downs and staying ahead of the market through both increasing and declining environments so overall i think we ve done a pretty good job of managing the complexity of the geographic footprint around the globe jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer but there is more volatility i mean the one we just talked about the translated results from russia 1 5 went in half with the ruble is it collapsed but our business is still strong there and still growing w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer and i would just add one more thing even when we go into a market like brazil we ve known eliane for 20 years we know the management team very well the president very well and so we ve done a lot of work before we make an acquisition like that mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay appreciate the thoughts thank you operator your next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust your line is open keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you there was a comment earlier in the call about reducing capacity specifically in flooring north america can you talk about what specifically you re doing and what s the timeline to get that completed w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer so the first thing is we installed some new low cost extrusion capacity which still is leading to closing in two old extrusion operations we re also closing a yarn plant a small tuck in plant in laminate we built a new warehouse to take off and we re closing two other warehouses and consolidated another plant with that move all of the things have good paybacks based on reducing the costs keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst so jeff are you taking are you lowering your overall extrusion capacity by these moves or are you just planning on that and the carpet volumes are just exceptionally weak in the last six months jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer we took out some high cost extrusion and it will be slightly less but not it won t keep it from meeting the ongoing demand keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst are you running extrusion below where you need to run it to make good profits w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer well we consolidate this together so the new assets we have half of it in and running now and the other half going in the next month i think and when we get through the costs our extrusion costs will come down if that s the question keith hughes suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of justin speer with zelman associates your line is open justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you guys this first question frank or glenn can you walk through or give us your free cash flow expectations for the year and within that your expectations for working capital drag as you map toward a full year number glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is glenn speaking like i said earlier free cash flow was strong in the quarter at 33 million it s 100 million better year over year and our outlook is very good and that s based on the fact that capital spending as we spoke to in our outlook will be down materially year over year and that is all upside versus last year so again we re quite confident in a very strong cash performance and cash generation and ultimately we believe we can whittle down that working capital during the year on efficiencies justin speer zelman associates analyst but i think the number was like 600 million or 700 million that you related last quarter is that still intact glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s north of that justin speer zelman associates analyst in terms of that working capital just looking at that the working capital as a percentage of sales is quite elevated at 25 so i think the highest we ve seen in quite a while and you mentioned a few of the puts and takes there most of the takes but how should we think about that as the year progresses and is there any risk of obsolescence within that number glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well the big driver on that is inventories justin and we ve been working as jeff mentioned to get our inventories down for some time i think that made good we ve made good progress with that the inventories are if you look at it from the end of last quarter to the end of this quarter about 50 million however days actually improved by one and a half days if you compare inventories to a year ago they re up over just a little bit over 290 million and most of that related to the new plants all the investments we re doing that we re putting out probably to get the inventories up before ahead of the sales the acquisitions that we ve done and then the higher chinese inventories that we came in came in to get ahead of the tariffs so i think justin speer zelman associates analyst so i think the last question sorry glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer i m just going to say i d just say i think we re managing our inventories well we re making progress and we ll be in line with where we need to be by the end of the year justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you and then next question is just the implied guidance and the sequencing of guidance i know it s an improvement in terms of year over year degradation but the second quarter guidance is below what most were expecting particularly giving the lower inputs that we saw with oil collapsing into january i know it s since reaccelerated but oil inputs down quite a bit pricing still good why is that the margin profile better next quarter and when should we see the year over year become more neutralized in your mind as we think as we started thinking about potentially a better back half in terms of underlying demand jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer as you said the results for the first quarter were at the high end of our expectations we expect the second quarter results to improve with higher pricing and volume and lower raw material costs at the same time as we look out we see the economy slowing and we see housing growth under pressure we also are having difficulty anticipating what the inflation is going to be for the rest of the year what we ve continued to say is that the year over year decline in margins will improve throughout the year and keep getting better and the future periods will have higher production rates will have increased pricing there will be less start up costs in them and we will start getting some of the benefits from the restructurings that we ve been talking about justin speer zelman associates analyst and can you quantify any of the restructuring benefit this year that falls into this year that you ve just announced in the press release w christopher wellborn president and chief operating officer we ll get some the activities will be ongoing through this year and then we ll see a much better benefit larger benefit full year benefit as we move into next year justin speer zelman associates analyst thank you appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of john baugh with stifel your line is open john baugh stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you for taking my questions and my condolences on john swift s passing sad news my question is two different ones one did you have a material increase in the amount of imported lvt to sell either year over year or sequentially and then is there any update on the accretion from the acquisitions you ve done any update with macro slowing particularly in australia to that guidance thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the important lvt sales are going up significantly we also brought in more inventory based on thinking there could be a 25 tariff increase ahead of it also the sales of our own manufacturing products are also going up as we go through you have the guidance we ve given glenn r landau executive vice president and chief financial officer well the accretion guidance hasn t really changed john i think we said for eliane the brazilian acquisition we expected annual eps accretion in the first year of about 0 15 and then on godfrey hirst i think we had said accretion of 0 15 in the second half of last year so about 0 30 for the full year so those numbers haven t changed john baugh stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you good luck operator your next caller or your next question comes from the line of phil ng with jefferies your line is open philip ng jefferies analyst hey guys i think part of the path toward earnings improvement going forward at some point productivity would flip positive you start lapping some of these price cost headwinds and you re done drawing down inventory just curious it d be helpful for you to kind of give us a sense if any of these pieces you re expecting to flip positively in the next few quarters or just any color on some of the time frame would be really helpful jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i think that we do expect those but at the same time we are having difficulty estimating the economies in the housing pieces we go through as well as the inflation right now and the only guidance we ve given is what we keep saying that the year over year decline in margins will improve and get better as we go through the year philip ng jefferies analyst okay and just on the product just in terms of production and inventory it sounds like it s a work in progress should we expect that to be a big headwind going forward just because it s been a drawdown dynamic throughout last few quarters do you have any better line of sight on that trend jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer most of it s behind us but there s still some of it left because the first quarter wasn t quite as strong as we thought but for the most part as we said we will be manufacturing most of the businesses similar to the demand philip ng jefferies analyst got it and then from a capacity standpoint just curious if you could give a little color in terms of where your capacity utilization is shaking out with some of the initiatives you ve done in north america going forward whether it s carpet is there an opportunity for you to kind of repurpose maybe some of your vinyl capacity into lvt thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer the different assets manufacture different products and so you can t relatively you can t easily switch them between one product category in another next question operator operator your next question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet your line is open michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi thanks for taking my question i just want to ask the margin question in other way i understand the pressures to 2q year over year since you re still destocking and there s a lot of price mix pressures but in third quarter you begin to lap some pretty major headwinds that were supposed to be temporary i m curious by third quarter what are the major pressure points to margins if you can is there going to be lower productivity or higher mix negative mix or cost pressures jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer i mean the problem we re having is you re asking for specific ongoing guidance which we continue to say we are giving the general piece of where it is we think that we have a lot of actions in place to improve our position in the business there s some questions about what will happen in the different environments such as depends on who you listen to the dollar strength could go up significantly depending on somebody or could go the other way dramatically depending on who you listen to the oil price hit recent highs lately it could be at 55 or it could be at 80 then which impacts the prices there s a lot of variables which we don t know how to put into the specifics and we don t want to lead you astray michael wood nomura instinet analyst understood okay and you talked about price being implemented across some product categories do you know yet whether or not they ve been successful taken by the market and any quantification in terms of what that incremental benefit could be jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer there are price increases and most products and most geographies that have been implemented and the prices are flowing into the business which is helping the second quarter also there is increases in various places you mentioned brazil the gas prices have gone up astronomically we have the same thing in mexico as yet so the pricing is covering in some cases it s covering the changing pieces in other cases it should help the margin which is why the second quarter is going to be better michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you operator the final question is from the line of matthew bouley with barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst hi thanks for taking my question on the inflation side jeff understanding it s not your business to predict commodities but how does that oil price rebound kind of impact your thoughts around price increases specifically in carpet do you think that further price increases would be necessary just kind of looking at where commodities are at this point thank you jeffrey s lorberbaum chairman and chief executive officer it s too early to tell the price is highly volatile it could drop significantly or stay the same or go up in general it takes anywhere from two months to three months four months to pass through to our purchases and that also changes depending on supply and demand dynamics of the various steps in between so we re watching it and we ll have to see the move has been recent and we have no idea whether it s going to it s going to be maintained or if it s going to go up or down from here quickly so our guesses are no better than anybody else in the oil business and the chemical businesses as you go through with that i d like to make sure everybody understands that we re taking the actions to improve our results we re confident that our new investments will give us the returns we want in time as we wrap them up we re taking actions to improve the existing businesses and we appreciate you joining us for the call thank you very much operator ladies and

indiaâ s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending mar 31 to usd 140 5 bn against usd 108 bn the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy new delhi surging global oil prices will pose a first big challenge to indiaâ s new government whoever wins an election now under way especially as domestic prices have been allowed to lag meaning consumers are in for a painful surge as they catch up for oil import dependent india higher global prices could lead to a weaker rupee higher inflation the ruling out of interest rate cuts and could further weigh on twin current account and budget deficits economists warned but compounding the future pain state run fuel suppliers and retailers have held off passing on to consumers the higher prices during a staggered general election which began on april 11 and ends on may 23 according to sources familiar with the situation that delay is expected to be unwound once the election is over and there could be additional price increases to make up for losses or profits missed during the period of delayed increases the sources said in some major asian countries such as japan and south korea pump prices are adjusted periodically so they move largely in tandem with international crude prices that was what was supposed to happen in india but the election means there have been many days when pump prices have been unchanged in new delhi for example while crude oil prices have gone up by nearly usd 9 a barrel or about 12 per cent in the past six weeks gasoline prices have only risen by 0 47 rupees a litre or 0 6 per cent state controlled fuel suppliers and retailers declined to say why they had delayed price increases or discuss whether there has been any pressure from the government of prime minister narendra modi a government spokesman declined to comment the opposition congress party said modiâ s government was violating its own policy of daily price revision by advising the state oil companies to hold prices steady â the government should cut fuel taxes otherwise consumers will have to pay much higher oil prices once the elections are over â said akhilesh pratap singh a senior leader of the congress party nitin goyal treasurer at the all india petroleum dealers association representing fuel stations in 25 states said prices were similarly held down for 19 days in the southern state of karnataka last year when it held state assembly elections only for them to surge after the vote â consumers should be ready for a rude shock of a massive jump in retail prices similar to the level we have seen in the karnataka state election â goyal said â credit negativeâ sri paravaikkarasu director for asia oil at singapore based consultancy fge said retail prices of gasoline and gasoil prices would have been up to 6 per cent or about 4 rupee higher if they had been allowed to rise in line with global prices â indian pump prices have failed to keep up with the recent uptrend in crude prices â paravaikkarasu said â with the countryâ s general elections underway the incumbent government has been keeping pump prices relatively unchanged â india had switched to a daily price revision in june 2017 from a revision every two weeks as the government allowed retailers to set prices but the government faced protests last october when retailers raised prices by up to 10 rupees a litre after the crude oil price went above usd 80 a barrel forcing it to cut fuel taxes global prices rose to their highest level in 2019 on thursday days after the united states announced all iran sanction waivers would end by may pressuring importers including india to stop buying tehranâ s oil higher oil prices will mean asiaâ s third largest economy is likely to see growth of less than 7 per cent rate this fiscal year economists said growth slowed to 6 6 per cent in the october december quarter the slowest in five quarters rating agency care has warned that a 10 percent rise in global oil prices could increase demand for dollars putting pressure on the rupee and widening the current account deficit indiaâ s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending march 31 to usd 140 5 billion against usd 108 billion the previous year â the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy â icra the indian arm of the fitch rating agency said in a note â every usd 10 per bbl increase in crude oil prices increases the fiscal deficit by about 0 1 per cent of gdp â any big price rise would also build a case for the central bank to keep rates steady or even raise them the reserve bank of indiaâ s monetary policy committee which cut the benchmark policy repo rate by 25 basis points this month warned that

i m mike gleason and welcome to this week s market wrap podcast a few weeks ago we heard the first half of an interview money metals president stefan gleason did during a recent 360 gold summit today we ll hear part two of that interview stefan gives some important warnings to precious metals investors discusses why he favors one of the precious metals over the others and also talks about some really important things to consider when selecting a precious metals dealer don t miss the eye opening conclusion of stefan s interview coming up after this week s market update well the big headline in markets this week the s p 500 pushed to a new all time high in nominal terms but is it a new high in real terms most in the financial media don t want to ask that question they would rather join their wall street sponsors in celebrating a new official record president donald trump certainly didn t miss the opportunity to boast about the stock market s strength under his watch cnbc reporter you heard the president starting off there with the stock market obviously he sees that as a piece of good news and an overall barometer for the economy under his leadership i asked the president how high he thinks the stock market can go he didn t respond to that one donald trump the stock market and our country from an economic standpoint is doing the best probably it s ever done we re hitting new highs again we ve hit new highs i guess close to or over 100 times since i m president from the time of the election the trump tax cuts for corporations and his administration s relative business friendly approach to regulation have certainly given equity markets a boost but stocks have also benefited from a general rising sea of liquidity thanks to the federal reserve investors shouldn t be fooled by records that get set because of artificial stimulus from central bankers there has never been a clearer case of the federal reserve goosing the stock market than the current rally that began off last year s pre christmas lows under pressure from wall street and the white house plunge protection team to back off on rate hikes fed chairman jerome powell announced a pause earlier this spring he confirmed the pause would continue for the remainder of the year for wall street it has been perhaps the greatest pause of all time judging by the nominal gains registered over the past four months despite the celebratory mood surrounding stocks there is a striking number of what market technicians call non confirmations the transportation index hasn t hit a new high the small cap russell 2000 index is nowhere near a new high and the s p 500 itself is far short of a new high when measured against raw materials including crude oil and gold yes despite the gold market s frustratingly sluggish performance over the past few years the monetary metal has still outperformed the stock market over a longer term frame it may be hard to believe given all the current hoopla around stocks but since 2000 gold bullion has still doubled the gains of the s p 500 stocks are up big in terms of dollars in terms of hard money though it s been a lost generation for equities investors won t necessarily hear that inconvenient truth told to them by the talking heads on cnbc turning to this week s market action in precious metals gold is managing a 0 9 gain to trade at 1 289 an ounce with most of that gain coming here thanks to a bit of a friday rally silver which dropped below 15 in trading earlier this week is now a tick above it and is essentially unchanged on the week now to bring spot prices to 15 10 the platinum market shows a weekly decline of 0 8 to trade at an even 900 and finally palladium looks higher by 1 4 this week as prices check in at 1 462 per ounce and like gold with all of that gain coming here on friday metals markets faced headwinds this week from both a rising stock market and rising u s dollar index the dollar rose toward a 2 year high against its major foreign currency counterparts even as the federal reserve has turned dovish central banks around the developed world from japan to sweden to canada have turned even more dovish they are aggressively committing to ultra low interest rates in some cases even negative interest rates in the face of weak economies if this dynamic continues to push the dollar higher against foreign currencies the fed will come under increasing pressure to cut rates futures markets are currently pricing in a quarter point rate cut by the end of the year fed policymakers haven t yet signaled they will make such a move but there are signs the economy is slowing significantly enough to give them justification despite the record high stock market and historically low official unemployment rate gdp is slumping and housing is hitting the skids perhaps investor optimism toward stocks will finally begin to wane the big question is whether the next round of fed stimulus benefits primarily the stock market again or whether monetary inflation gets reflected more in other asset classes such as commodities and precious metals that question could start getting answered later this year well now without further delay let s get to this week s featured interview of money metals president stefan gleason as we listen to the conclusion of his remarks during the 360 gold summit a discussion about all things precious metals and we start off where stefan answers the important question about how to select a precious metals dealer stefan gleason you want be careful about who you are doing business with you want to do a little research probably start small with that dealer and see how it goes see how the service is see how the delivery is another place to acquire precious metals would be from a local dealer money metals exchange is a national dealer there is other several other good national dealers local dealers are a little bit more sort of unknown some are very good some are not one of the problems though buying locally is that you are often faced with sales taxes many states i think it is about 20 states actually force dealers who sell inside of their states to collect sales taxes which are significant especially when you consider that an ounce of gold might cost 5 6 7 over spot well if you add a 7 sale sales tax to that that s a huge huge markup in the context of the numbers you normally see in precious metals so that is a disadvantage that many local dealers have when compared to a national dealer but the advantage perhaps especially if you are very nervous about dealing with somebody from a long distance is that presumably you can walk out that day with your metals after having paid instead of having to wait a couple days in the mail for it to arrive on the other hand they may not be as well equipped locally to detect fakes which are not a big problem but they are out there and there may less of an education component involved but look at your options obviously our customers are buying from us many of them bought locally and then changed to us pete fetig that is a really interesting observation with the sales tax when you think about it you are actually exchanging one form of currency for real money you are not buying anything you are not selling you are exchanging stefan gleason right that is an extremely concerning subject as you pointed out you are changing one form of money paper u s dollars or coins for another form of money that is recognized by our constitution as money article 1 section 10 of the constitution sets up gold and silver as the only money that is supposed to be accepted in the states we have also obviously got away from that the idea that you would have to pay sales taxes as though it some sort of good as opposed to money could imagine if you went to the bank and had to pay sales tax to break a 10 bill into a roll of quarters i mean that is basically the equivalent gold and silver is disfavored by the sales tax laws in many states and then at the federal level you have to pay capital gains taxes when your gold and silver goes up in dollar terms but it may not have really gone up in the context of purchasing power what happened was the dollar went down so it s kind of an example of the inflation tax you are being taxed essentially through the capital gains tax on the inflation that the government is creating and so these are the public policies that we are working to spotlight and hopefully change over time that is to repeal the sales tax laws that are discriminatory against people for exchanging one form of money for a better more trusted form of money and then of course the discriminatory capital gains tax and unfortunately it is even at a higher rate than say a stock a long term capital gain on gold bullion is taxed at 28 and not 15 like you would with a gain in a stock so there are definitely some problems we can get into this in a minute that is one of the advantages of holding precious metals in your ira is that you can buy and sell without having to pay those gains every time pete fetig is there anything more important than choosing the right product and getting it for a low price stefan gleason the most important thing is getting delivery and that means getting your metal i would say that in some cases the lowest price can be a red flag if somebody is selling gold and silver for below its actual value there is probably something wrong we recently ran across somebody who had bought some gold from a bitcoin exchange and he bought it at a discount a discount to its market price well that is kind of a red flag gold and silver is not at a discount to the spot price particularly on the buy side so the lowest price is not necessarily the best safest place to go obviously there is some very good low cost dealers including money metals exchange but there s also been horror stories of low cost dealers i will mention one that went out of business tulving company they were super low no service almost kind of mean to their customers if you dealt with them eventually at one point about 2 years ago 100s of people stopped getting delivery something like 20 million worth of gold and silver was never delivered so getting a low price is no good at all if you are not actually getting your metal the most important thing is working with somebody and getting what you paid for pete fetig very true how does the average person trust a dealer or an organization that supplies the coin or bullion stefan gleason well the first thing is doing a little research you should always do that with any purchase you should know who you re dealing with when it comes to precious metal dealers the first thing i think look them up on the bbb see if there are complaints see how they have handled those complaints everybody probably can have a complaint but how they dealt with those how many they have what kind of rating they have that is one way of doing the research there is another site called bullion directory which has reviewed 100s of companies across the globe we were honored to have been named precious metals dealer of the year in the united states last year by that ratings group international ratings group those are two things you can do research the bbb and bullion directory the other thing is size them up look at their website look at the content that they have if they have an email list get on your email list and start small if you are worried about it you re not 100 sure buy a small amount and see how it goes see how good the communication is see if they provide you with transparent pricing and fast delivery do they confirm that they got your payment was their invoice exactly what you expected was it packaged well was there pride put into the way they handled everything with their customer if you have a good experience that is a really good sign obviously it is not a guarantee but you really need to pay attention to the people you are doing business with and that s just as much if not more the case when it comes to precious metals we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us pete fetig what sort of considerations are important to make before and after acquiring stefan gleason i would say that there are a couple things that i would emphasize one is what are you going to do with it when you get it where are you going to put it how are you going to store it most of our customers probably keep it somewhere in their house a few will put it in their bank safe deposit box some will stored in a depository or at a brink s facility some will put it in their home safe but some will hide it in other unpredictable places so if you have a lot of precious metals you probably want to have some of it stored remotely because that is a lot to have in your house i do think that everybody should have the ability to get their hands on their gold and silver at least some of it very quickly if they need to so storage is one consideration some people are reluctant and i can understand why to store it in their bank safe deposit box in fact the banks are part of this war on cash and even war on precious metals some banks are saying you cannot hold gold and silver or cash in your bank safe deposit box you may be banking with one of those banks but there are also concerns from back in the 1930s fdr issued an executive order banning private gold ownership in america some people felt like the gold that they had in the safe deposit box was being disclosed and potentially seized that never actually happened but most people turned it involuntarily or many people did but there s less privacy perhaps if you hold it in the bank i think people rightly are little reluctant to do that the other thing is in addition to figure how you are going to store it and where you are going to put it is really to think about the responsibility that you have as a precious metals owner or as a person to keep your financial business to yourself a trusted person or a spouse certainly should be aware if something happens to you but you should not be talking about how you bought all this gold and silver bringing out your collection and showing it to everybody that comes and visits there s been unfortunately some really horrific situations where people have not kept her mouth shut had been talking way too much about what they own and found themselves with a home invasion or a robbery so that s the other thing figure out how you are going to store it and also discipline yourself to keep your financial business as private as possible pete fetig very good points how can the average person best understand appreciation of his holdings or the upside value stefan gleason the first reason to own gold and silver is not necessarily for these spectacular gains although i think you are going to see those at least in dollar terms the first reason is to own it as insurance and as a hedge but particularly with silver probably also with gold there is a huge potential upside even real terms right now we are seeing negative interest rates emerge in europe we are seeing 0 interest rates here in the u s one of the big knocks on gold and silver is it does not pay any interest well neither does the dollar now and then on top of that you have the devaluation of the principal when you own dollars so gold and silver are becoming very attractive assets that is particularly been evidenced in the last few months gold and silver have done extremely well so there s definitely some real potential upside to gold and silver in terms of when to get out i think that you probably want to be owning gold and silver forever a certain amount but if you re more of a speculator and you have larger amounts than you probably do want to be looking for opportunities to sell over time but i would say right now is a buying opportunity down the road you could see silver at 100 an ounce or even higher gold could be several thousand dollars an ounce before this is all over particularly if the devaluation continues and maybe you ll want to lighten your holdings right now i think you are wise to be in the accumulation mode unless you need the money because you need to liquidate for other reasons pete fetig that makes sense i guess related would be when might an average person consider liquidating his holdings are there any solid event types that might precipitate liquidating all of what you have versus only some of what you have stefan gleason if you see the u s government live within its means and the debt goes from 18 trillion down to 0 that might be a good time to seriously lighten up on precious metals i personally don t see that happening i do not think most people do i think we are locked on a path here so i think there is always going to be a significant role for precious metals in your portfolio regardless but perhaps if you saw an outbreak of sanity in washington dc and around the world and peace emerging and all these geopolitical things simmering down and terrorism going away i think it might be time to seriously consider selling a fair amount of your gold and silver but we re not in that situation the way to approach this is to not try to pick a bottom or a top it would be accumulate over time in smaller amounts don t go all in and don t sell all at once i would look at this as a way of getting on a plan and slowly and steadily increasing the number of ounces you own and then if we get down the road and you do see things changing and 40 of the american people are talking about you re getting your shoes shined and the guy is talking about owning gold and silver maybe that is the time to start selling but we are nowhere near that situation and most people are dangerously exposed in not owning any so i would get on a monthly plan and accumulate now is the time to accumulate down the road would be a time to potentially disgorge some your holdings or if you have a need for it if you re in retirement or you have some big expenses obviously you do not want to lock up all of your available cash in precious metals just do what you can over time to accumulate and i think you will be rewarded for it pete fetig and somewhat related in terms of best place to get it what about best places to liquidate it is there a type of list that would be investors might consider comparing against or going to stefan gleason well usually and certainly it s the case with money metals exchange you can sell to the same people that you buy from we ll buy anybody s gold or silver coins bars and rounds we obviously check it and ensure that it is what it is we make sure we have it in our facility before we pay the customer once we verify it but we buy back and we would love to buy back unfortunately for us most of our customers are just buying from us and very few are selling to us so we actually have to buy from mints and wholesalers and the u s mint and so forth we d love to buy more of our inventory from our customers because obviously we are buying from a middleman we do make a market probably only about 5 to 10 of our inventory is sourced from our customers we are eager to buy and we offer probably the highest or among the highest buyback prices of any of our competitors we are as eager to buy from our customers as we are to sell to our customers and that s probably the case with most dealers we are not retailers we are dealers and that means that we both and sell you probably would go back to where you bought it but you do not have to we buy stuff from people that they bought elsewhere all the time and are happy to do so the items that we deal in are very standard recognizable liquid some people may want to sell to their local dealer and that s fine too they want to walk out with the cash they may not get as good a price but it depends on what your priorities are there is no problem selling your precious metals but that s a very good question because a lot of times people say how do i sell what do i do with it it is really about as easy to sell it as it is to buy it you contact a dealer or walk into a dealer shop they offer you a price you give them the metal and they pay you it s that simple it is about the same process in reverse as when you buy from us pete fetig i m going to switch gears just a little bit here how about other precious metals like platinum palladium etc are there times when an investor should be considering acquiring those precious metals or vice versa or liquidating if they are already held stefan gleason platinum and palladiums are the other two major precious metals there s rhodium for example which is even less considered an investment asset platinum and palladium are still a very small part of the precious metals market there s less of it i should mention but it is not as big of an investment asset it is more of an industrial asset platinum and palladium are used for catalytic converters diesel and gasoline catalytic converters with automotive demand for example platinum and palladium can go up and down based on what is happening in the automotive market it is also a financial asset there are etfs now of course there are physical bars and rounds and coins of all of these including platinum and palladium but i would definitely not get into those until you have already got a significant or at least a reasonable holding of gold and silver those are the two that you want to start with platinum and palladium is a little bit more for down the road in terms of the upside again a lot of it is driven by industrial demand but they are also undervalued versus gold as i discussed earlier silver is way undervalued versus gold historically both in recent history as well as the longer term history but platinum and palladium are undervalued platinum is way below the price of 1 ounce of gold and it s typically 1 5 to 2 times the price of gold over time platinum is way undervalued versus gold but again that is really not something to jump into until after you already have a meaningful holding of gold and silver pete fetig it also sounds like something that you probably would not do until you better understood the market and price swings and so forth of the precious metals in general what about owning precious metals in your ira how does that work should you own the only physical metal or shares of metal backed by etf stefan gleason etfs again if you want to trade and you want to do in your stock account it is convenient but there these precious metals backed etfs they re really a proxy you don t own direct title to the metal you own shares of a trust that supposedly owns the metal and then there is a whole series of custodians and sub custodians and sub sub custodians involved in that kind of instrument so if you re buying gold and silver as insurance then why introduce counterparty risk into something that is supposed to be your safe asset there are reasons people want to buy that certainly it is convenient but it s not necessarily cheaper than owning it and storing it and paying the storage fees yourself there s still fees involved in the etfs i don t think that s really something people should be doing they should be buying physical gold and silver that they have direct title to pete fetig what sort of things or education can the average person do for themselves to be better prepared to consider precious metals investing stefan gleason this is something our company money metals exchanges is really big on and that is education and content we want our customers to be well informed and we want to keep them updated there are lots of websites out there but a great place is to go to moneymetals com and get on our email list we send out 2 or 3 informative articles about the markets each week pay attention get a little gold and silver in your hand start thinking about it start thinking about what it means compare it to paper money it s interesting the first time i had gold and silver my hand 20 years ago it really got the wheels turning what is this fiat money what is this federal reserve note why does it have value why do people accept it and compare that to this beautiful timeless metal of gold and silver and it really gets the wheels turning and that opened up an education process for me and i think it does a lot of people and we think the best customers are the best informed and that s certainly what we strive for i want to get back to precious metals iras that s one thing that is an area where people might be best able to put money into precious metals because they have ira accounts there something called a self directed ira you can set up an account with a self directed ira company and then work with a dealer like us and with a depository you can directly hold title your ira can directly hold title to physical metal inside of your iras that s another way of getting into this market that we definitely encourage people to look at pete fetig a lot safer than to be speculating in the stock market that is for sure is there any method to the madness in how the average person might approach what he considers owner or holding when i say that for example is there any sort of 80 20 type of rule or rules of ratio for gold to silver holdings stefan gleason i would say that the more likely you are to need to access the gold and silver and turn it into cash or liquidate out of it the more likely that that s the case probably the higher percentage that you want to have in gold gold tends to be a little more consistent it s rising but it s less of a roller coaster silver can be quite volatile when priced in dollars and of course some of that is just the volatility of the dollar itself but i would say if you re looking at a 3 to 5 year horizon then definitely favor silver if you re only going to own gold and silver for a year or 2 and think you might need to liquidate out of it then perhaps you should favor gold and have a majority of your funds in gold but this isn t something that you should be buying and selling like stock this is something you should be accumulating and not necessarily looking to liquidate it any time soon it s there if you need it do not necessarily plan on buying gold and silver if you think you are going to need the money in 6 months there are some transaction costs involved not significant if you go to the right places but that is a something to keep in mind going back to you what i said earlier silver is definitely the more potentially explosive upside metal as long as you not looking very short term i would definitely have a majority of your funds in silver but make sure you get some gold pete fetig very good well we re running up against a time constraint here i wanted to thank you for joining us and offering all of your just excellent insights and observations and answers to all the questions that we have thrown at you today before we leave though i would like to offer you the opportunity to let people know how to reach you and to contact you at money metal exchange stefan gleason thank you so much for the opportunity and hopefully i ve shown education is a big part of what we do at money metals i think when compared to other dealers that s one of our very strongest differentiating factors go to moneymetals com look at the products most importantly get on our email list and let us continue to educate you about the market we also have a monthly savings plan which you can get into where you set up a certain amount each month where we debit your bank account or whatever your instructions are and send you on a steady schedule gold and silver and that s a great way to accumulate kind of put it on auto pilot so that s available at moneymetals com as well but i certainly really appreciated the opportunity to talk about this important subject and also about a company pete fetig well thank you for joining us today and folks thanks for listening in and we hope you guys have a great day
wolf richter wolfstreet com www amazon com author wolfrichter dollar hegemony is a tough nut to crack china is taking another baby step in promoting the internationalization of the renminbi and nibble on the hegemony of the us dollar it s pushing a proposal to add a pile of yuan to the 240 billion currency swap agreement between asean plus china japan and south korea in order reduce the system s reliance on the us dollar and to enhance its own economic clout in the region according to the nikkei on may 2 the finance ministers and central bankers of asean singapore brunei malaysia thailand philippines indonesia vietnam laos cambodia and myanmar along with those from china japan and korea will meet in fiji to discuss modifications to the swap agreement the chiang mai initiative china which co chairs the meeting with thailand has added language to the draft joint statement concerning use of asian currency contributions to the pool which for now is still entirely in dollars as one option to enhance the swap arrangement allowing participants to access asian currencies in an emergency could encourage their use in other contexts including foreign exchange reserves the thinking goes the nikkei said the idea also anticipates a long term rise in demand for these currencies in regional investment and trade china in particular sees it as another step on the path to internationalizing the yuan and expanding its economic influence in the region but the proposal is likely to be complicated by u s alarm at the prospect of beijing expanding its currency s role at the dollar s expense the chiang mai initiative was a response to the 1997 asian currency crisis it consists of a pool of us dollars contributed by members that members can draw on when their currencies come under attack since its establishment in 2000 the dollar pool has been increased to 240 billion china is now lobbying the other members to add yuan and yen to that pool this is just one more effort by china to internationalize its currency which has been a tough and thankless slog so far despite the size of the chinese economy and its giant weight in the global economic fabric in terms of global reserve currency the renminbi rmb has a share of only 1 9 in fifth place and barely ahead of the canadian dollar but miles behind the us dollar 61 7 and the euro 20 7 over the past two years the rmb has made only microscopic headway as a reserve currency and as an international payments currency the rmb has failed similarly to crack the co hegemony of the dollar and the euro with more than 1 900 financial institutions now using the rmb for payments with china and hong kong the internationalization of rmb carries great strategic significance for banks and financial institutions gushes swift society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication which tracks the progress of the rmb as payment currency but in march 2019 the rmb had a minuscule share of merely 1 22 for international cross border payments by value cross border payments from one eurozone country to another eurozone country are excluded this minuscule share put the rmb in 8th position just behind the swiss franc we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us two years ago in march 2017 the rmb s share had been 1 05 in other words in two years the share of the rmb had ticked up by a whopping 17 basis points from 1 05 to 1 22 at this pace about 8 5 basis points per year the rmb will reach a share of 3 by 2040 meanwhile the dollar s share increased to 45 58 from 45 44 two years ago and the euro s share increased to 32 80 from 32 28 two years ago so by this measure and for this time span the rmb made minuscule progress against smaller currencies but lost ground against the dollar and euro so chipping away at the dollar euro co hegemony as payments currencies will take some patience and lots of baby steps such as china s efforts to add yuan to the swap arrangement under the chiang mai initiative the troubled internationalization of the rmb was topic of a 2018 report by swift s chief executive of apac emea alain raes looking back on 2017 when the rmb internationalization had actually backtracked on one hand its internationalization was supported by major trends such as the growth of cashless payments mainly driven by the digital giants alipay and wechat pay the far reaching belt road initiative the globalization of chinese banks and their adoption of swift gpi the progress of china s cross border interbank payment system cips on the other hand there was this despite these trends there are a number of critical success factors necessary for widespread adoption of the rmb and that s where it gets tough the headwinds the rmb faces in the short term include capital controls imposed by the chinese government and ongoing concerns over the chinese currency s depreciation the report sees the belt and road initiative as china s key strategy to muscle in on the dollar as a payments and finance currency the belt and road initiative involves large infrastructure projects in asia europe particularly eastern europe the middle east latin america and africa there is opportunity for china to use the rmb as a currency for these projects and chinese companies could potentially move to transactions denominated in rmb swift s report said not unexpectedly banks are stepping up to take advantage of the shift china is also pushing countries along the bri to allow greater usage of the rmb though countries are not always responding favorably swift says thus listing another headwind for the rmb resistance from other countries china is known to be patient and can measure progress in decades rather than in quarters but the progress of the rmb s internationalization must be nerve wracking slow even for china

quarter of 2019 the government reported friday blowing past expectations and prompting celebration among president donald trump and his advisers better than expected growth ongoing strength in the job market and a new all time high in the stock market this week are tamping down fears of a recession and inviting comparisons of the current economy to the record 1990s boom trump has tied the success of his presidency to jobs and the performance of the stock market which can oscillate widely but is currently on the upswing with the standard poor s 500 stock index closing the week at a new high we re knocking it out of the park trump said friday before a speech at a national rifle association convention in indianapolis we have great growth and also very very low inflation our economy is doing great advertisement many economists had predicted anemic growth at the start of the year as the partial government shutdown market jitters and extremely cold weather caused many businesses and consumers to hit the pause button on big purchases but forecasters raised their estimates as it became clear some one time factors would temporarily lift the economy over half the growth in the first quarter was driven by an unusually low trade deficit and a surge in inventories with companies beefing up their supplies after depleting them last year it was impressive gdp until you dig into some of the numbers said lindsey piegza chief economist at stifel fixed income she pointed to a key gauge of consumer and business demand final sales to private domestic purchasers which was just 1 3 percent the weakest in more than three years economists are divided about how the economy is likely to perform the rest of this year and early next year a time when many americans are likely to form their opinions on how trump s economy is doing ahead of the 2020 election some experts including at the federal reserve forecast growth will slow to about 2 percent similar to the obama years while other see growth sticking closer to 2 5 percent which would be noticeably above trend but there is broad agreement that a recession looks increasingly unlikely ahead of the election in november next year in some ways today s economy feels like 1998 or 1999 with robust growth low unemployment and meager inflation that shows few signs of spiking confidence in the economy is high and the stock market much like in the late 1990s has been on a bullish ride led by technology stocks it looks like the goldilocks scenario of strong growth and benign inflation is still happening much like the 1990s said neil dutta head of economics at renaissance macro research more americans appear to be feeling the gains with 53 percent of consumers saying they have personally experienced an improvement in their finances in the past month according to the university of michigan survey of consumers released friday the highest average since 1999 gallup polling found similar results with half of americans giving the economy an excellent or good rating lately the most upbeat assessment since 2001 but there are two major differences between the current economy and that of the late 1990s that could worry policymakers inequality is higher now and the government is far more constricted in its ability to act if a downturn hits another recession will surely come at some point and we are going to enter that next recession in a difficult position said christina romer an economics professor at the university of california at berkeley and former head of president barack obama s council of economic advisers the federal government is on track to run a deficit of nearly 1 trillion this year because of government spending and trump s tax cuts setting up a highly unusual situation of piling on debt in good economic times the united states is the only major economy projected to increase its debt as a percentage of gdp over the next five years according to the international monetary fund which could make it more challenging to increase federal spending in a crisis the other typical response in times of trouble is for the federal reserve to cut interest rates but there is much less scope to do that nowthan there was 20 years ago in the late 1990s interest rates were sitting at about 5 percent today they are just shy of 2 5 percent and trump has been calling for further reductions blaming high interest rates for holding back growth if we kept the same interest rates and the same quantitative easing that the previous administration had that 3 2 would have been much higher than that trump said friday wage growth though higher over the past year is also below the levels of the late 1990s when wages were growing 4 percent a year because of massive technology investment that boosted productivity today s economy is not anywhere close to the late 1990s said joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting firm rsm we are not seeing the increases in productivity and wages that we saw in that period when everyone called alan greenspan the maestro while wages for many lower income americans are rising faster than the cost of living as companies boost wages to attract and retain workers inequality has been rising wealthy americans are benefiting far more from rising stocks and home prices than the working class many of whom do not own their homes or have much if any invested in the market how voters weigh these economic issues against other considerations at the ballot box remains to be seen trump has vowed he can get the u s economy growing at an annual pace of 3 percent or better for the next decade a scenario independent forecasts don t believe is achievable but the president s top economic advisers say they are revising their growth forecasts even higher after examining the data they believe growth would have been 3 5 percent in the first quarter without the shutdown and that consumption will pick up later this year right now we would be inclined to increase our forecasts not only was last year not a sugar high but it appears the economy is accelerating kevin hassett head of trump s council of economic advisers said in an interview first quarter growth is typically the weakest of the year but this year could unfold differently as the one time effects fade the first quarter number is overstating the strength of the economy said ben herzon executive director at macroeconomic advisers businesses were building inventories like crazy that is not going to last after a big buying spree in the winter companies are unlikely to keep expanding their inventory this spring meaning second quarter growth could take a hit the unusual jump in u s exports is also likely to be hard to sustain if the trade deficit widens in the second quarter that would also be a drag on growth a jump in state and local government spending also boosted first quarter growth by the biggest amount in three years u s consumers are likely to be the key factor in whether the economy has a normal subpar or extraordinary year because consumer spending drives about 70 percent of growth americans sharply pulled back spending at the end of last year but there are signs they started buying again in march which should create a spring bounce to keep the economy expanding at a decent pace for the past several years this trend has played out with weaker spending in the first quarter and stronger spending in the spring and summer hassett said the president s top economic priority now is closing trade deals with china and europe and getting congress to pass the u s mexico canada agreement the revised north american trade deal the international monetary fund recently predicted growth would pick up in the second half of the year for the world economy and likely the united states propelled by the expected resolution of the u s china trade war and the fed s decision to hold off on raising interest rates the economy is not slowing nearly as much as people think said dutta of renaissance macro research a 3 2 percent pace cannot be sustained but the federal reserve and markets have probably cut their growth estimates too far for this year

new delhi surging global oil prices will pose a first big challenge to india s new government whoever wins an election now under way especially as domestic prices have been allowed to lag meaning consumers are in for a painful surge as they catch up for the oil import dependent country higher global prices could lead to a weaker rupee higher inflation the ruling out of interest rate cuts and could further weigh on twin current account and budget deficits economists warned but compounding the future pain state run fuel suppliers and retailers have held off passing on to consumers the higher prices during a staggered general election which began april 11 and ends may 23 according to sources familiar with the situation that delay is expected to be unwound once the election is over and there could be additional price increases to make up for losses or profits missed during the period of delayed increases the sources said in some major asian countries such as japan and south korea pump prices are adjusted periodically so they move largely in tandem with international crude prices that was what was supposed to happen in india but the election means there have been many days when pump prices have been unchanged in new delhi for example while crude oil prices have gone up by nearly 9 a barrel or about 12 per cent in the past six weeks petrol prices have only risen by 47 paise a litre or 0 6 per cent state controlled fuel suppliers and retailers declined to say why they had delayed price increases or discuss whether there has been any pressure from the government of prime minister narendra modi a government spokesman declined to comment the opposition congress party said pm modi s government was violating its own policy of daily price revision by advising the state oil companies to hold prices steady the government should cut fuel taxes otherwise consumers will have to pay much higher oil prices once the elections are over said akhilesh pratap singh a senior leader of the congress party nitin goyal treasurer at the all india petroleum dealers association representing fuel stations in 25 states said prices were similarly held down for 19 days in karnataka last year when it held state assembly elections consumers should be ready for a rude shock of a massive jump in retail prices similar to the level we have seen in the karnataka state election mr goyal said credit negative sri paravaikkarasu director for asia oil at singapore based consultancy fge said retail prices of petrol and diesel prices would have been up to 6 per cent or about rs 4 higher if they had been allowed to rise in line with global prices indian pump prices have failed to keep up with the recent uptrend in crude prices ms paravaikkarasu said with the country s general elections underway the incumbent government has been keeping pump prices relatively unchanged india had switched to a daily price revision in june 2017 from a revision every two weeks as the government allowed retailers to set prices but the government faced protests last october when retailers raised prices by up to rs 10 a litre after the crude oil price went above 80 a barrel forcing it to cut fuel taxes global prices rose to their highest level in 2019 thursday days after the united states announced all iran sanction waivers would end by may pressuring importers including india to stop buying tehran s oil higher oil prices will mean asia s third largest economy is likely to see growth of less than 7 per cent rate this fiscal year economists said growth slowed to 6 6 per cent in the october december quarter the slowest in five quarters rating agency care has warned that a 10 per cent rise in global oil prices could increase demand for dollars putting pressure on the rupee and widening the current account deficit the country s oil import bill rose by nearly one third in the fiscal year ending march 31 to 140 5 billion against 108 billion the previous year the increase in international oil prices is a credit negative for the indian economy icra the indian arm of the fitch rating agency said in a note every 10 barrel increase in crude oil prices increases the fiscal deficit by about 0 1 per cent of gdp any big price rise would also build a case for the central bank to keep rates steady or even raise them the reserve bank of india s monetary policy committee which cut the benchmark policy repo rate by 25 basis points this month warned that rising oil and food prices could push up inflation policymakers are worried that a sustained increase in the oil price in the range of 70 75 barrel or higher can move the rupee down by 3 4 per cent on an annual basis the rupee has depreciated by 1 24 per cent against the dollar since a year high in mid march reuters
i m mike gleason and welcome to this week s market wrap podcast a few weeks ago we heard the first half of an interview money metals president stefan gleason did during a recent 360 gold summit today we ll hear part two of that interview stefan gives some important warnings to precious metals investors discusses why he favors one of the precious metals over the others and also talks about some really important things to consider when selecting a precious metals dealer don t miss the eye opening conclusion of stefan s interview coming up after this week s market update well the big headline in markets this week the s p 500 pushed to a new all time high in nominal terms but is it a new high in real terms most in the financial media don t want to ask that question they would rather join their wall street sponsors in celebrating a new official record president donald trump certainly didn t miss the opportunity to boast about the stock market s strength under his watch donald trump the stock market and our country from an economic standpoint is doing the best probably it s ever done we re hitting new highs again we ve hit new highs i guess close to or over 100 times since i m president from the time of the election cnbc reporter you heard the president starting off there with the stock market obviously he sees that as a piece of good news and an overall barometer for the economy under his leadership i asked the president how high he thinks the stock market can go he didn t respond to that one the trump tax cuts for corporations and his administration s relative business friendly approach to regulation have certainly given equity markets a boost but stocks have also benefited from a general rising sea of liquidity thanks to the federal reserve investors shouldn t be fooled by records that get set because of artificial stimulus from central bankers there has never been a clearer case of the federal reserve goosing the stock market than the current rally that began off last year s pre christmas lows under pressure from wall street and the white house plunge protection team to back off on rate hikes fed chairman jerome powell announced a pause earlier this spring he confirmed the pause would continue for the remainder of the year for wall street it has been perhaps the greatest pause of all time judging by the nominal gains registered over the past four months despite the celebratory mood surrounding stocks there is a striking number of what market technicians call non confirmations the transportation index hasn t hit a new high the small cap russell 2000 index is nowhere near a new high and the s p 500 itself is far short of a new high when measured against raw materials including crude oil and gold yes despite the gold market s frustratingly sluggish performance over the past few years the monetary metal has still outperformed the stock market over a longer term frame it may be hard to believe given all the current hoopla around stocks but since 2000 gold bullion has still doubled the gains of the s p 500 stocks are up big in terms of dollars in terms of hard money though it s been a lost generation for equities investors won t necessarily hear that inconvenient truth told to them by the talking heads on cnbc turning to this week s market action in precious metals gold is managing a 0 9 gain to trade at 1 289 an ounce with most of that gain coming here thanks to a bit of a friday rally silver which dropped below 15 in trading earlier this week is now a tick above it and is essentially unchanged on the week now to bring spot prices to 15 10 the platinum market shows a weekly decline of 0 8 to trade at an even 900 and finally palladium looks higher by 1 4 this week as prices check in at 1 462 per ounce and like gold with all of that gain coming here on friday metals markets faced headwinds this week from both a rising stock market and rising u s dollar index the dollar rose toward a 2 year high against its major foreign currency counterparts even as the federal reserve has turned dovish central banks around the developed world from japan to sweden to canada have turned even more dovish they are aggressively committing to ultra low interest rates in some cases even negative interest rates in the face of weak economies if this dynamic continues to push the dollar higher against foreign currencies the fed will come under increasing pressure to cut rates futures markets are currently pricing in a quarter point rate cut by the end of the year fed policymakers haven t yet signaled they will make such a move but there are signs the economy is slowing significantly enough to give them justification despite the record high stock market and historically low official unemployment rate gdp is slumping and housing is hitting the skids perhaps investor optimism toward stocks will finally begin to wane the big question is whether the next round of fed stimulus benefits primarily the stock market again or whether monetary inflation gets reflected more in other asset classes such as commodities and precious metals that question could start getting answered later this year well now without further delay let s get to this week s featured interview of money metals president stefan gleason as we listen to the conclusion of his remarks during the 360 gold summit a discussion about all things precious metals and we start off where stefan answers the important question about how to select a precious metals dealer stefan gleason you want be careful about who you are doing business with you want to do a little research probably start small with that dealer and see how it goes see how the service is see how the delivery is another place to acquire precious metals would be from a local dealer money metals exchange is a national dealer there is other several other good national dealers local dealers are a little bit more sort of unknown some are very good some are not one of the problems though buying locally is that you are often faced with sales taxes many states i think it is about 20 states actually force dealers who sell inside of their states to collect sales taxes which are significant especially when you consider that an ounce of gold might cost 5 6 7 over spot well if you add a 7 sale sales tax to that that s a huge huge markup in the context of the numbers you normally see in precious metals so that is a disadvantage that many local dealers have when compared to a national dealer but the advantage perhaps especially if you are very nervous about dealing with somebody from a long distance is that presumably you can walk out that day with your metals after having paid instead of having to wait a couple days in the mail for it to arrive on the other hand they may not be as well equipped locally to detect fakes which are not a big problem but they are out there and there may less of an education component involved but look at your options obviously our customers are buying from us many of them bought locally and then changed to us pete fetig that is a really interesting observation with the sales tax when you think about it you are actually exchanging one form of currency for real money you are not buying anything you are not selling you are exchanging stefan gleason right that is an extremely concerning subject as you pointed out you are changing one form of money paper u s dollars or coins for another form of money that is recognized by our constitution as money article 1 section 10 of the constitution sets up gold and silver as the only money that is supposed to be accepted in the states we have also obviously got away from that the idea that you would have to pay sales taxes as though it some sort of good as opposed to money could imagine if you went to the bank and had to pay sales tax to break a 10 bill into a roll of quarters i mean that is basically the equivalent gold and silver is disfavored by the sales tax laws in many states and then at the federal level you have to pay capital gains taxes when your gold and silver goes up in dollar terms but it may not have really gone up in the context of purchasing power what happened was the dollar went down so it s kind of an example of the inflation tax you are being taxed essentially through the capital gains tax on the inflation that the government is creating and so these are the public policies that we are working to spotlight and hopefully change over time that is to repeal the sales tax laws that are discriminatory against people for exchanging one form of money for a better more trusted form of money and then of course the discriminatory capital gains tax and unfortunately it is even at a higher rate than say a stock a long term capital gain on gold bullion is taxed at 28 and not 15 like you would with a gain in a stock so there are definitely some problems we can get into this in a minute that is one of the advantages of holding precious metals in your ira is that you can buy and sell without having to pay those gains every time pete fetig is there anything more important than choosing the right product and getting it for a low price stefan gleason the most important thing is getting delivery and that means getting your metal i would say that in some cases the lowest price can be a red flag if somebody is selling gold and silver for below its actual value there is probably something wrong we recently ran across somebody who had bought some gold from a bitcoin exchange and he bought it at a discount a discount to its market price well that is kind of a red flag gold and silver is not at a discount to the spot price particularly on the buy side so the lowest price is not necessarily the best safest place to go obviously there is some very good low cost dealers including money metals exchange but there s also been horror stories of low cost dealers i will mention one that went out of business tulving company they were super low no service almost kind of mean to their customers if you dealt with them eventually at one point about 2 years ago 100s of people stopped getting delivery something like 20 million worth of gold and silver was never delivered so getting a low price is no good at all if you are not actually getting your metal the most important thing is working with somebody and getting what you paid for pete fetig very true how does the average person trust a dealer or an organization that supplies the coin or bullion stefan gleason well the first thing is doing a little research you should always do that with any purchase you should know who you re dealing with when it comes to precious metal dealers the first thing i think look them up on the bbb see if there are complaints see how they have handled those complaints everybody probably can have a complaint but how they dealt with those how many they have what kind of rating they have that is one way of doing the research there is another site called bullion directory which has reviewed 100s of companies across the globe we were honored to have been named precious metals dealer of the year in the united states last year by that ratings group international ratings group those are two things you can do research the bbb and bullion directory the other thing is size them up look at their website look at the content that they have if they have an email list get on your email list and start small if you are worried about it you re not 100 sure buy a small amount and see how it goes see how good the communication is see if they provide you with transparent pricing and fast delivery do they confirm that they got your payment was their invoice exactly what you expected was it packaged well was there pride put into the way they handled everything with their customer if you have a good experience that is a really good sign obviously it is not a guarantee but you really need to pay attention to the people you are doing business with and that s just as much if not more the case when it comes to precious metals pete fetig what sort of considerations are important to make before and after acquiring stefan gleason i would say that there are a couple things that i would emphasize one is what are you going to do with it when you get it where are you going to put it how are you going to store it most of our customers probably keep it somewhere in their house a few will put it in their bank safe deposit box some will stored in a depository or at a brink s facility some will put it in their home safe but some will hide it in other unpredictable places so if you have a lot of precious metals you probably want to have some of it stored remotely because that is a lot to have in your house i do think that everybody should have the ability to get their hands on their gold and silver at least some of it very quickly if they need to so storage is one consideration some people are reluctant and i can understand why to store it in their bank safe deposit box in fact the banks are part of this war on cash and even war on precious metals some banks are saying you cannot hold gold and silver or cash in your bank safe deposit box you may be banking with one of those banks but there are also concerns from back in the 1930s fdr issued an executive order banning private gold ownership in america some people felt like the gold that they had in the safe deposit box was being disclosed and potentially seized that never actually happened but most people turned it involuntarily or many people did but there s less privacy perhaps if you hold it in the bank i think people rightly are little reluctant to do that the other thing is in addition to figure how you are going to store it and where you are going to put it is really to think about the responsibility that you have as a precious metals owner or as a person to keep your financial business to yourself a trusted person or a spouse certainly should be aware if something happens to you but you should not be talking about how you bought all this gold and silver bringing out your collection and showing it to everybody that comes and visits there s been unfortunately some really horrific situations where people have not kept her mouth shut had been talking way too much about what they own and found themselves with a home invasion or a robbery so that s the other thing figure out how you are going to store it and also discipline yourself to keep your financial business as private as possible pete fetig very good points how can the average person best understand appreciation of his holdings or the upside value stefan gleason the first reason to own gold and silver is not necessarily for these spectacular gains although i think you are going to see those at least in dollar terms the first reason is to own it as insurance and as a hedge but particularly with silver probably also with gold there is a huge potential upside even real terms right now we are seeing negative interest rates emerge in europe we are seeing 0 interest rates here in the u s one of the big knocks on gold and silver is it does not pay any interest well neither does the dollar now and then on top of that you have the devaluation of the principal when you own dollars so gold and silver are becoming very attractive assets that is particularly been evidenced in the last few months gold and silver have done extremely well so there s definitely some real potential upside to gold and silver in terms of when to get out i think that you probably want to be owning gold and silver forever a certain amount but if you re more of a speculator and you have larger amounts than you probably do want to be looking for opportunities to sell over time but i would say right now is a buying opportunity down the road you could see silver at 100 an ounce or even higher gold could be several thousand dollars an ounce before this is all over particularly if the devaluation continues and maybe you ll want to lighten your holdings right now i think you are wise to be in the accumulation mode unless you need the money because you need to liquidate for other reasons pete fetig that makes sense i guess related would be when might an average person consider liquidating his holdings are there any solid event types that might precipitate liquidating all of what you have versus only some of what you have stefan gleason if you see the u s government live within its means and the debt goes from 18 trillion down to 0 that might be a good time to seriously lighten up on precious metals i personally don t see that happening i do not think most people do i think we are locked on a path here so i think there is always going to be a significant role for precious metals in your portfolio regardless but perhaps if you saw an outbreak of sanity in washington dc and around the world and peace emerging and all these geopolitical things simmering down and terrorism going away i think it might be time to seriously consider selling a fair amount of your gold and silver but we re not in that situation the way to approach this is to not try to pick a bottom or a top it would be accumulate over time in smaller amounts don t go all in and don t sell all at once i would look at this as a way of getting on a plan and slowly and steadily increasing the number of ounces you own and then if we get down the road and you do see things changing and 40 of the american people are talking about you re getting your shoes shined and the guy is talking about owning gold and silver maybe that is the time to start selling but we are nowhere near that situation and most people are dangerously exposed in not owning any so i would get on a monthly plan and accumulate now is the time to accumulate down the road would be a time to potentially disgorge some your holdings or if you have a need for it if you re in retirement or you have some big expenses obviously you do not want to lock up all of your available cash in precious metals just do what you can over time to accumulate and i think you will be rewarded for it pete fetig and somewhat related in terms of best place to get it what about best places to liquidate it is there a type of list that would be investors might consider comparing against or going to stefan gleason well usually and certainly it s the case with money metals exchange you can sell to the same people that you buy from we ll buy anybody s gold or silver coins bars and rounds we obviously check it and ensure that it is what it is we make sure we have it in our facility before we pay the customer once we verify it but we buy back and we would love to buy back unfortunately for us most of our customers are just buying from us and very few are selling to us so we actually have to buy from mints and wholesalers and the u s mint and so forth we d love to buy more of our inventory from our customers because obviously we are buying from a middleman we do make a market probably only about 5 to 10 of our inventory is sourced from our customers we are eager to buy and we offer probably the highest or among the highest buyback prices of any of our competitors we are as eager to buy from our customers as we are to sell to our customers and that s probably the case with most dealers we are not retailers we are dealers and that means that we both and sell you probably would go back to where you bought it but you do not have to we buy stuff from people that they bought elsewhere all the time and are happy to do so the items that we deal in are very standard recognizable liquid some people may want to sell to their local dealer and that s fine too they want to walk out with the cash they may not get as good a price but it depends on what your priorities are there is no problem selling your precious metals but that s a very good question because a lot of times people say how do i sell what do i do with it it is really about as easy to sell it as it is to buy it you contact a dealer or walk into a dealer shop they offer you a price you give them the metal and they pay you it s that simple it is about the same process in reverse as when you buy from us pete fetig i m going to switch gears just a little bit here how about other precious metals like platinum palladium etc are there times when an investor should be considering acquiring those precious metals or vice versa or liquidating if they are already held stefan gleason platinum and palladiums are the other two major precious metals there s rhodium for example which is even less considered an investment asset platinum and palladium are still a very small part of the precious metals market there s less of it i should mention but it is not as big of an investment asset it is more of an industrial asset platinum and palladium are used for catalytic converters diesel and gasoline catalytic converters with automotive demand for example platinum and palladium can go up and down based on what is happening in the automotive market it is also a financial asset there are etfs now of course there are physical bars and rounds and coins of all of these including platinum and palladium but i would definitely not get into those until you have already got a significant or at least a reasonable holding of gold and silver those are the two that you want to start with platinum and palladium is a little bit more for down the road in terms of the upside again a lot of it is driven by industrial demand but they are also undervalued versus gold as i discussed earlier silver is way undervalued versus gold historically both in recent history as well as the longer term history but platinum and palladium are undervalued platinum is way below the price of 1 ounce of gold and it s typically 1 5 to 2 times the price of gold over time platinum is way undervalued versus gold but again that is really not something to jump into until after you already have a meaningful holding of gold and silver pete fetig it also sounds like something that you probably would not do until you better understood the market and price swings and so forth of the precious metals in general what about owning precious metals in your ira how does that work should you own the only physical metal or shares of metal backed by etf stefan gleason etfs again if you want to trade and you want to do in your stock account it is convenient but there these precious metals backed etfs they re really a proxy you don t own direct title to the metal you own shares of a trust that supposedly owns the metal and then there is a whole series of custodians and sub custodians and sub sub custodians involved in that kind of instrument so if you re buying gold and silver as insurance then why introduce counterparty risk into something that is supposed to be your safe asset there are reasons people want to buy that certainly it is convenient but it s not necessarily cheaper than owning it and storing it and paying the storage fees yourself there s still fees involved in the etfs i don t think that s really something people should be doing they should be buying physical gold and silver that they have direct title to pete fetig what sort of things or education can the average person do for themselves to be better prepared to consider precious metals investing stefan gleason this is something our company money metals exchanges is really big on and that is education and content we want our customers to be well informed and we want to keep them updated there are lots of websites out there but a great place is to go to moneymetals com and get on our email list we send out 2 or 3 informative articles about the markets each week pay attention get a little gold and silver in your hand start thinking about it start thinking about what it means compare it to paper money it s interesting the first time i had gold and silver my hand 20 years ago it really got the wheels turning what is this fiat money what is this federal reserve note why does it have value why do people accept it and compare that to this beautiful timeless metal of gold and silver and it really gets the wheels turning and that opened up an education process for me and i think it does a lot of people and we think the best customers are the best informed and that s certainly what we strive for i want to get back to precious metals iras that s one thing that is an area where people might be best able to put money into precious metals because they have ira accounts there something called a self directed ira you can set up an account with a self directed ira company and then work with a dealer like us and with a depository you can directly hold title your ira can directly hold title to physical metal inside of your iras that s another way of getting into this market that we definitely encourage people to look at pete fetig a lot safer than to be speculating in the stock market that is for sure is there any method to the madness in how the average person might approach what he considers owner or holding when i say that for example is there any sort of 80 20 type of rule or rules of ratio for gold to silver holdings stefan gleason i would say that the more likely you are to need to access the gold and silver and turn it into cash or liquidate out of it the more likely that that s the case probably the higher percentage that you want to have in gold gold tends to be a little more consistent it s rising but it s less of a roller coaster silver can be quite volatile when priced in dollars and of course some of that is just the volatility of the dollar itself but i would say if you re looking at a 3 to 5 year horizon then definitely favor silver if you re only going to own gold and silver for a year or 2 and think you might need to liquidate out of it then perhaps you should favor gold and have a majority of your funds in gold but this isn t something that you should be buying and selling like stock this is something you should be accumulating and not necessarily looking to liquidate it any time soon it s there if you need it do not necessarily plan on buying gold and silver if you think you are going to need the money in 6 months there are some transaction costs involved not significant if you go to the right places but that is a something to keep in mind going back to you what i said earlier silver is definitely the more potentially explosive upside metal as long as you not looking very short term i would definitely have a majority of your funds in silver but make sure you get some gold pete fetig very good well we re running up against a time constraint here i wanted to thank you for joining us and offering all of your just excellent insights and observations and answers to all the questions that we have thrown at you today before we leave though i would like to offer you the opportunity to let people know how to reach you and to contact you at money metal exchange stefan gleason thank you so much for the opportunity and hopefully i ve shown education is a big part of what we do at money metals i think when compared to other dealers that s one of our very strongest differentiating factors go to moneymetals com look at the products most importantly get on our email list and let us continue to educate you about the market we also have a monthly savings plan which you can get into where you set up a certain amount each month where we debit your bank account or whatever your instructions are and send you on a steady schedule gold and silver and that s a great way to accumulate kind of put it on auto pilot so that s available at moneymetals com as well but i certainly really appreciated the opportunity to talk about this important subject and also about a company pete fetig well thank you for joining us today and folks thanks for listening in and we hope you guys have a great day

its gross domestic product the debt now stands at more than 84 billion or roughly 152 of gdp advertisement last year s budget deficit alone reached 11 of gdp much of it for servicing the debt government employee salaries and subsidies for electricity power prices have gone unchanged since 1996 meanwhile eight years of unrest in neighboring syria and the region at large have battered economic growth this month the world bank revised its estimate for lebanon to 0 2 growth for this year down from 1 last year one lifeline is the 11 6 billion pledged last year at a donor conference in paris which brought together 50 countries and organizations including the u s france the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development to aid lebanon s decrepit infrastructure advertisement but the package which comprises 10 2 billion in loans and 860 million in grants came with tough talk from foreign officials they insisted on political and economic reforms including trimming wages for government workers and reducing the deficit by one percent a year above all they made clear the fractious lebanese government could no longer ignore its obligations the government does not have the luxury of time we must advance on several plans said france s ambassador to lebanon pierre duquesne at a news conference last month anything that can be done by the government over the coming weeks and months to confirm this will to move forward will be useful and even necessary so dire is the situation that even leaders of the nation s dysfunctional political class culled from 18 religious sects acknowledge the need for change advertisement last week lebanese prime minister saad hariri warned parliament that his government must prepare a budget that would be the most austere in the history of lebanon according to media reports if spending continued as it has the country could face economic disaster he added the statement followed similar warnings by lebanon s foreign minister gebran bassil that without a temporary reduction in wages for public servants there would be no salary left for anyone the announcements which spurred street protests followed parliament s approval of a far reaching plan to update a power grid that often leaves people in darkness advertisement meanwhile the 2019 draft budget due to be released in the coming days would target highly compensated state workers thousands of whom receive salaries higher than that of lebanon s president finance minister ali hasan khalil said in a recent interview with lebanese

working age to seek their fortunes elsewhere said marwan iskander a lebanese economic expert all of our situation is mismanagement and taking advantage of one s authority iskandar said in an interview in beirut the politicians are uninterested in the welfare of the people and there are only a few who truly understand the economy advertisement in recent months washington has ramped up sanctions targeting iran and its allies including the lebanese shiite group and political faction hezbollah which the u s considers a terrorist organization but which has a strong base of popular support and controls several key ministries in recent weeks hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah launched a charity drive to replenish the group s funds in the face of what he called a financial war waged by the u s

spurred on by the global justice movement of the late 1990s and the u s invasions and occupations of afghanistan and iraq marxists like david harvey and ellen meiksins wood have produced a flowering of theorization about capitalism and imperialism author william i robinson has been a key contributor to this new body of work in particular with his books a theory of global capitalism and global capitalism and the crisis of humanity his latest collection of essays into the tempest essays on the new global capitalism is a provocative and accessible summary of his argument that globalization which he calls the master process of our age has ushered in a new epoch of capitalism he contends that this epoch was born out of the global recession the system underwent in the 1970s up until then capitalism was a world economy divided up into hierarchically organized national economies dominated by great imperial powers like the u s to overcome the recession corporations broke out of that national framework in search of cheap labor resources and markets over the subsequent decades transnational corporations established a new global system of production finance and services in the process robinson argues a new fraction of capital emerged a transnational capitalist class that is not tied to any particular nation state their corporations run global assembly lines their boards are made up of executives from many different countries and they advocate common ideologies and policies of neoliberal globalization this fraction of capital according to robinson has created an emergent transnational capitalist state comprised of two components one international institutions like the international monetary fund the world bank the world trade organization and the united nations and two the majority of the world s nation states over which the transnational capitalist class has won hegemony he contends that the development of this new class and its new state has invalidated the classical marxist theory of imperialism developed by marxist theorists and russian revolutionaries including rudolf hilferding rosa luxemburg vladimir lenin and nikolai bukharin among others they predicted that the great powers were driven by competing interests toward rivalry and war or the division and re division of the world while robinson notes that the classical marxists ideas were accurate accounts of world capitalism in their time he argues that they can no longer explain contemporary global capitalism today the transnational capitalist class has brought an end to the tendency toward inter imperial rivalry between great powers the axis of conflict within the world system is between the 1 percent and its accomplices in the professional middle class and the 80 percent laboring majority moreover the capitalist classes of the global south have also bought into globalization and benefited from it therefore he makes the case that brazil russia india china and south africa offer neither an alternative path of development in the interests of the global south nor even a challenge to neoliberalism they are now in fact accomplices in generalizing the logic of free trade globalization a new axis of conflict thus the central axis of conflict within the world system is neither between dominant nation states nor between them and oppressed nations in the developing world but between the transnational capitalist class and the transnational working class put another way this is a conflict between the world s 20 percent the 1 percent and its accomplices in the professional middle class and the 80 percent laboring majority the conditions for this global working class are getting dramatically worse in the global north several decades of neoliberalism have driven wages down busted unions and dismantled welfare state programs introducing unprecedented precarity in the global south capitalism has plundered whole regions dispossessing peasants of their land and driving them to become migrants in search of jobs in the megacities of their home countries or to become criminalized laboring migrants deprived of the most basic human rights in advanced capitalist countries whole chunks of the population which robinson calls supernumeraries can t even find employment but sit on the margins of society in desperate poverty faced with this discontented mass of workers the transnational capitalist class uses the classic strategy of all rulers divide and conquer to pit the masses against one another they use their immigration laws to set citizens against noncitizens in what robinson calls a new rigid caste system they have also intensified and institutionalized racism islamophobia and other forms of bigotry to further split up workers and they have ramped up sexism through neoliberalism s privatized system of social reproduction which places ever more burdens on women in the home and restrictions and rollbacks on rights to everything from abortion to affirmative action but all of this has failed to stabilize the system as robinson demonstrates global capitalism has entered an epochal crisis triggered by the great recession our rulers got out of that downturn by imposing brutal austerity measures on workers throughout the world making their lives even more precarious so far the global right has gained the most ground offering authoritarian scapegoating of oppressed groups as false solutions to real grievances they launched these attacks in the hopes of triggering a new boom but they have failed the system remains mired in what professor and author david mcnally calls a global slump characterized by low rates of growth state and corporate debt and shrinking consumer demand even worse there are now signs of yet another crisis accumulating throughout the world on top of all this the system has disrupted the global climate threatening all of human society and our ecosphere it is creating superstorms exacerbating economic and social inequality and generating new waves of climate refugees fleeing natural disasters and rising sea levels all of these developments have thrown the system its states and the parties that rule them into a profound crisis of legitimacy in turn the masses of the world have radicalized staging many struggles from the arab spring to the occupy movement in the u s and in the process have turned to both the left and the right in search of alternatives to the wretched status quo so far the global right has gained the most ground offering authoritarian scapegoating of oppressed groups especially migrants as false and brutal solutions to real grievances most ominously it has opened the door to what robinson calls 21st century fascism robinson contrasts the right s success with the left which has so far failed to provide an alternative way forward social democracy as he notes long ago rejected the need for revolutionary change by backing their own imperialist states and embracing neoliberalism just think of new labour in the u k under tony blair he advanced capital s program of neoliberal restructuring of the british economy and he supported and indeed trumpeted george w bush s invasions and occupations of afghanistan and iraq robinson also points out that alternatives to social democracy also remain limited non governmental organizations remain tied to their capitalist donors which limits the reforms they can advocate to only the most superficial changes to the system and the revolutionary left is far too small and scarred either by its past association with authoritarian regimes or its sectarian habits defending the marxist theory of imperialism robinson s account of the world system today and the tasks of the new socialist movement are insightful and invaluable but his dismissal of the classical marxist theory of imperialism is overstated this theory offers key insights that help explain the existence and indeed intensification of geopolitical conflicts in our world today exemplified most clearly between the u s and china rivalry persists for three key reasons first as russian bolshevik bukharin argued in imperialism and world economy capitalism produces two tendencies one toward internationalization and another toward national concentration and in some cases fusion with a home state in the form of state capitalism which of these two dominate and their interrelationship or conflict have varied over different epochs trump s america first foreign policy is only the most recent and most extreme formulation of this ruling class consensus for example during the age of classical imperialism from the end of the 19th century through world war ii the dominant tendency was toward national concentration imperial powers competed with one another for the division and re division of the world system in the interests of their corporations since the 1970s the dominant tendency has been internationalization but not to the exclusion of national concentration indeed most multinational corporations however much they incorporate executives from various nations on their boards of directors remain based in a home nation state with dense networks of association with other nationally based corporations and continue to use their home government to prosecute their interests in the world system just think of the close relationship between u s based multinational high tech firms like apple and google which however internationally oriented lean on washington to secure their interests in international negotiations over trade investment and intellectual property rights especially when faced with competition from china s state owned and state backed corporations second even in the epoch of globalization capitalism does not grow in even fashion and has not produced a homogeneous transnational capitalist class with shared interests instead the system is subject to what russian revolutionary leon trotsky called the law of uneven and combined development some sections of the world system develop earlier than others and those can later stagnate as new developers leap ahead combining the most advanced features of the system with archaic ones inherited from pre capitalist modes of production as a result capitalism does not generate a single and increasingly undifferentiated field as robinson argues but real and in some cases profound differences between capitalist nation states economies and ruling classes third because each section of the international capitalist class even those with multinational orientations remains tied to particular nation states they must win hegemony over the middle and oppressed classes in their societies this deepens the tendency for separate and particular configurations of capitalist classes their states and national politics as a result the system even in the epoch of globalization continues to produce geopolitical conflict and inter imperial rivalry still it would be absurd to argue that all of this plays out in the same manner that it did in lenin and luxemburg s time a nuanced look at imperialism s global evolution there are specific economic and geopolitical patterns to our period that grow out of the system s logic and its history classical imperialism gave way to global superpower imperialism during the cold war and after the collapse of the soviet union it in turn was replaced first by a moment of unipolar dominance by the u s and then after the rise of new centers of capital accumulation like china and others by a new asymmetric multipolar world order the u s remains the dominant capitalist power but it is no longer unrivaled it faces as the state managers of u s imperialism recognize a major potential superpower in the form of china as well as lesser regional antagonists like russia iran and so on at the same time given the economic integration wrought by globalization and the fact that all the world s main powers possess nuclear weapons and can therefore threaten mutually assured destruction in the event of armed conflict inter imperial rivalry today tends to be expressed as geopolitics and geo economics with great powers angling for advantage while trying to avoid military conflagration as robinson notes most armed conflict tends to be that of the u s policing the crisis torn sections of the world but it does not do so in pursuit of the common aims of a transnational capitalist class as he claims but in the interest of u s s hegemony over allies and against any potential rivals to prevent them from establishing positions of political and economic strength outside the orbit of washington the politicians and state managers that run u s imperialism have made this abundantly clear in countless national security documents which from the clinton administration on aim to lock in u s dominance especially over strategic resources like middle eastern oil and prevent the rise of a peer competitor especially china trump s america first foreign policy is only the most recent and most extreme formulation of this ruling class consensus thus the classical marxist theory of imperialism helps us understand why the u s and china are in conflict over everything from trade intellectual property rights islands and the strategic waterways in asia 5g technology and beijing s massive belt and road initiative it s also important as a guide to action for the new socialist movement to oppose not just global capitalism but also u s imperialism and its lesser rivals like china and russia these powers have found themselves on opposite sides in conflicts over popular revolts from below for example against regimes like bashar al assad s in syria russia iran and other states backed the assad regime against the masses while the u s tried to cynically manipulate the revolt for its own aims mainly to wipe out isis also known as daesh this reality puts the left in a position of having to take a stand on the policies of these rival imperial and sub imperial powers and on popular revolts in states outside the u s sphere of influence tragically many on the left sided with the assad regime russia and iran as a supposedly anti imperialist camp standing up to the u s and slandered the revolution as a color revolution orchestrated by washington no doubt robinson as an internationalist would oppose such campism and stand with popular revolts from below but because his theoretical framework downplays inter imperial rivalry it cannot help the left think through concrete questions like the different states positions on syria why they are in conflict and what stance the left should adopt toward them and the popular revolution for that we must return to correct develop and apply the insights of the classical marxist theory of imperialism my disagreements with robinson however should not obscure the strengths of his book it offers insightful analyses of the development of globalization the authoritarian turn of states throughout the world the brutal assault on migrants and the system s epochal economic and ecological crises lastly it holds forth the hope of building a new left across borders that can help lead a new international movement for reforms on the road to ecosocialism this book should be read discussed and debated as part of developing new

the s p 500 index reached its highest level on record despite the positive news this week the u s economy continues to face some headwinds the first quarter headline rate of growth was stronger than most analysts had expected but underlying details of economic growth were not quite as strong as the headline growth rate suggests this week s data support our expectation for the fed to refrain from raising rates for the foreseeable future data reaffirm fed patience economic data out the gate this week were broadly positive u s real gdp grew at an annualized rate of 3 2 in q1 2019 durable goods orders rebounded in march and the s p 500 index reached its highest level on record despite the positive news this week the u s economy continues to face some headwinds the first quarter headline rate of growth was stronger than most analysts had expected and it represents a pick up in growth relative to q4 but as we discussed in this morning s gdp report underlying details of economic growth were not quite as strong as the headline growth rate suggests first quarter growth was driven by a surge in inventories and a large contribution from net trade underlying consumption was weak however with final sales to private domestic purchases rising just 1 3 that suggests at least some of the 128 billion build in inventories was unintentional inventory accumulation should fall back in coming quarters as a result which would exert a headwind on the overall rate of gdp growth at that time the one caveat here however is the plausible build from the boeing s 737 max aircraft which while being produced but not delivered is expected to boost q2 inventories for additional detail of the economic impact from the 737 max please see our special report weaker consumer data in recent months sparked fear among analysts that the consumer had gone into hiding we have long maintained the view that the weakness was a soft patch and not the start of a broad retrenchment in consumption that said as was expected real personal consumption expenditures pce slowed in the first quarter rising only 1 2 but with the 1 6 surge in march retail sales and consumer sentiment data stabilizing consumption ended the first quarter on a solid note which provides some momentum headed into q2 fixed investment spending was up only 1 5 in the first quarter but investment too may accelerate in coming quarters as durable goods orders data for march suggest capital spending may be picking up net exports provided a sizable boost adding 1 0 percentage point to the overall rate of gdp growth in q1 which is among the largest positive contributions this component has made this cycle exports grew a modest 3 7 but imports fell 3 7 as domestic demand strengthens real imports are expected to rebound in coming quarters but this will exert a drag on growth although the economy may not have been as strong in q1 as the headline gdp growth rate suggests the economy is not in danger of stalling anytime soon that said this week s data support our expectation for the fed to refrain from raising rates for the foreseeable future as we have highlighted the underlying details were not as strong as the headline rate of gdp growth suggests further the core pce deflator rose at an annualized rate of just 1 3 in the first quarter with the fed s preferred measure of consumer price inflation remaining below its objective of 2 it seems likely that the fomc will be happy to remain on the sideline watching the incoming data for further reading of our expectations regarding next week s fomc meeting please see

changed on balance in april while the preliminary markit manufacturing pmi was unchanged as a result we look for the ism to come in close in line with its april print at 55 1 an upside surprise would signal to the fomc that the headwinds to the outlook from the trade and global growth environment are easing and could spur speculation that the fomc s next move will be tightening the ism non

wednesday next week s fomc meeting will not be followed up by fresh economic projections but it will be concluded by a press conference with chair powell closely watched in the statement will be whether the fomc continues to pledge patience in determining future adjustments to policy removing patient could give the fomc more flexibility at future meetings however if not carefully communicated it could be construed that the fomc is gearing up to hike again given an improvement in recent data which could lead to a tightening in financial conditions of interest in the press conference will be the way in which conditions would need to change for the fomc to alter its policy stance either direction given current expectations for it to remain on hold we view inflation as the key condition to get the fomc tightening again but a cut would also depend on renewed tightening in financial conditions and growth slowing below trend previous 2 25 2 50 wells fargo 2 25 2 50 consensus 2 25 2 50 employment friday after wild swings to start the quarter payroll growth settled down in march with employers adding 196k jobs hiring of temporary workers has slowed the past few months and points to

same goes for a new cycle low in jobless claims in april although the drop was likely exaggerated by the late timing of easter this year upside or downside if payrolls come in well wide of consensus

global review global growth concerns continue to linger at its meeting this past week monetary policymakers in canada left their main policy rate unchanged and dropped a reference to future rate

below 2 for the first time since 2009 the bank of japan rounded out the week by reaffirming its extraordinarily easy stance of monetary policy and signaling that the current policy of holding both short and long term rates near zero would continue through at least the spring of 2020 global growth concerns continue to linger like the federal reserve the bank of canada boc has been a developed economy central bank that has succeeded in bringing its main policy rate up in recent years see chart on front page strong employment growth a steady closing of the output gap and core inflation that remained in the ballpark of 2 helped the boc chart a course with more tightening than most at its meeting this past week however the boc seemed to bring its language in line with the dovish mindset that has taken hold at most major central banks of late monetary policymakers in canada left their main policy rate unchanged and dropped a reference to future rate increases that had been in every statement since the end of 2017 the bank also cut its growth forecast for 2019 by half a percentage point to 1 2 from 1 7 the headwinds in canada have been strong recently in its statement the boc acknowledged that global economic growth had slowed by more than the bank forecast in january oil s swoon over the winter has also been a hurdle as has continued trade uncertainty especially as it relates to nafta and its possible heir apparent the usmca making matters worse canadian households appear to finally be feeling the weight of their significant debt burdens unlike households in the united states households in canada continued to see leverage as a share of the economy rise during this expansion top chart much of the debt growth occurred as a result of a frothy housing market but of late home price appreciation has slowed dramatically both we and the boc believe growth should stabilize around 1 5 2 0 later this year but given the challenges it looks increasingly like any additional policy tightening is a ways away real gdp growth in south korea unexpectedly contracted 1 4 on a sequential annualized basis in q1 2019 bringing the year over year pace below 2 for the first time since 2009 middle chart south korea is a country heavily integrated into global trade particularly to china total exports are about 44 of south korean gdp and nearly 25 of korean exports are to china export volumes fell 2 6 on a sequential basis in q1 steeper than the 1 5 fall in q4 2018 investment spending was also soft gross fixed capital formation declined 8 4 year over year accelerating the 3 8 dip seen in q4 2018 better economic data out of china and the united states korea s second largest trading partner bode well for the second half outlook but the recent weakness in south korea could be perceived as another sign that the global economy is not out of the woods yet the bank of japan boj rounded out the week by reaffirming its extraordinarily easy stance of monetary policy the boj added a new forward guidance element to its policy statement signaling that the current policy of holding short and long term rates near zero would continue through at least the spring of 2020 with policy options more limited in japan than perhaps any other developed economy it appears the boj is turning to forward guidance to provide additional stimulus and boost inflation which remains mired below 2 bottom chart global outlook eurozone gdp tuesday economic growth in the eurozone has slowed markedly real gdp growth was just 1 2 year over year in q4 2018 the slowest pace since q4 2013 gdp data for the first quarter will be released next tuesday and the monthly indicator data point to some stabilization but not a full turnaround retail sales have rebounded solidly in the first two months of the first quarter after december s inexplicably weak reading and the services pmi appears to have found a floor in the 51 52 range though still negative on a year ago basis industrial production growth has also been a bit better of late still it appears economic growth is likely to come in around a relatively weak 1 pace both on a year over year basis and as a compound annual growth rate for the quarter it will likely take more than a stabilization around current growth rates to convince policymakers at the european central bank that the next move will be for tightening monetary policy rather than additional stimulus previous 0 2 consensus 0 3 quarter over quarter not annualized china pmis monday wednesday in late march and early april stronger pmi readings out of china helped assuage some concerns about a significant slowdown in the country to start 2019 hard data reported a couple weeks later showed real gdp growth was steady at 6 4 in q1 2019 suggesting the government s stimulus efforts have helped prevent a sharp slowdown in the near term we have believed for some time that chinese policymakers would do what it takes to keep economic growth from slowing too sharply even with the measures taken thus far however the data are still far from robust both the official and the private caixin pmis for manufacturing are only a bit above the key 50 level some additional improvement in the data would be welcome but for both structural and trade related reasons we expect chinese economic growth to continue slowing in the quarters ahead just at a relatively controlled pace previous 50 5 mfg official 50 8 mfg caixin consensus 50 6 mfg official 51 0 mfg caixin bank of england meeting thursday the bank of england boe has kept monetary policy on hold for an extended period of time while awaiting the resolution of the brexit knot originally due to clear a major hurdle on march 29 two extensions later and the u k now has until october 31 to sort out how to proceed with leaving the european union this likely leaves monetary policymakers still stuck in limbo the bank of england has appeared poised to hike rates for months but has been held back by the uncertainty related to brexit the output gap appears mostly closed in the united kingdom and inflation is right around the 2 target the boe also noted in its last statement that with wage growth around 3 5 and continued weakness in productivity growth growth in unit wage costs has risen with so much uncertainty still at play however we believe the boe will probably keep its main policy rate on hold until next year previous 0 75 wells fargo 0 75 consensus 0 75 point of view interest rate watch rates are unmoved by stronger gdp the first quarter s surprisingly robust 3 2 annualized real gdp growth was not nearly as strong as the headline indicated growth was bolstered by an abrupt turnaround in international trade and surge in inventories neither of which is likely to continue in the second quarter top line growth also benefitted from a surge in state and local government spending which was largely highway and road work delayed during the unusually rainy fall months final sales to private domestic purchasers which is a more accurate measure of final demand in the economy rose at just a 1 3 pace the paltry gain in final domestic demand explains why inflationary pressures cooled during the first quarter even though headline growth appeared to have surged the pce deflator slowed to just 1 4 year over year during the first quarter at this point of the expansion the financial markets and the fed are more concerned about where the economy and inflation are headed than where they have been the underlying data suggests economic growth is slowing and inflation is decelerating which at a minimum should keep the fed on hold treasury yields declined following the gdp release we still see the fed s next move as a rate cut but not until the fourth quarter of 2020 we expect to see the fed focus a great deal on the deceleration in core inflation at next week s fomc meeting the year over year change in the core pce deflator has slowed from 2 2 a year ago to just 1 3 currently even though real gdp growth has risen 3 2 over this time period and the unemployment rate has fallen 0 2 percentage points to 3 8 inflation expectations also remain contained slower global growth and heightened uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations with china and europe are also top of mind for the financial markets and the fed slower global growth appears to be weighing on the u s manufacturing sector although the downside risks appear to have eased more recently moreover data on orders production and employment have so far proved surprisingly resilient credit market insights the fed and financial markets the s p 500 rose to an all time high this past tuesday as financial markets have enjoyed one of the best starts to the year in decades the s p is up nearly 25 since bottoming out at the end of december investment grade credit spreads have fallen 50 bps since december back to the levels averaged over most of 2018 while high yield credit spreads have fallen over 150 bps remaining slightly above their 2018 average financial markets have been more than happy to embrace the fomc s monetary policy pivot after its recognition at its january meeting of the tightening of financial conditions and the associated downside risks to the u s economic outlook that had emerged since the fall fast forward to the march meeting and the fomc explicitly attributed the financial market rebound to the perceived shift in the fomc s approach to policy following communications stressing that the committee would be patient with the next fomc meeting on tuesday one week after the s p reached a record high will it deem a further pause appropriate or has the major impetus for its pivot sufficiently dissipated we think it was not the financial market sell off per se that drove the fomc to pause but rather the fact that the markets were signaling their displeasure with perceived insufficient policy flexibility taking this lesson to heart the fomc is now facing persistently sub 2 inflation and unresolved global risks that together justify further patience despite investors rediscovered exuberance topic of the week where has all the volatility gone back in december financial markets encountered significant turbulence however volatility has receded markedly so far this year for example the vix index which measures volatility in the stock market has trended significantly lower since the beginning of the year top chart volatility indices in the foreign exchange market have also receded bottom chart and the yield on the 10 year treasury security has fluctuated in a narrow 20 bps range in recent weeks what s causing the drop in financial market volatility for starters central banks have turned dovish this year the federal reserve contributed to the spike in volatility in december when the fomc continued to signal that it likely would raise rates significantly further this year however most fomc members now believe that no further tightening will be needed in 2019 and the european central bank recently pushed back its projected date of lift off the bank of england likely will be on hold as long as uncertainty about brexit continues to linger trade tensions among some of the largest economies of the world have also died down this year we have no idea how long financial market volatility will remain suppressed but there are a number of potential catalysts that could trigger a return of volatility first the fed could potentially turn less dovish if economic data in coming months come in stronger than expected and or if inflation moves markedly higher then fomc members may become less sanguine about the outlook for monetary policy second the commerce department submitted a report to president trump on february 17 on whether auto imports constitute a national security threat to the united states the president needs to decide by may 18 what action if any the administration will take if president trump decides to impose tariffs on auto imports american trading partners e g germany and japan could retaliate with tariffs on american goods a trade war with those countries should one ensue would surely lead to higher volatility in financial markets stay tuned

then chris will provide a review of our first quarter results and our updated 2019 outlook after that we ll open up the call for questions patrick patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer thanks bill and good morning everyone to begin 2019 barnes group generated a solid quarter in the face of challenging headwinds in certain of our important end markets the ability of the company to deliver such performance speaks to the strength of our growth strategy and to the benefits derived from our ongoing portfolio transformation our focus on being a world class provider of highly engineered products differentiated industrial technologies and innovative solutions across many industries allows us to weather such challenges and while we re not immune to economic or market pressures efforts to broaden our end markets into new applications such as personal care medical packaging and automation allow us to power forward in the first quarter that dynamic is clearly evident as strength in our aerospace segment and certain end markets in our industrial segment helped to offset softness in other parts of industrial first quarter revenues grew 3 with organic sales up 1 adjusted operating income declined 4 while adjusted operating margin fell 90 basis point to 14 5 given market softness experienced in some of our better margin businesses adjusted earnings per share were 0 71 down 0 01 from a year ago let me now talk about our business performance in various end markets beginning with industrial where total sales were down 1 and organic sales declined 4 at molding solutions sales declined 10 over last year s first quarter while organic sales declined 3 softness in demand for automotive hot runners was driven by delays in automotive model changes and new model introductions primarily as a result of uncertainty caused by ongoing trade and tariff concerns accordingly order activity has been muted although march quoting activity has improved and our expectation is for that momentum to build throughout 2019 our internal view aligns with industry expectations for second half improvement following the soft start at the beginning of the year our molds business on the other hand continues to benefit from strong demand in personal care and medical markets collectively these businesses achieved over a 20 increase in organic sales over last year s first quarter and strong sales performance is expected to continue throughout the year so for molding solutions overall we continue to anticipate full year organic growth to be approximately flat as compared to 2018 at force motion control this newly formed sbu serves 2 primary end markets tool and die approximately 60 of sales and general industrial approximately 40 of sales within the tool and die end market delays of new programs have resulted in softness providing a commercial buffer our general industrial end market has shown strength overall orders are down year over year and organic sales were flat however on a sequential basis relative to the fourth quarter both organic orders and sales have improved our expectation is that the market is stabilizing and we anticipate improvement in the second half for 2019 we now anticipate total sales to be up low single digits and organic growth to be approximately flat both slightly lower as compared to our previous outlook at engineered components organic sales declined 7 as the auto production market weighed on performance while global auto production remains at a relatively high level we do expect 2019 production to be down approximately 1 our 2 largest regions north america and europe are both expected to see a second consecutive year of modest decline offsetting auto softness to a degree are general industrial and other transportation markets for 2019 our revenue outlook anticipates organic growth to be down low single digits consistent with our prior view at automation our integration efforts are progressing well we are diligently working our global growth initiatives advancing new end of arm tooling technologies and leveraging customer relationships through our molding solutions businesses we continue to work our pipeline of potential acquisition opportunities in automation as we look to expand our business in this market in early 2019 we ve seen lower than anticipated revenues primarily from softness in new automotive programs for the full year we now expect automation sales to be approximately 62 million at the lower end of our previous range overall our full year organic revenue outlook for the industrial segment remains in line with 2018 levels forecasted adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the low teens down slightly from our prior view to wrap up my discussion on industrial our ongoing analysis on the demand environment has our teams squarely focused on upside opportunities while closely managing costs in order to better align our production with current market conditions this has necessitated the implementation of a wide range of cost saving initiatives including adjustments to the workforce we will continue to analyze our competitive position in the industries we serve and we look to take further actions as needed moving to aerospace excellent execution and strong industry fundamentals have provided another quarter of record revenues and operating profit total sales were up 11 as compared to a year ago as ramping leap engine programs drove oem growth in the high single digits while strength for both mro and spare parts drove mid teen sales growth in the aftermarket operating margin in the segment was very strong at 21 7 up 160 basis points from last year we continue to be confident about the aerospace market and our position within the industry as strong commercial aircraft deliveries are forecasted to continue over the next several years and demand for aftermarket services and spare parts especially on programs like the cfm56 remain robust for oem as it relates to the grounding of the boeing 737 max we do not anticipate any meaningful impact in the short term for this aircraft most of our content is on the leap b engine for which our customer expects no changes in production cadence at this time however we will continue to monitor the situation closely for the full year we forecast aerospace revenues to increase in the mid to high single digits with operating margins in the low 20 range oem sales growth is anticipated to be up high single digits consistent with our prior view for the aftermarket mro growth is now anticipated to be up mid single digits and spare parts up mid to high single digits each stronger than our february outlook so to conclude we believe that 2019 overall will be another year of revenue growth for barnes group sustained aerospace strength is expected to continue while improvement with industrial is anticipated to gain momentum in the second half we ll continue to strategically invest in our businesses looking to support growth opportunities over the long term and enabling us to respond quickly to improving conditions our resolve to deliver on performance commitments and to create long term value for our stakeholders remains steadfast now let me turn the call over to chris for a discussion on the financial details christopher j stephens thank you patrick and good morning everyone let me begin with highlights of our first quarter results on slide 4 of our supplement and then move to a discussion on our updated outlook for 2019 for the first quarter sales were 377 million up 3 over the prior year period organic sales growth was 1 with a negative fx impact of 3 and a positive 5 contribution from our igs and gimatic acquisitions operating income was 50 6 million down 11 excluding 4 million of gimatic short term purchase accounting adjustments adjusted operating income declined 4 to 54 6 million adjusted operating margin was 14 5 down 90 basis points interest expense was 5 1 million up 1 2 million from a year ago due to an increase in our outstanding debt as a result of the gimatic acquisition partially offset by a lower average interest rate other expense of 1 8 million was essentially unchanged from last year with respect to taxes the company s effective tax rate was 22 3 for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 23 9 for the prior year period net income was 34 million or 0 65 per diluted share compared to 38 8 million or 0 72 per diluted share a year ago excluding 0 06 of gimatic short term purchase accounting adjustments in the current quarter adjusted net income per share was 0 71 down 1 with respect to share count our fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 52 2 million shares we did not repurchase shares in the first quarter under our existing authorization but on the related note this week board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 5 million shares of barnes group common stock and this action adds an additional 3 5 million shares to the remaining 1 5 million shares under the 2016 stock repurchase authorization for the quarter cash provided by operating activities was 53 million versus 30 million last year primarily driven by working capital improvements which was a source of cash this year versus a use of cash a year ago free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less capital expenditures was 39 million compared to 19 million last year first quarter capital expenditures were 13 7 million up 2 5 million over last year with respect to the balance sheet our debt to ebitda ratio was 2 5x down slightly from year end under our existing debt covenants additional borrowing of 340 of approximately 340 million of senior debt would be allowed one detailed item related to the balance sheet is with the adoption and of the new lease accounting guidance you ll note a 30 million increase in other assets for the establishment of right of use assets and a corresponding increase in accrued and other liabilities to reflect the lease liability moving now to our segment performance beginning with industrial in the first quarter sales were 243 million down 1 from last year organic sales decreased 4 primarily due to continued softness in our automotive end markets both production oriented and model changes unfavorable fx decreased sales by 5 while igs and gimatic contributed a combined 7 of acquisition revenues in the current quarter we received commercial settlement of a patent related matter benefiting revenues by 2 6 million operating profit was 21 5 million down 34 primarily driven by the impacts of lower organic sales volumes unfavorable productivity driven by the costs associated with the workforce a reduction in workforce and short term purchase accounting adjustments as noted in our press release the operating profit benefit of the commercial settlement in force motion control substantially offset the workforce reduction costs in the quarter excluding gimatic short term purchase accounting adjustments in the current quarter adjusted operating profit of 25 5 million was down 21 and adjusted operating margin was 10 5 down 270 basis points moving to aerospace first quarter results were once again very solid with sales of 134 million up 11 oem sales increased 9 given the ramp of new engine programs and aftermarket sales increased 16 from sustained strength in both our mro and spare part businesses operating profit was 29 1 million or 20 from the profit contribution of higher sales volumes operating margin was 21 7 which was up 160 basis points from 20 1 a year ago so a very clean quarter with sales leverage delivering the performance aerospace total backlog ended the quarter at 817 million up 10 compared from a year ago and down 5 sequentially from 2018 year end for oem specifically backlog decreased to 804 million from 845 million at year end though remains very healthy we did see some out year order activity moving around which we view as normal customer order management and anticipate much of that to come back we expect to ship approximately 50 of our aerospace backlog over the next 12 months turning to our updated 2019 outlook on slide 5 of our supplement we continue to expect total revenue growth of 4 to 6 with organic sales growth of 1 to 3 fx to negatively impact revenues by approximately 1 and acquisition revenues to contribute approximately 4 adjusted operating margin is now forecasted to be in the range of 15 5 to 16 down slightly from our previous view adjusted eps is now expected to be in the range of 3 23 to 3 35 approximately flat to up 4 from 2018 s adjusted eps of 3 22 we still expect our earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year with a 45 first half 55 second half split interest expense is anticipated to be approximately 20 million a bit more favorable than our prior view a few other items none of which have changed from our previous guidance is the effective tax rate is forecasted to be between 23 5 and 24 5 our capex expectation is for 60 million to 65 million average diluted shares are forecasted to be in the range between 51 million and 52 million shares and cash conversion is forecasted to be greater than 100 so in summary the sustained strength of our aerospace is helping to overcome softness in some of our industrial end markets as necessary actions have and will be taken to ensure the business cost structure for today s economic realities we have deep conviction in our growth strategy and with strong cash generation and ongoing investments to propel growth we believe that barnes group is well positioned to perform as certain of our industrial end markets regain strength and build momentum casey we will now open the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and your first question comes from edward marshall with sidoti company please go ahead your line is open edward marshall sidoti company analyst hey good morning guys how is everyone so i wanted to start with industrial and specifically the margin with the productivity within barnes enterprise and your end market mix and maybe some higher margin businesses including the automation i m surprised you came in around 10 5 in q1 one is there anything isolated to the q1 numbers i did i think i heard you say kind of low teens for the full year which suggests maybe this is the low point but can you kind of walk me through some of the dynamics that may have impacted q1 and your outlook for the full year patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer absolutely so q1 ed i would suggest was impacted primarily by our automotive hot runner business as well as tool and die to a lesser extent with so 2 higher margin businesses which saw some significant pressure in the quarter and subsequently what you see is in the margins that flowed through to the overall results what you have with synventive which is the hot runner business automotive hot runner business they are the market leader in that space and as a result with the deferral of model changes and new model introductions they really took the brunt of it so to speak so those two are really the contributor and the corresponding impact of those lower volumes from a top line perspective flowing through to the bottom edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and you talked about a second half improvement in both hot runners as well as in the tool and die kind of comments as you worked through the quarter january through march and maybe even now that we re into april can you talk about the cadence of orders have you seen kind of at least the maybe the flattening out of the decline and or pickup for the second half of the year patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer it s a great point and what we saw specifically in our tool and die business was effectively a stabilizing effect throughout the quarter and so that coupled with continued feedback from the customer base is such that the general consensus is one of which is first quarter represents what they think is the low point and at that low point as you said throughout the quarter we saw a stabilization in terms of orders on the synventive our hot runner side the automotive hot runner side what we saw was a slow start to the year in january or february and then a pickup began in march in terms of quoting activity so we saw an uplift toward the end of the quarter but clearly a slow start in january and february edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and the low teen guidance that i think you said for the margin on the industrial how much of that do i call it a recovery i don t know but how much of that is related to the market and how much of that is related to maybe your cost saving programs i m just trying to get a sense as to where to build the confidence behind those things patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer yes well to your point there s a it s a combination of the two and as noted in our prepared remarks you see that we did take some charges in the first quarter in terms of looking to align the businesses commensurate to what we see as the outlook for revenues for the rest of the year so with that we will see savings come back through the end through the rest of the year and also we ll continue to monitor that closely so as we continue to monitor performance over the course of each month and if that doesn t align with what our expectations are we will act accordingly that said we are looking to the back half of the year as an uptick in terms of the market as well primarily within the automotive side of the business particularly in terms of model refreshes and model launches being released and we ve gotten good indications from our customers in that respect as well where the teams are actively engaged with the customers talking about programs that they want to bring to fruition to the second half of the year and they want to be sure that we re prepared for them operator your next question comes from michael ciarmoli with suntrust please go ahead your line is open michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking the questions maybe not the hard part on it but i m probably going to stay on the same line of questions as ed here i mean just can you guys i think when you gave the initial guidance for 2019 last quarter you talked about embedding some sort of resolution on trade and tariffs is that still the expectation for this year in kind of driving some of that second half improvement patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer good morning yes we believe that the current disputes and the ongoing negotiations with another delegation heading away at the end of this week as you know and then subsequent chinese delegation expected here in the first couple of weeks of may we re encouraged by that level of activity and so we are in the camp that there will be a resolution to some of these disputes and with that not that there will be an immediate lift of those tariffs but that there will be a lift of the uncertainty that s hanging over our customer base with a view to them moving forward with more confidence in terms of their business investments michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst so when do you guys need to when does the lack of a trade resolution become a risk to the guidance patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer we ll continue to monitor yes we ll continue monitor throughout the year but right now we have it s baked in into the second half of the year has been a contributor to the uplift and that s in our guidance christopher j stephens and mike i would add to that that it s relatively shorter cycle businesses so we would both from our nitrogen gas products business that s being impacted as well as the automotive hot runner side is that when that spigot turns on if you will we would expect the order activity to increase and you re talking anywhere from maybe 3 to 6 months of us realizing the benefits of that uptick so we re coming here to the end of april may and june will be very important we clearly are still relying on that second half recovery which is our 45 55 split on the eps side but i did just want to reiterate that that is shorter cycle not terribly long cycle and we would expect that could bounce back pretty quick at least that s our expectation michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst okay it just seems like some of the other bigger bellwethers out there are calling for continued pressure and i m just trying to get a sense you re calling it short cycle so i guess there still isn t much visibility into that second half i mean you ve obviously got the aero backlog but most of this is going to be shorter cycle that could move in flux with the global markets here patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer so if you look at what makes up our business mike relative to our outlook in terms of where the strength is coming from and where the confidence is coming from in end markets that we re serving what you heard me mention was that in the first quarter we saw a 20 plus organic growth in our mold side of the business within molding solutions and there that s been driven by medical and personal care end markets so we re seeing some really nice strength coming from that business and continued order activity as well which it s a little longer cycle than the short cycle businesses chris referenced but nonetheless the team is remains very confident in terms of the order activity that s coming through and the quoting activity in that business and because we have a stronger backlog on the mold side versus the hot runners which are more short cycle we get a little bit more greater visibility in that regard and then with the aerospace side of the house as you know we ve gone from strength to strength and the team there has just executed flawlessly and they expect that to continue throughout the year as has the aftermarket continued to be buoyant as well and that clearly has helped michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst okay and then last one and i ll get out of the way here just on industrial geographically any notable changes in europe in apac i mean are you seeing any based on current booking rates are you seeing improvements in any geographies are you seeing continuation in trends any erosion any color you can provide there patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer sure with regard to the 3 regions north america i would argue has been the most stable in terms of just continues to be where we see general industrial as an example continuing to hold on its own we ve seen downward pressure in europe and in the fourth quarter coming into the first part of the year we saw a lot of pressure in china the good news with china again is that we re seeing that activity pick back up toward the back end of the quarter and so in terms of where we ve seen the most pressure i would categorize it as asia europe second and to the positive north america michael ciarmoli suntrust analyst got it thanks a lot guys i ll jump back in queue patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer thank you operator your next question come from christopher glynn with oppenheimer please go ahead your line is open christopher j stephens yeah thank you good morning patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer good morning chris christopher j stephens good morning chris so curious about your comments about synventive getting good indications from customers with respect to the second half curious how you characterize how tangible those conversations tend to be versus speculative element because the customers stay engaged with what they might do as well as what they re going to do patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer i think the teams our sales teams and the business leaders are actively engaged with the major customers in each of the regions on a weekly basis and to that end they feel confident that these discussions are grounded more in intent to move forward as opposed to the speculative side of ensuring the capacity is there i think the question of capacity isn t an issue it s whether will our business and will the industry be ready once there is an uptick as opposed to having maybe contracted or restrained itself to the extreme christopher j stephens and if it pushes out further would you describe prospective linearity as that much more in 2020 on a hypothetical basis patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer i would suggest that as we look toward and again recognize we re looking to just a certain number of our businesses that touch particularly the automotive end market and there those businesses are making adjustments on multiple fronts so i talked about managing costs and utilizing the barnes enterprise system even more with a view to driving internal productivity but then also in terms of outlook if we see a shift we see that shift moving into 2020 in the sense of if you re saying that it doesn t come in other words we re not seeing any or have any conversations around cancellations it s more about delays or deferrals christopher j stephens okay and then switching to the aero aftermarket your 16 growth compares to 19 the prior year and even stronger from the first quarter of 17 clearly momentum is very resilient and ongoing here it suggests the guidance is conservative i m wondering if you re seeing a cf6 correction coming maybe and also if there is any particular quarter we should be aware of where the run rate comes to aftermarket or an obvious disruptive 3 months patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer well to your point we saw another great quarter in the first quarter of 19 with mid teens for aftermarket overall how that broke down was high teens to the spares side of the business and low teens to the mro side in each then i would say that both aspects of the industry fundamentals that are driving those results continue to be positive as you know our heavy emphasis or volume comes from the cfm in our guidance we do hedge a little bit against the cf6 because it has been stronger than what i would suggest was anticipated from an industrywide perspective and that of course is a result of the cf6 aircraft powered aircraft being pulled back into service given the high volumes of both freight and passenger that s occurring over the last couple of years so how long will that go is a has a question mark on it nonetheless the cfm we see it as continuing from strength to strength with a view to it peaking in the early to mid 20s christopher j stephens and any particular quarters to be aware of where the comps just fundamentally just for modeling purposes anything any particular quarter we need to dial down the growth estimate patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer i think the q1 was i thought was a stronger quarter than we even anticipated and so to that end we ve moderated our expectations into the final 3 quarters of the year but there s no one quarter that has any seasonality to it if you like but we clearly are starting to patch it up on our own comps as you know we ve had 2 strong years and so the comps have moderated to kind of sustain at the levels that s been going christopher j stephens okay and my last one here you commented on the press release about adapting as needed to deliver on commitments seems to be you re suggesting you feel the updated guidance ringfences the risk i think you ve learned a lot about the automotive markets in the last 3 or 4 months and the linearity there so wonder if you could react to the notion of ringfencing the risks pretty well there patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer i would say that as i mentioned before we re going to continue to monitor closely all aspects of our business whether it s aerospace and or whether it s industrial and to that end i d reference because it is front and center even on the aerospace side you do have the one boeing 737 situation that s there and so i didn t want to suggested that we re unscathed by that if it continued that said as you know it s smaller piece of our portfolio with the industrial side we re looking at the current projections we ve worked diligently with the businesses in terms of the buildup to our guidance with i think a fair reflection of both risks and opportunities and to that end i think we have it ringfenced at the same time i did put out there that we will if we see anything to the positive or negative we ll react accordingly operator your next question comes from myles walton with ubs please go ahead your line is open myles walton ubs analyst thanks good morning christopher j stephens good morning mike myles walton ubs analyst patrick maybe as a whole end market on auto can you talk about what it was down in the quarter and then what you expected for the full year and then also maybe address the notion that i think you ve talked previously about the molding solutions or the product model changeovers is being more resilient to downturns is that playing out or not here it does seem like molding solutions auto exposures may be down more than the production side patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer yes so i would suggest that our automotive business overall has seen for the complete portfolio we ve been in the mid to high teens down and then within the portfolio there are other parts of the businesses that have been down in the 20s plus dollars have been in the low teens relative to and i would suggest that that s been across the board regionally between north america europe and china with china a little bit more under pressure when i reference the 20s because just what we saw slowdown wise over the fourth quarter bleeding into the first quarter so as we talked about the automotive hot runners being more resilient than direct production clearly what we ve seen in the last number of months is that the model changes have i would argue have been impacted more severely than auto production as a result of the tariff and the trade concerns that are existing and so what we ve seen is a pullback by the oems with respect to launching programs that have been well into the whole design process but just haven t released and so i think there s been an alignment of factors that in this current period has actually impacted the model changes greater than actual auto production and subsequently why our automotive hot runners business has seen the brunt of that as supposed to even we ve seen a lesser impact on our direct auto production businesses and our tool and die business myles walton ubs analyst and that mid teens declines in auto is a market you ve kind of seen this past quarter do you expect that to exit the year at a flat paced so kind of in line with the down 1 production or kind of what s baked in in terms of maybe the slope of your recovery here patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer we re looking at a modest increase in q2 and then a sequential improvement in q3 and q4 myles walton ubs analyst okay and then the other one the 2020 margin targets you updated last quarter should we roll through the 50 basis point reduction from this year into those targets or do you anticipate you d be able to recover all of the all that back and maintain the 17 to 18 you talked about last quarter christopher j stephens yes no that s a good question we look at the continued strength at aerospace the adjustments we ve made to our outlook and operating margin with aerospace now being in the low 20 range but at the same time industrial now being more in the low teens we still have that outlook to hit what we had said in february time frame continue to manage those costs clearly some of the end markets in this particular case which is dominating the phone call here is the automotive end market needs to recover needs to rebound and we need to build that momentum evident that if that does not for whatever reason that puts pressure on that 2020 objective but we re still focused on achieving it operator your next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson please go ahead your line is open matt summerville da davidson analyst could you give a little bit more order granularity in the industrial business perhaps talk by sbus what you saw in terms of incoming order rates in the first quarter and then about the backlog in industrial was at the end of q1 patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer so relative to orders and i ll talk orders to sales relative to each of the businesses for the first quarter what we saw in engineered components was a book to bill of 0 95 in force motion control a book to bill of 1 and in molding solutions a book to bill of 1 with that for industrial in total also been a book to bill of 1 christopher j stephens yes and matt i would add that our backlog as we kind of ended q1 on industrial compared to the fourth quarter was flat it was in line which kind of complements the 1 1 book to bill ratio myles walton ubs analyst and then i think you ve said and i apologize if you already gave this number i think you ve said that within molding solutions the mold only side of the business saw a 20 plus organic growth in the quarter how much then was the automotive hot runner business down in q1 patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer it was down in the 20s matt summerville da davidson analyst okay so as we think about qs 2 3 and 4 and if we start off down 20 what is the reasonable sort of progression because i mean the whole key year to year basically sounds like it s in a nutshell synventive so in that regard i guess as we move through the rest of the year how do you expect those year over year comps to look patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer so relative to your comment is anchored in so far as that a heavy part of the molding solutions recovery throughout the year is dependent on automotive hot runners with continued strength projected within the mold side of the business and that as you stated was reflected in the performance of q1 the automotive hot runner side of the business is looking to sequentially improve over quarter to quarter throughout the year it s looking for improvement in q2 over q1 and so we re looking at that coming primarily from the asian markets as well as to a lesser degree north america and europe albeit that we re looking at improvement over where we feel we ve bottomed out in those 2 regions as well matt summerville da davidson analyst you mentioned i think it may have been in your prepared remarks that it sounded like march perhaps in china you started to see more quoting activity in auto which i believe would have pertained to the synventive business have those order or have those quotes excuse me started to translate into orders at this point or are we still waiting to see how that plays out in light of the ongoing sort of negotiations patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer no it s been a combination of both matt in that they ve seen orders and quoting translate into hard orders but also a number of them are still pending so it s a combination of both but clearly an uptake over what they experienced on the back end of 2018 and to the earlier part of the start of the year matt summerville da davidson analyst and just to stick with industrial i want to talk about the margins for a moment if you kind of look at either the sequential performance or year over year are you able to kind of bucket how much of the degradation was related to maybe mix if that was an issue versus the costs associated with restructuring which sounded like it was offset by this patent thing so if you could put numbers around that that ll be helpful and then how much was volume related is there a way to parse out kind of the margin downturn here christopher j stephens sure matt let me take a stab at that so on the let s just start with the volume because we did talk earlier that the volume reduction we saw in q1 in industrial and i ll talk quarter over quarter we can even talk sequentially is the higher margin businesses for us that saw a greater decline which clearly impacts that flow through in terms of our ability to get that volume leverage so that s quite significant and as a result those that lower production activity has put a strain in terms of our overhead cost structure but not getting the absorption and that s the reason for us to be proactive on the cost reduction side out of those 2 businesses and from a call it severance related charge little over 2 million but then the offset with that in the quarter was the favorable commercial settlement that we had that s noted in our press release and we made in our prepared remarks which was the 2 6 million so that s how we look at it it is a it is the fact that we re impacted by those higher margin businesses and now guiding instead at the mid teens in terms of margin out of industrials being in the low teens however to offset that and we ll just get back aerospace strength i mean we look at the outlook for the year to now being the low 20 range so we re shaving off 0 5 point from our overall bgi margin profile the upside to that could potentially be the automotive trade war if you will settles quicker than expected and we re all hoping and i think i m sure many companies are hoping for that to occur in the near term and we could see a nice bounce back we definitely expect there to be pent up demand decisions to be made and if they release we will see the benefit matt summerville da davidson analyst just with the production facing piece of industrial how do you think barnes fared versus the overall global production numbers that are out there for q1 maybe even talk about by region i guess i m trying to get a sense of how market share may be trending the magnitude of price pressure you may be seeing in that business et cetera patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer well organically if you think to what is our direct auto production facing businesses they are encased within engineered components and organic sales there were down 7 how that translates to global auto production was the numbers we looked at are north america global auto production was down around 3 europe 6 and china in the mid teens so for a total worldwide auto production decline in the high teens high single digits around 8 so with that we feel that our concentration is primarily in north america and europe more so than china in terms of direct auto production and so there we re pretty much in line i would say in terms of what we saw as a decline to auto production in general in those 2 regions matt summerville da davidson analyst thank you guys patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from josh chan with baird please go ahead your line is open josh chan baird analyst just 2 quick ones for me the first one just on industrial demand could you just kind of talk about like how it trended versus like what you were expecting where you saw demand weaker than you thought or maybe a little bit stronger patrick j dempsey president chief executive officer i would say on the industrial side what we saw was continued strength in terms of our molding solutions business on the mold side of the equation where we saw little weaker rebound was in our automotive hot runner side of molding solutions at the same time i think engineered components are the direct auto production was pretty much in line with expectations and tool and die markets i would suggest were pretty much in line with our expectations which was to see stabilizing throughout the quarter josh chan baird analyst okay yes that s helpful and then second one is on gimatic how is that business performing relative to your expectations i guess with the integration and also profitability versus what you were thinking operator great i m glad you brought it up so relative to the gimatic acquisition that has been progressing extremely well in terms of our integration efforts and what the teams have done and it s a great example of where we pulled together the resources from around the industrial business to quickly understand the capabilities of gimatic with a view to leveraging our existing relationships with the broad base of molding solutions customers that today have the potential to be gimatic customers and haven t been in the past so the in particular in germany and in china the 2 teams there are working extremely close together to look to leverage those existing relationships the other area that the team is very excited in terms of where they re focused on is continuing to develop new product lines in terms of new end of arm tooling technologies and so they re one of the most innovative and creative teams that we have in the organization and as we learn more about how they go about understanding their market understanding the voice of the customer and understanding where there s potential opportunities in a very entrepreneurial way the team there has done had done nothing but impressed us in terms of how they go about driving their business they have as i mentioned been impacted and so a little bit shy of expectations in the first quarter to where we expected the year to start primarily as a result of the fact that they do sell into the automotive industry as well and so the slow start in automotive they couldn t necessarily escape that and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to mr bill pitts for any closing remarks william pitts director of investor relations great thank you casey we would like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and we look forward to speaking with you next in july with our second quarter 2019 earnings call casey we will now conclude today s call operator thank you and ladies and

u s economy expands 3 2 percent in first quarter growth details weak by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s economic growth accelerated in the first quarter but the burst in growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015 temporary boosters that are seen weighing on the economy later this year the surge in growth reported by the commerce department on friday put to rest fears of a recession that were stoked by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve in march but it also exaggerates the health of the economy as consumer and business spending slowed sharply and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter gross domestic product increased at a 3 2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter the government said in its advance gdp report growth was also driven by increased investment in roads by local and state governments the gain in first quarter gdp would seem to make a mockery of claims that the u s economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto looking beyond the headline number however there are plenty of causes for concern the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the october december period economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp increasing at a 2 0 percent rate in the first three months of the year the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record president donald trump cheered the economy s performance in the first quarter this is far above expectations or projections trump tweeted the white house has sought to boost growth through an array of policies including a 1 5 trillion tax cut package passed in december 2017 economists believe the fiscal stimulus which also included more government spending peaked in the third quarter they expect gdp to slow this year with annual growth forecast around 2 5 percent below the trump s administration s 3 percent target the economy missed the growth target in 2018 excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at only a 1 3 percent rate in the first quarter the slowest since the second quarter of 2013 this measure of domestic demand increased at a 2 6 percent pace in the october december quarter a gauge of inflation tracked by the federal reserve increased at a 1 3 percent rate last quarter fed policymakers are likely to shrug off the last quarter s growth spurt and focus on the weak domestic demand and inflation when they meet next week the u s central bank recently suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign dropping forecasts for any interest rate increases this year the fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018 the fed will focus on the composition of growth which points to a slowing trend amid softening inflation said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm in new york this data reinforces the prudent pause the fed is engaged in the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies as investors fretted over the weak details of the gdp report u s treasury prices rose while stocks on wall street were mixed business spending stalls exports surged and imports declined in the first quarter leading to a small deficit that added 1 03 percentage points to gdp after being neutral in the fourth quarter trade tensions between the united states and china have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants the standoff has also had an impact on inventories which increased at a 128 4 billion rate in the first quarter the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015 inventories increased at a 96 8 billion pace in the october december quarter part of the inventory build was because of weak demand especially in the automotive sector which is expected to weigh on future production at factories inventories contributed 0 65 percentage point to first quarter gdp after adding one tenth of a percentage point in the october december period growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity slowed to a 1 2 percent rate from the fourth quarter s 2 5 percent rate the moderation in spending reflected a decline in motor vehicle purchases and other goods likely related to a 35 day shutdown of the federal government there was also a slowdown in spending on services the government said the shutdown had subtracted three tenths of a percentage point from gdp last quarter retail sales have since rebounded strongly pointing to some acceleration in consumption in the second quarter momentum in consumer spending picked up toward the end of the first quarter which augurs well for a better consumption outcome in the second quarter said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york even so we continue to expect gdp growth to step down to a 2 25 percent pace in second quarter business spending on equipment braked sharply rising at only at a 0 2 percent rate the slowest since the third quarter of 2016 spending was held down by weak outlays on agricultural machinery and office furniture investment in structures contracted for a third straight quarter residential construction fell at a 2 8 percent rate marking the fifth straight quarterly decline government investment rebounded at a 2 4 percent rate driven by spending at state and local governments federal government spending was flat reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao

and country served as a mediterranean playground for the likes of omar sharif and catherine deneuve it s an image many invoke when discussing the lebanese joie de vivre that heady mix of rueful stoicism and show must go on partying often advertised as the nation s antidote to successive calamities but to a growing chorus of experts aid officials and donors it s evidence of a debt fueled bender spelling economic doom and this time they say joie de vivre may not be enough advertisement this tiny nation slightly smaller than connecticut currently has the world s third highest ratio of public debt to its gross domestic product the debt now stands at more than 84 billion or roughly 152 of gdp last year s budget deficit alone reached 11 of gdp much of it for servicing the debt government employee salaries and subsidies for electricity power prices have gone unchanged since 1996 meanwhile eight years of unrest in neighboring syria and the region at large have battered economic growth this month the world bank revised its estimate for lebanon to 0 2 growth for this year down from 1 last year advertisement one lifeline is the 11 6 billion pledged last year at a donor conference in paris which brought together 50 countries and organizations including the u s france the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development to aid lebanon s decrepit infrastructure but the package which comprises 10 2 billion in loans and 860 million in grants came with tough talk from foreign officials they insisted on political and economic reforms including trimming wages for government workers and reducing the deficit by one percent a year above all they made clear the fractious lebanese government could no longer ignore its obligations the government does not have the luxury of time we must advance on several plans said france s ambassador to lebanon pierre duquesne at a news conference last month anything that can be done by the government over the coming weeks and months to confirm this will to move forward will be useful and even necessary advertisement so dire is the situation that even leaders of the nation s dysfunctional political class culled from 18 religious sects acknowledge the need for change last week lebanese prime minister saad hariri warned parliament that his government must prepare a budget that would be the most austere in the history of lebanon according to media reports if spending continued as it has the country could face economic disaster he added the statement followed similar warnings by lebanon s foreign minister gebran bassil that without a temporary reduction in wages for public servants there would be no salary left for anyone advertisement the announcements which spurred street protests followed parliament s approval of a far reaching plan to update a power grid that often leaves people in darkness meanwhile the 2019 draft budget due to be released in the coming days would target highly compensated state workers thousands of whom receive salaries higher than that of lebanon s president finance minister ali hasan khalil said in a recent interview with lebanese broadcaster mtv

supporters or receive kickbacks on projects advertisement step out of beirut s rafik hariri airport and you re likely to be greeted by heaps of trash the result of a years long garbage crisis that saw the opening of a landfill just beyond the runway attracting birds that could cause air disasters take a taxi and you ll join lebanese drivers who spend 50 more time than they should battling congested pothole strewn roads according to a recent government commissioned report by global consulting firm mckinsey co flip a light switch and it s likely nothing will happen only haiti nigeria and yemen

families who benefit from high interest rates transparency international s corruption perceptions index saw lebanon fall 10 places to 138th out of 180 countries between 2012 and 2018 advertisement meanwhile increasingly high prices a lack of opportunity and a decline in quality of life standards in the last few years have pushed a full third of the country s 1 2 million people of working age to seek their fortunes elsewhere said marwan iskander a lebanese economic expert all of our situation is mismanagement and taking advantage of one s authority iskandar said in an interview in beirut the politicians are uninterested in the welfare of the people and there are only a few who truly understand the economy in recent months washington has ramped up sanctions targeting iran and its allies including the lebanese shiite group and political faction hezbollah which the u s considers a terrorist organization but which has a strong base of popular support and controls several key ministries advertisement in recent weeks hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah launched a charity drive to replenish the group s funds in the face of what he called a financial war waged by the u s and iranian support to hezbollah which iskandar the economist estimated at some 1 5 billion has been cut dramatically visiting beirut last month u s secretary of state michael r pompeo excoriated officials for not standing up to hezbollah and he reportedly threatened to sanction the group s allies in the government which would include the president the foreign minister and the speaker of parliament officials here fear the sanctions could also threaten lebanon s crucial banking sector and dampen enthusiasm for the country s development of offshore gas fields advertisement meanwhile politicians have already begun positioning themselves as protectors of the poor and middle class talk shows that air on lebanese tv channels affiliated with the various parties now host acrimonious debates in

gabriel felbermayr head of germany s kiel institute for the world economy says the overseas lending boom is already fading the source from which china is financing its international investments is drying up he said total belt and road investments since 2013 amount to around us600 billion they peaked in 2017 and fell 40 per cent last year christmas tree of aspirations definition is treacherous the term has come to cover everything a christmas tree of aspirations extending to the arctic outer space cyberspace and even art exhibitions brand dilution has been endemic since president xi made the silk road his signature theme written into the communist party s constitution everybody has jumped on to the bandwagon xi vows to purify the project he told the belt and road forum in beijing this week that it must focus on quality growth that meets global standards we must adhere to the concept of openness greenness and cleanliness we must operate in the sun he said loading james lord from morgan stanley said china is becoming a net importer of capital as the country ages it will require net inflows rising to us400 billion a year by the end of the next decade beijing will have to compete for capital like everybody else hence this year s push by xi for more joint ventures with foreign banks and funds the official report recast the venture as an open inclusive initiative without political ideology it is not a china club it said this counters worldwide criticism that the belt and road is a cloak for strategic expansion as well as being a vehicle for debt diplomacy for the poorest countries but at the same time china needs the world s money china s overseas lending is almost entirely financed in us dollars and they are running short of those dollars said george magnus from the oxford university s china centre magnus said the drive to transform the yuan into a global funding currency is doomed in a context of tight capital controls and zero trade surpluses they have to tone down the hype and look for other countries to work with he said when you bring in outside money you lose control said jonathan hillman from the centre for strategic and international studies in washington hillman said the belt and road is an elastic term some fully signed up members such as korea have received almost nothing refuseniks such as india or germany get investment anyway misadventures japan s overseas investments are larger than those of china but are happening without fanfare the multilateral adb quietly lent us36 billion last year for development projects after the hubris comes scrutiny or moving from big freehand brushwork to fine brushwork in the elegant euphemism of the communist party the catalogue of misadventures is by now well known in europe montenegro s highway to nowhere wins the prize the ambitious link from the adriatic port of bar through mountains to the serbian hinterland was deemed unsustainable in two feasibility studies there is not enough potential traffic to recoup toll revenue the export import bank of china paid for a secret study that concluded otherwise work by china communications construction was launched the terms of the contract mean that any dispute must be settled in chinese courts in the case of default china can seize montenegrin land the imf says the unfinished project has pushed montenegro s debt ratio from 63 per cent to 80 per cent of gdp and is testing fiscal limits the fallout risks delaying eu accession since the country now breaches maastricht rules in the case of the hambantota port in sri lanka where the government signed away a 99 year lease after failing to repay chinese loans the interest rate on the debt was 6 3 per cent chinese money doesn t come cheap this is two to three times what the world bank of the adb charge there is a myth out there that chinese money comes cheap said hillman from csis lending practices are very opaque one of the best things the chinese can do at this point is to make the terms of the contracts public as all the multilateral development banks do he said perhaps the most bizarre feature of the belt and road is that it has become the lender of last resort for the construction of coal plants according to the institute for energy economics and financial analysis a coal fired power plant in shanxi province chinese lenders are funding us36 billion of coal projects across the world credit ap pushing coal the ieefa says chinese lenders chiefly state banks are funding us36 billion of coal projects across the world that will add 102 gigawatts of coal capacity only a third use best practice ultra supercritical technology this is happening at a time when the world bank multilateral bodies and most western lenders are pulling out of coal altogether a de minimis measure to avert runaway climate change chinese state entities are deeply involved in the construction and management of the plants these behemoths are finding a new lease of life abroad as coal curbs tighten at home the belt and road is an off ramp for china s own excess capacity problems it is often old technology and these plants will have a shelf life of 30 or even 50 years said hillsman they are concentrated in countries such as bangladesh vietnam and pakistan where solar or wind power are cost competitive and will become cheaper the debtors risk being stuck with stranded assets within a decade the ieefa says china s state entities are the chief villains private chinese companies are gravitating to renewable belt and road ventures since they are more profitable it takes active distortion to keep coal going beijing is also pushing its high co2 coal to chemical industry across developing asia
chinese president xi jinping is promising to set high standards for beijing s sweeping infrastructure building initiative amid concerns it leaves some developing countries with too much debt photo ap mr xi avoided mentioning debt in a speech at a belt and road forum in beijing celebrating his signature foreign initiative but he promised changes in response to complaints about costs and possible corruption and environmental damage beijing wants open green and clean cooperation with zero tolerance for corruption mr xi said developing countries have welcomed the initiative launched in 2013 to expand trade by building roads ports and other facilities from asia through africa and the middle east to europe but some governments are struggling to repay chinese loans fuelling complaints poor countries are being pushed into a debt trap the united states japan india and russia also chafe at the expansion of beijing s influence through building trade and political networks centred on china despite that russian president vladimir putin on friday praised the initiative saying it dovetails with the goals of a russian promoted market with four of its neighbours the eurasian economic union photo ap malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad who had suspended plans for a chinese built railway and other projects due to their cost said he was fully in support prime minister imran khan of pakistan one of china s closest allies said belt and road has produced substantial progress in increasing power supplies and other areas united nations secretary general antonio guterres said belt and road projects could help turn the balance in mitigating climate change xi s government is trying to revive the initiative s momentum after the number of new projects plunged last year that came after chinese officials said state owned banks would step up scrutiny of borrowers and some governments complained projects do too little for their economies and might give beijing too much political influence other countries including thailand and nepal have cancelled or scaled back projects while ethiopia and others have renegotiated debt repayment president xi promised changes to forestall corruption and environmental damage he tried to allay worries beijing reaps most of the economic benefits and is gaining political influence belt and road is not an exclusive club and promotes common development and prosperity mr xi said he said belt and road will embrace international standards for project development purchasing and operations china s ministry of finance issued debt sustainability guidelines for assessing debt risks to borrowers yesterday the ministry said they are based on standards of the international monetary fund and other international institutions the guidelines are intended to prevent and solve debt problems said finance minister liu kun they will classify countries as high middle and low risk based on productivity economic growth and other factors the standard may help reduce the financial stability risks faced by some borrowers but that will depend on how widely it is applied said moody s investors service in a statement mr xi said beijing wants to encourage cooperation on health water resources agriculture and technology he promised scholarships for students from belt and road countries chinese lenders have provided us440 billion nz660b in financing the country s central bank governor yi gang said without giving details on repayments or risks of defaults in addition some us75b has been raised in chinese bond markets according to mr yi the united states japan and other wealthy countries also finance construction in a region the asia development bank says needs 26 trillion of investment through to 2030 to keep economic growth strong in march italy became the first member of the group of seven major economies to sign an agreement to support belt and road belt and road countries also include many of the poorest and most indebted in africa and asia about one quarter of the 115 governments that have signed agreements to support the initiative have foreign debt equal to at least 75 percent of their annual economic output according to moody s mongolia is the most extreme at 240 percent egypt indonesia and pakistan all are above 50 percent none is in immediate danger of default but belt and road economies tend to have higher debt than average weaker financial flows and more vulnerability to economic shocks said lillian li a moody s vice president borrowing more external funds will be more dangerous to themselves as well as to the lending countries ms li said there s a limit to how much mr xi s government might change the initiative because beijing still wants to increase its influence and generate work for chinese industries tom rafferty of the economist intelligence unit said in a report ahead of the forum one element to watch will be whether beijing tries to enhance the appeal of belt and road by making it more like the world bank or other multinational organisations he said this has the potential to generate further tensions with the us mr rafferty said ap
carbon debt is simply the damage related cost of greenhouse gas ghg pollution that if not addressed now will inescapably have to be paid by future generations however ghg emissions continue to rise inexorably and there is no global program to draw down co2 and other ghgs from the atmosphere while young people are now vociferously demanding massive climate action inescapable global carbon debt is 200 250 trillion and increasing by 16 trillion each year unlike conventional debt that can be variously expunged by bankruptcy printing money or default carbon debt is inescapable thus for example national commitments to ghg pollution reduction made to the 2015 paris climate conference amount to a temperature rise of over 3 degrees centigrade 3c and unless huge sea walls are built netherlands style coastal cities of the world housing hundreds of millions of people will be submerged by rising sea levels notably in asia mega delta agricultural lands vital for feeding humanity will be subject

climate criminal lackey australia most governments around the world are politically committed to effective climate change denialism through climate change inaction that climate change inaction is most clearly quantitated in terms of carbon debt but the very term has been white washed out of public perception by us owned or subverted mainstream media thus the australian abc the taxpayer funded australian equivalent of the uk bbc is self assertedly progressive but a search of the abc for the term climate debt reveals zero 0 reportage a search of the self assertedly ethical uk bbc for the term climate debt yields 9 items with none later than 2009 defining the term or quantifying global or national carbon debt explanations for this extraordinary mainstream media lying by omission over carbon debt can be variously advanced ranging from entrenched mendacity by us and corporate subverted media to cognitive dissonance in the face of a worsening climate emergency however i am confident in predicting that if governments do not take action on the world s massive carbon debt then intergenerational justice action by the utterly betrayed and robbed young people of the world will make the present extinction rebellion climate demonstrations in london look like a proverbial teddy bear s picnic a young people led climate revolution non violent one hopes is coming but the horrendous numbers elicited in this analysis tell us that it is probably much too late set out below are various approaches to estimating the world s horrendous carbon debt and the numbingly gigantic annual increase in carbon debt in considering these huge numbers one must note that the global wealth was 317 trillion in 2018 an estimated 333 trillion in 2019 350 trillion in 2020 and 399 in 2023 the aggregate world wealth in the global carbon economy is increasing at about 14 trillion per year but the top 1 the one percenters who own half the wealth of the world have secured 82 of this wealth increase while the poorest 3 7 billion of the world have secured zero requisite atmospheric co2 draw down from the present 407 ppm co2 over the next decade will cost up to 12 7 to 24 9 trillion annually for various 342 to 280 ppm co2 goals professor james hansen of 96 nobel laureate columbia university one ppm of co2 is 2 12 billion tons of carbon or about 7 77 billion tons of co2 recently keith et al 2018 achieved a cost breakthrough in carbon capture demonstrated with a pilot plant in canada cost of carbon capture not including the cost of transportation and storage of the co2 is 113 232 per ton of co2 thus the cost of extracting 1 ppm of co2 from the atmosphere is 878 1803 billion in other words the cost in a single year of closing the gap between reality and the ipcc scenario that limits climate change to 1 5 c is already about 1 trillion and that is without the cost of transporting and storing the co2 or consideration of whether there will be citizen objection to that transportation and storage this annual cost will rise rapidly unless there is a rapid slowdown in carbon emissions cost of co2 storage has been estimated as 10 20 tco2 taking professor hansen s data and including his estimates of the cost of transport and storage of co2 indicates that this best so far cost of atmospheric co2 draw down is 123 252 tco2 accordingly the upper estimate of the cost of reducing the atmospheric co2 by 1 ppm 1 ppm x 7 77 gton co2 ppm x 252 ton co2 1 958 billion using this upper estimate one can calculate the cost of co2 draw down to various targets a james hansen has estimated a required co2 draw down to 342 ppm co2 if the earth s energy imbalance is 1 w m2 the upper estimate of the carbon debt for a transition from the present 407 ppm co2 to 342 ppm co2 is 65 ppm co2 x 1 958 billion per ppm co2 127 3 trillion or 12 7 trillion per year if we did this over 1 decade b the world s top coral scientists have collectively that world coral reefs started dying when the atmospheric co2 reached 320 ppm co2 and that a co2 draw down to this level is required for sustainability of the world s coral reefs the upper estimate of the carbon debt for a transition from the present 407 ppm co2 to 320 ppm co2 is 87 ppm co2 x 1 958 billion per ppm co2 170 3 trillion or 17 0 trillion per year if we did this over 1 decade c many scientists and science informed activists demand a reduction of atmospheric co2 to a safe and sustainable level of about 300 ppm co2 the upper estimate of the carbon debt for a transition from the present 407 ppmco2 to 300 ppm co2 is 107 ppm co2 x 1 958 billion per ppm co2 209 5 trillion or 21 0 trillion per year if we did this over 1 decade d professor hans joachim schellnhuber director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research germany 2008 perhaps it will not matter whether we have 270 ppm or 320 ppm but operating well outside the realm of carbon dioxide concentrations is risky as long as we have not fully understood the relevant feedback mechanisms the upper estimate of the carbon debt for a transition from the present 407 ppm co2 to 280 ppm co2 is 127 ppm co2 x 1 958 billion per ppm co2 248 7 0 trillion or 24 9 trillion per year if we did this over 1 decade upper estimate of 16 trillion for annual increase in carbon debt taking all greenhouse gases ghgs into account unfortunately there is presently no significant global effort to draw down atmospheric co2 and indeed global greenhouse gas ghg pollution is remorselessly increasing and with it a relentlessly increasing carbon debt as set out below in the last year the atmospheric co2 as measured by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa at mauna loa hawaii rose by 2 6 ppm co2 the upper estimate of the annual increase in carbon debt associated with this annual increase in co2 is 2 6 ppm co2 per year x 1 958 billion per ppm co2 5 1 trillion however there are ghgs other than co2 that contribute to global warming notably methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o ch4 derives from anaerobic bacterial metabolism in the rumens of ruminant livestock it is voided by eructation or belching and in anaerobic swamps or urban tips n2o derives from oxidation of nitrogenous agricultural fertilizers and also derives from nitrogen n2 oxidation associated with high temperature fossil fuel coal gas and oil combustion the global warming potential gwp of ch4 relative to the same mass of co2 on a 20 year time frame and with aerosol effects considered is 105 times that of co2 1 but is 21 on a 100 year time frame the gwp of n2o on a 20 year time frame relative to the same mass of co2 is 289 the combined global warming potential of atmospheric ghgs is expressed as co2 equivalent co2 e thus while the atmospheric co2 is presently 407 ppm the combined ghgs amount to 527 ppm co2 e according to professor ronald prinn professor of atmospheric science in the 93 nobel laureate massachusetts institute of technology mit department of earth atmospheric and planetary sciences when the co2 was 400 ppm in 2013 the co2 e was 478 ppm this suggesting a 2019 level of 486 co2 e world bank analysts have re assessed the annual global ghg emissions taking livestock land use and a 20 year time frame gwp of methane of 72 into account this analysis revised the annual ghg pollution upwards from 41 8 gt co2 e to 63 8 gt co2 e assuming that ch4 and n2o can be removed from the atmosphere for the same cost as removal of co2 then the resultant upper estimated cost of 252 per ton co2 e see section 1 above translates to an annual increase in carbon debt of 63 8 gt co2 e per year x 252 per ton co2 e 16 1 trillion per year this upper estimate of the annual cost of 16 1 trillion per year for ghg pollution is similar to the present annual wealth generation of 14 trillion per year indeed this equivalence should not be surprising in our presently carbon pollution based economy productivity can be measured either in the net dollar worth of production or in ghgs produced in the process one notes that the world s annual gdp nominal is about 85 trillion using the damage related cost of carbon pollution of 200 per tonne co2 yields a 11 6 trillion annual increase in carbon debt dr chris hope judge business school university of cambridge has estimated the damage related cost of carbon pollution 2011 if the best current scientific and economic evidence is to be believed and climate change could be a real and serious problem the appropriate response is to institute today a climate change tax equal to the mean estimate of the damage caused by a tonne of co2 emissions the raw calculations from the default page09 model suggest the tax should be about 100 per tonne of co2 in the eu but correcting for the limited time horizon of the model and bringing the calculations forward to 2102 in year 2012 dollars brings the suggested tax up to about 150 per tonne of co2 there are good arguments for setting the initial tax at about 250 per tonne of co2 in the us while starting off at a much lower level may be 15 per tonne of co2 in the poorest regions of the world all in the year 2012 in year 2012 dollars if we use the 200 per tonne co2 average of the damage related 250 per tonne co2 us and 150 per tonne co2 eu we can determine the annual increase in carbon debt as 63 8 billion ton co2 e per year x 200 per tonne co2 e x 0 907 tonne ton 11 6 trillion per year similar to the upper estimate of 16 trillion estimated in section 2 above based on the cost of removing ghgs from the atmosphere 4 the 16 trillion annual carbon debt increase value of a statistical life vsl and the 13 5 trillion annual cost of the global avoidable mortality holocaust of 15 million deaths from deprivation annually there is a largely ignored global avoidable mortality holocaust in which currently 15 million people die avoidably each year from deprivation and deprivation exacerbated disease in the developing world minus china avoidable mortality from deprivation avoidable deaths excess mortality excess deaths premature deaths untimely deaths deaths that should not have happened can be simply estimated from un population division demographic data as the difference between the actual deaths in a country and deaths expected for a peaceful decently run country with the same demographics for impoverished high birth rate developing countries the baseline mortality rate is about 4 deaths per 1 000 of population per year for such impoverished countries the avoidable mortality is about 1 4 times the under 5 infant deaths the latter information being readily obtained from the un population division this carnage is happening on spaceship earth with the flight deck under the control of the 10 richest people who have about 90 of the wealth of the world and who in turn are controlled by one percenters who own about 50 of the wealth of the world an annual global wealth tax of about 4 would yield 16 trillion annually as assessed in 2014 and enable raising all countries to an annual per capita gdp equivalent to the presently circa 8 500 per person per year of china and cuba countries for which annual avoidable mortality is zero 0 this is a feasible option for stopping the global avoidable mortality holocaust indeed a progressive annual wealth tax ranging up to 10 for the richest has been proposed for democracy and economic sustainability reasons by french economist professor thomas piketty in his important book capital in the twenty first century indeed islam has mandated a 2 5 annual wealth tax zakkat for about 1 400 years for americans the risk avoidance based value of a statistical life vsl is about 9 million and for people in the south with gdp per capitas of the order of 10 times lower than for the north we could roughly estimate a 10 times lower vsl of 0 9 million accordingly committing to a 4 annual wealth tax realizing 16 trillion in 2014 to save 15 million lives annually would be balanced by vsl based savings of 15 million people per year x 0 9 million per person 13 5 trillion per year the profligate 16 trillion annual increase in carbon debt see section 2 is numerically the same as the 4 annual wealth tax realizing 16 trillion in 2014 that could abolish the global avoidable mortality holocaust in which currently 15 million people die avoidably each year from deprivation at a vsl based cost of 13 5 trillion per year the top 10 countries in terms of their percentages of total global personal wealth as determined by allianz are as follows 1 united states 41 6 2 china 10 5 3 japan 8 9 4 u k 5 6 5 germany 3 9 6 france 3 5 7 canada 3 0 8 italy 2 9 9 australia 2 0 and 10 south korea 1 6 the rest account for 16 5 of the world s wealth the total accumulated wealth of the world in 2019 is 333 trillion and the average wealth of americans in 2018 was 63 100 this being similar to the gdp nominal per capita for americans of 60 000 a global 4 annual wealth tax would presently garner 13 3 trillion per year similar to the 15 7 trillion per year for a decade to get back to the coral reef based canary in the mine required 320 ppm co2 see section 1 however democratic presidential candidate senator elizabeth warren s recent radical wealth tax proposal a 2 annual tax on household net worth on all dollars above 50 million and an additional 1 surtax for those with above 1 billion in income would only garner an utterly paltry 0 275 trillion each year over 10 years from an america with 4 3 of the world s population 41 6 of the world s wealth 14 75 of world ghg pollution minus land use of 45 367 gt co2 e in 2014 i e 6 67 gt co2 e and corresponding to an annual carbon debt minus land use of at least 1 7 trillion per year of course one must recognize that her ignorant opponent donald trump dismissed climate change as a hoax in the 2016 presidential campaign the total carbon debt of the world is a daunting circa 200 250 trillion the upper estimate of the carbon debt for a transition from the present 407 ppm co2 back to the pre industrial revolution level of 280 ppm co2 is 127 ppm co2 x 1 958 billion per ppm co2 248 7 0 trillion a sum that is 78 of the 2018 accumulated wealth of the world of 317 trillion in 2018 and if paid off over 1 decade would require payment at 24 9 trillion per year alternatively the historical carbon debt of a country can be measured by the amount of greenhouse gas ghg it has introduced into the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution in the mid 18th century thus the total carbon debt of the world in giga tonnes co2 e i e billions of tonnes co2 e from 1751 2019 including co2 that has gone into the oceans is about 346 gt co2 e 1750 2008 638 gt co2 e 2009 2019 984 gt co2 e assuming a damage related carbon price of 200 per tonne co2 equivalent this corresponds to a carbon debt of 197 trillion about two thirds of the total wealth of the world 317 trillion in 2018 and 2 3 times the world s total annual gdp 85 trillion in 2018 payment of this debt over 1 decade would require payment at 19 7 trillion per year 6 total and annual carbon debt of the us australia china and india the us has a huge ghg pollution of 5 14 gtonnes co2 e per year and of about 51 4 gtonnes co2 e for the period 2009 2019 with an historical ghg pollution of 99 1 gtonnes co2 e 1750 2008 for a total carbon debt of 51 4 99 1 150 5 gtonnes co2 e that corresponds at 200 per tonne co2 e to a carbon debt of 30 1 trillion that is increasing at 1 0 trillion per year 6 3 of the world s 16 trillion per year however a revised estimate of us ghg pollution taking land use and ch4 into account is 41 tonnes co2 e per person per year for the us or 19 6 gt based on a present population of 327 million and hence an annual carbon debt increase of 2 0 trillion per year 12 5 of the world s 16 trillion per year increase in carbon debt this revised estimate is more consistent with the us population 327 million 4 3 of that of the world being responsible for 24 1 of the world s gdp in a global carbon economy world population 7 530 billion my own country australia that is among world leaders in 14 ghg pollution related areas has a carbon debt of us 5 1 trillion a 7 trillion that is increasing at us 400 billion a 556 billion per year and at us 40 000 a 56 000 per head per year for under 30 year old australians however a revised estimate of australian annual ghg pollution taking land use and ch4 into account is 52 9 tonnes co2 e per person per year or based on a population of 25 million 1 32 gt co2 e and an annual increase in carbon debt of 0 26 trillion per year 1 7 of the world s 16 trillion per year carbon debt increase taking australia s huge coal and gas exports into account australia s annual ghg pollution is 116 tonnes co2 e per person per year or with a population of 25 million 2 9 gt co2 e and an annual carbon debt increase of 0 6 trillion 3 8 of the world s 16 trillion per year increase in carbon debt noting that australia s population is only 0 3 of the world s population and contributes 1 4 of world gdp the revised annual ghg emission of china population 1 390 million taking land use and ch4 into account is 7 4 tonnes co2 e per person per year 2013 and 10 3 gt co2 e in total per year with this corresponding to an annual increase in carbon debt of 2 1 trillion per year 13 1 of the world s annual carbon debt increase noting that china has 18 5 of the world s population and contributes 12 2 of world gdp india does even better than china on a per capita basis the revised annual ghg emission of india population 1 340 million taking land use and ch4 into account is 2 1 t co2 e per person per year 2013 and 2 8 gt co2 e in total per year with this corresponding to an annual increase in carbon debt of 0 56 trillion per year 3 5 of the world s annual carbon debt increase noting that india has 17 8 of the world s population and contributes 2 6 of world gdp from the above it is apparent that on a per capita basis the us and australia contribute disproportionately and vastly more to the annual increase in global carbon debt than china that contributes its fair share and india that contributes much less to the human world s suicide mission vsl and the 7 trillion annual cost of 7 million annual deaths from carbon based air pollution and 1 million annual deaths from climate change about 7 million people die each year from the effects of pollutants from carbon fuel burning it has been estimated that 0 4 million people die each year from climate change but this is surely an underestimate because each year 15 million people die avoidably from deprivation in the impoverished tropical and sub tropical south that is disproportionately impacted by climate change accordingly one can reasonably posit that annual climate change deaths are of the order of 1 million adopting a risk avoidance based value of a statistical life vsl of 0 9 million per person for impoverished countries one can see that 8 million annual deaths from carbon fuel burning and climate change correspond to 8 million deaths x 0 9 million per person 7 2 trillion unfortunately the climate genocide that presently kills about 1 million people per year is worsening several leading climate scientists have estimated that as few as 0 5 billion people will survive this century if man made climate change is not requisitely addressed with this translating to about 10 billion climate deaths this century and an extremely academic carbon debt of 9 000 trillion 200 per tonne co2 e carbon tax can help drive rapid transit to zero emissions and thence massive negative emissions if we accept that all men are created equal then it is a no brainer that polluters should fully pay for the social and environmental cost of their pollution indeed pope francis has unequivocally stated that the social and environmental cost of pollution should be fully borne by the polluters in stark contrast to the terracidal one percenters pope francis recognizes a looming climate catastrophe and millions of premature deaths from carbon burning pollutants demands massive decarbonisation and conversion to renewables starting without delay in the next few years rejects carbon trading as a dishonest ploy advocates a fully borne carbon price carbon tax on polluters proposes boycotts of polluters condemns loss of biodiversity and advises intergenerational solidarity two expert estimates of a required carbon tax carbon price are considered above to whit 200 per tonne co2 e from climate economist dr chris hope of 118 nobel laureate cambridge university and up to 252 per ton co2 e 229 per tonne co2 e from professor james hansen of 96 nobel laureate columbia university nevertheless the politically dominant climate criminal one percenters who control half the wealth of the world have responded to such expert opinion with massively funded climate change denialism and thence variously with fall back positions of grossly insufficient corrupt and counterproductive carbon trading schemes to preserve the present suicidal carbon economy a 200 per tonne co2 e carbon tax can help drive rapid transit to zero emissions and thence massive required negative carbon emissions as set out above 8 any species is priceless anthropocene era mass extinctions imply infinite carbon debt we must not destroy what we cannot replace any species is accordingly priceless yet mass extinctions are now occurring at such a level to have prompted scientists to call the present era the anthropocene era the extinction rates are now 100 1 000 above normal thus for example coral reefs are hugely complex multi species ecosystems and the ipcc has recently projected a further 70 90 decline of coral reefs at global warming of 1 5c versus more than a 99 loss at 2c anthropocene era mass extinctions imply infinite carbon debt that said environmental economists have assessed the economic value of nature as of the same order as the annual world gdp dr andrew balmford and colleagues have stated 2002 on the eve of the world summit on sustainable development it is timely to assess progress over the 10 years since its predecessor in rio de janeiro loss and degradation of remaining natural habitats has continued largely unabated however evidence has been accumulating that such systems generate marked economic benefits which the available data suggest exceed those obtained from continued habitat conversion we estimate that the overall benefit cost ratio of an effective global program for the conservation of remaining wild nature is at least 100 1 9 impossibly high carbon debt from unlimited australian coal and gas exports 353 trillion and adumbrated arctic ch4 release 1 050 trillion climate criminal australia 0 3 of the world s population has a bipartisan policy fervently adhered to by the present liberal party national party coalition government and the labor party opposition that are collectively known as the lib labs of unlimited coal gas an iron exports in contrast the science informed australian greens want to achieve 100 renewable energy and cease all thermal coal exports by 2030 however it is estimated that feasible exploitation of australia s presently discovered conventional and unconventional gas resources would generate 61 5 billion tonnes of co2 e and combustion of australia s huge coal resource potential of 1 trillion tonnes of coal would be an estimated 692 7 gt co2 from brown coal plus 1 073 9 gt co2 from black coal for a total of 1 766 6 gt co2 with this corresponding to a carbon debt of 1 7666 trillion tonnes co2 x 200 per tonne co2 353 trillion similar to the accumulated global wealth of 350 trillion in 2020 australia has always been a deeply racist country but this takes racism and exceptionalism to an extraordinary genocidal and indeed terracidal level it gets worse professor peter wadhams professor of ocean physics and head of the polar ocean physics group in the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics 118 nobel laureate university of cambridge uk and colleagues on the threat of a 50gt methane release from the east siberian arctic shelf 2013 economic time bomb as the amount of arctic sea ice declines at an unprecedented rate the thawing of offshore permafrost releases methane a 50 gigatonne gt reservoir of methane stored in the form of hydrates exists on the east siberian arctic shelf it is likely to be emitted as the seabed warms either steadily over 50 years or suddenly the global warming potential gwp of ch4 on a 20 year time frame and with aerosol impacts included is 105 relative to co2 1 and this 50 gt ch4 release corresponds to 50 gt ch4 x 105 t co2 e t ch4 5 250 gt co2 e which in turn corresponds to a carbon debt at 200 per tonne co2 e of 1 050 trillion or 3 times greater than the accumulated wealth of whole world final comments the world already has an inescapable carbon debt of 200 250 trillion that instead of being urgently reduced by massive atmospheric co2 draw down is relentlessly increasing at about 16 trillion per year in a domestic household

views of cointelegraph com advertisement advertisement sixteen months after from a peak value of 19 100 bitcoin is now hovering around 5 000 despite its wide distance from the historical maximum today s price is good news for the market as the recent rise could be the end of the collapse produced by the violent explosion of the digital currency bubble in 2018 from december 2017 the price of every digital asset has fallen on average 80 for bitcoin it has been the second collapse ever recorded a violent fall even for an unconventional asset that has historically shown very marked boom and bust cycles in 2011 the price declined by 93 to 2 from a maximum of 39 while in 2013 in just a few weeks the price exploded to 1 151 to decline later to 177 over a 12 month period it is not certain that this time the bottom has been touched despite the encouraging developments of the last weeks historically the phase of rapid decline is followed by a stagnation of the price that can even last years named in jargon as a crypto winter in the context of a widespread speculative bubble that the so called altcoins have turned out to be apart from any technical evaluation simple variants more volatile and less liquid than bitcoin almost perfectly correlated with each other this feature made any attempt to diversify the risk between different crypto assets futile btc and eth price behavior 1 year rolling correlation among altcoins a specific mention should go to ethereum this is the digital currency classified as second in terms of capitalization that has been exploited as a technical platform for the proliferation of the initial coin offerings icos these icos have been exploited to cover real public purchase offers by collecting financial resources sheltered from regulators and by financing dubiously weak or shady projects most of these initiatives have invariably destroyed economic resources or turned out to be real scams in which investors defensive capabilities were substantially nullified advertisement advertisement ex post the price pattern during the bitcoin bubble closely followed the asymmetric behavior of its historical cousins starting with the tulipan bubble of 1637 passing through that of the south sea company up to the most recent burst of the dot com bubble of 1999 2000 after a phase of moderate rise a very rapid manic phase of vertical price growth of about nine months followed with a final buying hysteria in december 2017 the month in which the price more than doubled starting from an already very high base the summit was touched with a classic double peak in january 2018 synchronized not surprisingly with the achievement of the maxima on global stock markets and with the peak of liquidity released into the global economy by the main central banks since then the price of bitcoin has had an almost uninterrupted decline with very rapid collapses and shorter and less convincing recoveries with descending relative maxima story continues what is the floor of this incredible descent on the subject we must consider that bitcoin its clones and the rest of the digital currencies do not have their own intrinsic value prices are simply determined by the intersection of demand and supply on individual exchange markets these are often highly illiquid prices differing from each other by hundreds of euros without effective arbitrage between the various markets due to the structural limits of bitcoin and settlement platforms therefore it is very difficult to think of determining what the fair value could be often for traders operating on these markets the technical analysis is the only tool for interpreting price movements this paradoxically means that the price dynamic determined by the collective actions of the traders sometimes follows the forecasting patterns of the technical analysis under this overall picture it is worth trying to isolate the main drivers of the rise and fall of bitcoin and other altcoins the role played by the stablecoin tether has been predominant in the phase of the rapid price increase between march and december 2017 advertisement advertisement a stablecoin is a digital currency anchored with a fixed exchange rate to a fiat currency traded on the forex market such as the dollar or the euro its existence is justified by the fact that at present the conversion between fiat and digital currencies is still slow and cumbersome given that it requires a funds transfer from traditional banks to crypto exchanges via cross border banks payment systems whose settlement may require several days the conversion between digital currencies is instead instantaneous and allows traders to protect themselves by using stablecoins from the very high volatility of bitcoin s and altcoins prices of course 1 tether is not equivalent to 1 because it cannot be freely converted although the company itself has always declared to hold a reserve of dollars corresponding to the quantity of tether issued and circulating on the exchanges however for traders tether performs the same function of the dollar so it is irrelevant whether there is or is not full or partial convertibility in april 2019 there are at least eight different stablecoins on the market offering the same tether service but in 2017 tether substantially managed a monopoly that heavily influenced the price trend on the various exchanges as evidenced by a statistical analysis made by the university of austin texas what s happened has a lot to do with the fact that the company that issued tether was de facto controlled by the largest crypto exchange in asia bitfinex btc price and techer capitallization rolling correlation btc price usdr capitalization by examining the data see figures above we can observe how the price behavior of bitcoin and of the other altcoins in the pump phase of the bubble is perfectly correlated with the issuing of new tether on the exchanges as the aforementioned research shows it is statistically probable that the bitfinex exchange has artificially fueled the manic buying of digital currencies through the issuing of increasing amounts of tether in a phase of exponential price rise the issuing of tether without adequate coverage in dollars is a profitable strategy in fact speculators could buy digital currencies with newly minted tether counting on being able to resell them at a higher price later and replenish the dollar reserves the signal of strong price increases in increasingly accelerated times contributed to the growth of the media hype on digital currencies which attracted retail investors with little experience in digital assets often unaware of the enormous risks related to the terminal phase of a speculative bubble advertisement advertisement the long price contraction perhaps not yet completed despite the recent recovery in prices was caused by two main factors operating in two distinct time phases between january and april 2018 the decline was demand driven and therefore determined by the flight of frightened speculative investors highly exposed to losses due to the purchases made at very high prices in this classic panic selling it can be noted that the support of a growing issue of tether was also lacking on the exchanges in fact since february the growth of tether in circulation has slowed down and flattened out this is indicative of the fact that in a declining market the strategy of issuing uncovered tether was no longer profitable in june 2018 the price apparently found a floor at around 6 000 a level still over 10 times greater than the price that bitcoin had at the beginning of 2017 at this point the majority of speculative investors has already disappeared and the volatility of digital currencies was drastically reduced as trades gradually became thinner see figure below many analysts believed that at this stage 6 000 was the minimum level necessary to offset the energy costs of the miners that were digitally coining the new crypto assets until then the need of a widening population of miners to catch cover rising production costs was a force that supported the price growth of digital assets 1 year rolling annualized volatility of some digital assets however this fragile balance did not hold in november 2018 the announcement of another hard fork between digital currencies that aimed to coin a new bitcoin clone without substantial innovations caused a price earthquake that broke the fragile equilibrium achieved in this deteriorating framework the determining factor of the price decline seemed to be offer driven and related to the digital currencies mining community in fact a substantial share of miners abruptly shifted its computing power or hash rate from bitcoin toward clone currencies in the hope to reap risk free profits from the blockchain fork as already happened several times in the ascending phase of the bubble advertisement advertisement but at the end of 2018 things were changing the anomalous shift in computing power took away support for bitcoin and dragged the price of digital assets in a downward spiral including the clone currencies on which the miners had heavily invested as a consequence a part of the miners which was already operating at a loss before this downturn has been thrown out of the market causing for the first time ever a decline of the overall computing power of the bitcoin network which collapsed by 50 in just a few weeks see figure below in this short period of time bitcoin and the altcoins went in a free fall never experienced in the demand driven phase of the bursting of the bubble suffering losses in the order of 70 bitcoin mining computational power in 2019 the darwinian selection of miners seems to have stopped as testified by the recovery of the overall network hash rate albeit at a more moderate rate the bitcoin protocol provides an automatic mechanism of autoregulation such that the cost of currency s mining tends to fall in the face of a decline in the network computing power this periodic adjustment allows marginal operators to return to the market at lower costs in the early months of the year cryptocurrencies slowly regained value but the real surprise came on april 2 when in just one hour bitcoin spiked by almost 1 000 surpassing 5 000 a new resistance that has basically held up over the weeks since advertisement advertisement it is not clear what the reason for this jump was perhaps an algorithmically generated order or a liquidity squeeze connected to bitcoin derivatives followed by a forced buy in on market makers quotes after all recently various analysts had forecast a surge in the short term and knowing the trigger event matters little the real question is whether the market is heading back into bull mode multiple factors support an affirmative answer the gradual recovery of the market capitalization of some stablecoins tether first see figure below the wear of the resources available to the bears the albeit moderate return of various central banks to an accommodating monetary policy and the uncertainty linked to relevant phenomena on a global scale the libyan crisis trade tensions the brexit conundrum and forthcoming european union elections that increases the appeal of digital currencies bitcoin price versus tether capitalization 2019 could prove to be a new starting point for digital currencies given the slow recovery of investors interest investments in technological innovation and infrastructure have never stopped and the interests of institutional investors go beyond the short term speculative frenzy regulators are also gradually intervening in the reorganization of these frontier markets the crypto winter may be less long than

the world has seen a gradual rise in populist movements our own president muhammadu buhari s second term victory could be attributed to the unquestioning support of low income earning citizens not necessarily because they re convinced he can help the status quo but for the mere fact that they can better identify with him president trump s ascent to power was on the promise of reviving the economy for the middle class making america great again the yellow vest movement in france the nationalist parties in germany and the brexit brouhaha all have a major connection to the relative economic shift happening in our world huge economically disenfranchised populations are feeling the pinch and are fighting back the summary is that capitalism as presently constituted is losing its appeal in an april interview with marketwatch com richard trumka the president of the largest labour union in america the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organizations afl cio noted that capitalism has failed to boost wages for the lower and middle class and is in danger of getting replaced he cited trump s emergence as proof of this shift his assertions hold water for the past 40 years according to data from the pew research centre adjusting for inflation wages for non supervisor roles in the usa have not risen by more than 10 in nigeria it has actually regressed if we use the minimum wage for example in dollar terms n30 000 84usd in 2019 is a lot less than n18 000 118usd in 2010 note however that within the same period globally the prices of assets like land housing and automobile have seen major growth this is so much so that in most european cities even surgeons who represent the typical well paid middle class can hardly afford a home close to the city centre the scenario is same in nigeria advertisement in addition to this gradual pauperization of the low and middle class is the increase in national debt profile according to pencom september 2018 the nigerian federal government has borrowed more than 70 of the contributed pensions and though nigeria is yet to default on her debt obligations with more than 60 of the federal government revenue going towards debt servicing we are not too far from that destination with a debt to gdp ratio of 23 4 nigeria is pretty better than usa 82 3 china 47 8 and india 70 2 considering the size of the gdp of these nations these are gigantic debts and since domestic debts account for a bulk of these debts the working middle class are hardest hit when governments print more money to pay this debt or fund the now ubiquitous welfare programmes causing inflation in other words it is the middle class that lends its pensions to governments that suffer the most when governments print money to repay them it is no surprise then that the middle class is shrinking few working class millennials can afford what their working parents achieved at the same age this is not just a nigerian challenge it is a global challenge and is contributing to a lot of global conflicts including the xenophobia in south africa xenophobia and similar militant nationalism are quite appealing it is easier to blame someone else particularly foreigners for intractable issues like these brexit is a classic case study advertisement beggar thy neighbor locally and internationally capitalism is driven by corporations and corporations exist solely to maximize shareholders wealth though capitalism has done much better in supporting a free and prosperous society than socialism and communism the challenge of unequal income distribution is becoming a significant concern with it comes a growing tolerance for socialism many people are beginning to wonder if karl marx was not right after all we now expect governments to solve most of our economic problems and it appears we must make a choice between the freedom that comes from capitalism and the equality socialism communism offers the challenge is that it is unlikely that we can have both even though we can argue that capitalists do not seek to beggar their neighbours yet it is not the stated goal of the capitalist structure to drive the development of her neighbours rather it is to harness the best of available resources to achieve optimal profitability hence developing countries which are less competitive generally have a hard time getting good deals even the usa is now aggressively renegotiating her trade deals this survival of the shrewdest scenario is the reason nigeria will need a lot more than aid money to develop we are far from competitive in a frantically competing world in fact the word competitiveness is just making a renaissance with our political elite considerations advertisement the goal of this article is to offer an alternative perspective particularly for developing countries in africa which are not yet completely enmeshed in the capitalist culture and are also at a loss as to which forms of governance to adopt considering the challenges of the available alternatives it is premised on the conclusion that the current state is not sustainable the basis of the recommendations is underpinned by the following key factors socio economic impacts can and should be measured regardless of the agent i e either the public or private sector sustainability of national development interventions is hinged on the level of balance within the system quality of human and material development equal opportunity in income distribution etc the pricing of inputs and outputs provides indicators on the level of efficiency level of balance in income distribution and long term system sustainability culture and education are key factors that influence capacity for long term productivity sustainability indices sustainability indices sis as envisioned here are guidelines regulations laws prescribed by government in collaboration with the private sector that stipulate expected desired and required ranges of input and output conditions for broad sectors of the economy for example what is the required ratio of house pricing as a proportion of median income corporate profit allocation between workers and shareholders the price of basic education as a ratio of long term individual productivity the price of basic health care as a proportion of median income and the best pricing system for public bonds the key goal of the sis is to ensure that the activities of both the private sector reflect foster and achieve sustainability considerations this is very important as capitalism as presently construed does not consider sustainability as a target advertisement take for example the cost of housing one of man s most important expenditure items when the cost of housing exceeds a certain proportion of household income it becomes non sustainable the same applies to cost of basic household feeding health and education proactive collaboration between the state and private sector to achieve outcomes that meet the sustainable indices are critical for sustainable development the sis therefore provide a goal post for economic activities regardless of whether they are capitalistic or social in nature the goal of government consequently will be to engage critical stakeholders to meet those sustainable ranges and to be inactive when market forces alone can achieve the same advertisement for income distribution for example the sis can determine what is equitable either by using taxes or by regulating in house company profit sharing systems another major issue is public bonds issuance governments have fallen in the habit of issuing long term bonds they don t plan to repay in the foreseeable future however with an si system that ensures that all bonds are repayable from their impacts within say a 25 year interval it is expected that greater thought would be applied to government debt management systems note that the asset prices in some industries e g railways and road construction can be inflated based on the fact that governments are the main buyers in other words when evaluated for their economic output some of such assets are overpriced sis ensure that public borrowings for public infrastructure must reflect sustainability outputs should be sufficient to cover the cost of inputs after adjusting for other costs inflation and premiums advertisement the above if implemented will lead to structured independent government bonds and a departure from a typical socialist structure where government builds ultra cheap infrastructure in the short term with heavy loan obligations in the long term under this arrangement a road infrastructure bond will exist as a self repayable bond for example government can structure itself to focus this is an example 30 of its revenue on unrepayable investments security etc 25 on overhead 10 on savings 30 on repayable investments its investment and 5 on prospecting note that taxation is a form of repayment this proposal essentially recommends that the government be restructured as a social venture capitalist managing public resources with a focus on sustainability and not just growth advertisement key effects of this approach immediate dwindling of the cost of governance as many government institutions will fail to meet the requisite sustainability conditions increased transparency in the governance process as the goal posts are real and easy to comprehend massive investment in long term impactful education as this portends one of the most sustainable interventions decrease in government debt resulting from more pragmatism in project design and implementation reduced income disparity due to relatively reduced asset appreciation and better income distribution practice emergence of balanced incentive structures

gabriel felbermayr head of germany s kiel institute for the world economy says the overseas lending boom is already fading the source from which china is financing its international investments is drying up he said total belt and road investments since 2013 amount to around us600 billion they peaked in 2017 and fell 40 per cent last year christmas tree of aspirations definition is treacherous the term has come to cover everything a christmas tree of aspirations extending to the arctic outer space cyberspace and even art exhibitions brand dilution has been endemic since president xi made the silk road his signature theme written into the communist party s constitution everybody has jumped on to the bandwagon xi vows to purify the project he told the belt and road forum in beijing this week that it must focus on quality growth that meets global standards we must adhere to the concept of openness greenness and cleanliness we must operate in the sun he said loading james lord from morgan stanley said china is becoming a net importer of capital as the country ages it will require net inflows rising to us400 billion a year by the end of the next decade beijing will have to compete for capital like everybody else hence this year s push by xi for more joint ventures with foreign banks and funds the official report recast the venture as an open inclusive initiative without political ideology it is not a china club it said this counters worldwide criticism that the belt and road is a cloak for strategic expansion as well as being a vehicle for debt diplomacy for the poorest countries but at the same time china needs the world s money china s overseas lending is almost entirely financed in us dollars and they are running short of those dollars said george magnus from the oxford university s china centre magnus said the drive to transform the yuan into a global funding currency is doomed in a context of tight capital controls and zero trade surpluses they have to tone down the hype and look for other countries to work with he said when you bring in outside money you lose control said jonathan hillman from the centre for strategic and international studies in washington hillman said the belt and road is an elastic term some fully signed up members such as korea have received almost nothing refuseniks such as india or germany get investment anyway misadventures japan s overseas investments are larger than those of china but are happening without fanfare the multilateral adb quietly lent us36 billion last year for development projects after the hubris comes scrutiny or moving from big freehand brushwork to fine brushwork in the elegant euphemism of the communist party the catalogue of misadventures is by now well known in europe montenegro s highway to nowhere wins the prize the ambitious link from the adriatic port of bar through mountains to the serbian hinterland was deemed unsustainable in two feasibility studies there is not enough potential traffic to recoup toll revenue the export import bank of china paid for a secret study that concluded otherwise work by china communications construction was launched the terms of the contract mean that any dispute must be settled in chinese courts in the case of default china can seize montenegrin land the imf says the unfinished project has pushed montenegro s debt ratio from 63 per cent to 80 per cent of gdp and is testing fiscal limits the fallout risks delaying eu accession since the country now breaches maastricht rules in the case of the hambantota port in sri lanka where the government signed away a 99 year lease after failing to repay chinese loans the interest rate on the debt was 6 3 per cent chinese money doesn t come cheap this is two to three times what the world bank of the adb charge there is a myth out there that chinese money comes cheap said hillman from csis lending practices are very opaque one of the best things the chinese can do at this point is to make the terms of the contracts public as all the multilateral development banks do he said perhaps the most bizarre feature of the belt and road is that it has become the lender of last resort for the construction of coal plants according to the institute for energy economics and financial analysis a coal fired power plant in shanxi province chinese lenders are funding us36 billion of coal projects across the world credit ap pushing coal the ieefa says chinese lenders chiefly state banks are funding us36 billion of coal projects across the world that will add 102 gigawatts of coal capacity only a third use best practice ultra supercritical technology this is happening at a time when the world bank multilateral bodies and most western lenders are pulling out of coal altogether a de minimis measure to avert runaway climate change chinese state entities are deeply involved in the construction and management of the plants these behemoths are finding a new lease of life abroad as coal curbs tighten at home the belt and road is an off ramp for china s own excess capacity problems it is often old technology and these plants will have a shelf life of 30 or even 50 years said hillsman they are concentrated in countries such as bangladesh vietnam and pakistan where solar or wind power are cost competitive and will become cheaper the debtors risk being stuck with stranded assets within a decade the ieefa says china s state entities are the chief villains private chinese companies are gravitating to renewable belt and road ventures since they are more profitable it takes active distortion to keep coal going beijing is also pushing its high co2 coal to chemical industry across developing asia

integrated gas renewables power or igrp segment effective this year the lng business including the upstream and midstream operation is being reported as part of the igrp segment so we have provided restated past results and the current results reflect this new format also this year we have revised some of our indicators and we have of course implemented ifrs 16 the group s production hit a new high of more than 2 95 million barrels per day in the first quarter an increase of 9 year on year and 2 4 quarter on quarter in february presentation we highlight three start ups that would contribute 3 billion of cash flow in 2019 with brent at 60 per barrel and all three egina kaombo north and south and icthys have started and are ramping up now operationally upstream is on track and performing very well and our main priority is to fid new major projects like mero two in brazil and arctic lng two in russia to lock in low development costs and ensure profitable growth well into the next decade i would also like to point out that exploration has delivered some good news recently in our core north sea area we made the glengorm gas condensate recovery the largest in the area since 2008 on a block that was part of the maersk acquisition and in deep offshore south africa we made a significant play opening discovery with the brulpadda well for the redefined e p segment first quarter adjusted net operating income was 1 7 billion compared to 1 8 billion a year ago and 2 0 billion in the previous quarter brent averaged 63 per barrel in first quarter compared to 69 per barrel in the fourth quarter our average liquid pipes realization was stable quarter to quarter at 59 per barrel reflecting mainly the rebound in canadian differentials natural gas however was down about 10 from previous quarter to 4 5 per million btu mainly due to mild weather in the first quarter and i should point out that exploration expenses increased by about 100 million in the first quarter compared to previous quarter and the same quarter last year our confidence in the future has been reinforced by the strong cash flow delivered this quarter despite the lower brent and gas prices in the first quarter the redefined e p segment generated cash flow before working capital change of 4 2 billion a 9 increase compared to the previous quarter volume growth from cash accretive new projects more than offset the lower price moving to igrp this new segment spearheads our ambitions in fast growing integrated gas lng and low carbon electricity businesses overall lng sales were 7 7 million tonnes in the first quarter double compared to 3 8 million tonnes in the first quarter last year and stable compared to 7 9 million tonnes in the previous quarter igrp adjusted net operating income was 0 6 billion in the first quarter 2019 an increase of 23 year on year igrp generated 0 6 billion of cash flow before working capital changes in the first quarter a 50 increase compared to the first quarter last year reflecting mainly the 50 increase in our equity lng production quarter on quarter igrp cash flow before working capital changes was stable despite the sharp drop in nbp and lng spot prices total s portfolio of lng projects is unmatched in the industry yamal lng and icthys lng are ramping up and cameron lng train 1 is set to start in may we signed the definitive agreement for our entry into arctic lng 2 as well as the gas agreement with the state of papua new guinea to clear the way for papua lng in north america we are working with our partners to add two additional trains at cameron as well progressing the eca project in baja mexico and we further committed to invest in tellurian s driftwood lng project in addition we are actively pursuing the expansion of nigeria lng with an fid target by the end of this year by 2020 we expect our lng business to grow to 40 million tonnes a year or 10 of the global market and the new igrp segment provides us with a platform to effectively optimize profitability along the entire lng value chain the igrp segment is active in many growing markets in the first quarter we announced a 10 year lng supply agreement with guanghui energy in china that calls for 0 7 million tonnes a year that will source from our global portfolio on the marketing side we have merged total spring into direct energie and the combined entity is now trading as total direct energie we also announced that our saft battery unit is creating a joint venture with the chinese group tianneng to develop and manufacture advanced lithium ion cell for ev e bike and energy storage solutions or ess china is the largest and fastest growing market for ev and lithium ion batteries turning to downstream i think most of you already know this story well we are concentrating our new investment in growth areas mainly advantaged feedstock brownfield expansion of petrochemicals in r c and entries to the new fast growing larger market for m s these segments are important to total in terms of consistently generating high returns and providing a countercyclical source of free cash flow refining chemicals generated 0 8 billion of adjusted net operating income in the first quarter compared to 0 7 billion a year ago and 0 9 billion in the previous quarter in part due to margin volatility for refining we changed reference indicator to the average margin on variable cost achieved by our own european refineries and this was 33 per tonne in the first quarter compared to 30 per tonne a year ago and 41 per tonne in the fourth quarter petrochemical margins in europe while still relatively strong are generally been running below their 2018 levels marketing generated 343 million of adjusted net operating income in the first quarter stable compared to the first and fourth quarter of last year the combined downstream segment r c plus m s generated operating cash flow before working capital changes of 1 7 billion in the first quarter in line with the annual 6 5 billion to 7 billion contribution we have been delivering in recent years in terms of profitability the downstream continue to be remarkably strong with roace of 24 for the two segments over the past 12 months at the corporate level organic free cash flow was 3 2 billion in the first quarter the pre dividend organic breakeven is below 25 per barrel including net acquisition of 0 3 billion capital investment was 3 1 billion in the first quarter our guidance for 2019 capital investments remain at 15 billion to 16 billion in terms of profitability the group return on equity was 12 for the 12 months ended march 31 2019 stable compared to 12 for the year 2018 gearing at the end of the first quarter remained below 20 despite including the impact of applying the new ifrs 16 standard for leases which increased the net debt to capital ratio by more than 3 a strategic priority for the group is to maintain a strong balance sheet with gearing below 20 and we are committed to this objective even under the new ifrs rules we are also committed to increasing returns to shareholder and we are on track with the 2018 2020 framework that we presented in february we increased the first interim dividend for 2019 by 3 1 in euros and we are in line with the target to increase the dividend by 10 over the 2018 2020 period we have bought back the scrip shares issued since 2018 and we will eliminate the scrip dividend as of june last year we set a target to buy back 1 billion of stocks in a 60 per barrel brent environment and we bought back 1 5 billion this year we have set the target at 1 5 billion again based on a 60 per barrel environment and in the first quarter we bought back 350 million of stocks globally in dollars we returned 38 of operating cash flow before working capital to shareholders in the first quarter we are continuing to grow the company reduce the breakeven and manage our portfolio free cash flow is increasing particularly in the current environment and this allows us to deliver on our objective of strengthening the balance sheet and increasing returns to shareholder and now let s go to the q a question and answer session operator and your first question comes from the line of alastair syme of citi please go ahead alastair syme patrick two questions you set these cash flow targets for 2019 back in february i just wonder if you can quantify the impact the weaker spot gas prices might have had on this quarter both in terms of the conventional business and also the ig business i m just trying to figure out that if gas prices remain weak through the course of this year is that going to have a material impact on your guidance and i ll give you my second question i guess p1 made some comments on the fourth quarter results around u s shale that i think had been interpreted in different forms in the market i just wonder given all the activity in the u s in the last couple of weeks whether you can maybe set the record straight around total s view on u s acquisitions patrick de la chevardiã re thank you alastair i m glad to see that you definitely recovered from our trip to moscow to your question about cffo target we don t change the guidance it is true that currently spot prices are affected by a mild winter and we see gas price going down on europe and in asia including on top of that henry hub losing 1 per million btu and we expect short term pressure on gas price not only because of that but also because of supply i d like to remind you that most of our equity lng is sold long term there is one exception this quarter about yamal because yamal started up one year in advance and the long term contracts are not yet active so yamal had to sell its gas on spot market mainly in europe where the gas price is weak at the moment we expect henry hub to remain below 3 in europe on the other hand gas demand for power gen is incentivized by low gas price and by higher carbon price penalizing coal against gas in asia we still see china increasing import on a year on year and we see new importers like pakistan and bangladesh adding sizable volume so all in all i would say that demand is very strong last year demand increased by 10 11 actually if you have a look to our igrp results this first quarter the cash flow from ops from this segment was about 600 million in comparison to 400 million where so an increase of 50 in line with the increase of the production so the cffo target given in february i don t think we will change them now it is not yet the moment of course a weak gas price will have an impact but let s wait for at least two quarters to see how much it will impact the results the second question and it is not actually a surprise about m a and i am going to make it clear and we discussed that with patrick pouyanne and myself and the executive committee we are not interested in buying shale asset in the u s is it clear alastair i think so so can you please repeat it to your friend we are not interested of course there are other assets that we can be interested in for instance transfer of rights in brazil things like this but we are not interested in shale in the u s alastair syme patrick can i just draw you back on the first question on the guide as you think year on year is there a way of trying to help us quantify the impact of weaker spot prices on the overall upstream business patrick de la chevardiã re i m sorry i can t give you the numbers i don t have the numbers in my dossier wait for july and we will have a better understanding of the actual effect after two quarters operator your next question comes from the line of oswald clint of bernstein please go ahead your line is open oswald clint yes i d also like to ask about the integrated gas renewables power business certainly with the new return on capital employed numbers you ve broken out for that division the 7 4 that it s done over the last 12 months i think that fits in the 7 to 9 range that you kind of indicated back last september at and around 60 which is what we ve had in that time period so i just want to get a sense from you what has to happen to get that up closer to the top end of that 7 to 9 roace target please that s my first question and then secondly i wanted to ask about marketing you said the marketing areas were generally quite stable i think optically of course you re still down 7 year over year i also remember momar talking about the retail expansion initiatives adding probably quite easily 100 million per year so my question is i don t really see that coming through here this quarter is that part of the strategy working is the retail expansion program really starting to deliver the earnings patrick de la chevardiã re the first question about igrp first there is the effect of the start up of project at the moment we just started ichthys so let s add ichthys at full capacity with its upstream and then we will have the full benefit of ichthys in igrp that s the first comment and this is a very profitable upstream part in the lng business the upstream of ichthys second there will be more low carbon electricity i think so with the run of some ccgt that we bought recently and having as an objective a double digit roace i can t say i am 100 confident but the range 7 to 9 i am confident we are in the low side of this range at the moment because we just started some operation about m s m s the result is quite stable the net operating income is quite stable from quarter to another at around 350 million per quarter then we see the adjusted net operating income in 2018 was the result of this quarter in 2018 was due to the sale of totalerg that we lose we don t have any more operation in italy so we don t have the benefit of totalerg marketing under the total brand anymore i think those are the main effect operator and your next question comes from the line of biraj borkhataria of rbc biraj borkhataria i had a couple please the first one is could you just update us on the next steps for the lng project in png and how you expect to progress towards fid and the rough timings and the second one is just could you provide an update on your activities in argentina in the vaca muerta that would be helpful patrick de la chevardiã re let s start on argentina because it is quite simple we recently have signed an agreement for tax purposes in argentina where we pay some tax in advance and we re committed to upgrade our dd a so in argentina the overall financial situation is difficult we are quite happy technically with what we are doing on the vaca muerta we are strongly positioned we have about 300 000 or more than that 300 000 net acres in dry gas wet gas and oil windows it s low cost unconventional the question mark is are we ready to put a lot of fresh money in the country at the moment that is the question second question about papua new guinea total has 40 before government backing and 31 after we have signed an agreement exxon and oil search and total what is called a gas agreement with the state of papua new guinea defining the fiscal framework of the papua lng project this is a very important milestone and this allow us to enter into the feed phase that will lead to fid in 2020 i remind you that the project consists of two train of 2 7 million ton per year and we unlock about a billion barrels of reserves operator and your next question comes from the line of thomas adolff of crã dit suisse your line is now open thomas adolff just going back to alastair s question on gas prices and your exposure to spot if we said the broader market is roughly 75 80 contracted medium and long term and the rest on a spot or short term basis perhaps you can comment whether your portfolio is similarly positioned or whether you have less spot exposure considering the outage on yamal lng and secondly just staying with lng your guidance is for 40 million tonnes by 2020 both equity and third party gas you ve got a very good pre fid hopper and i wondered what your base case is for 2025 or 2020 2030 patrick de la chevardiã re thank you thomas first about gas price as i said to alastair basically our equity gas is sold long term some portion of it is spot like yamal at the moment because the long term contract are not yet active but basically it s long term then you have and this is roughly 50 of what we sell on the market the next 50 is contracted volumes that are sold either through formulas linked to brent or henry hub or either sold on the market on a spot basis i would say that a vast majority we try to have the vast majority of our contracted volumes equity or not committed to a long term buyer there is a remaining spot basis volume on the in our portfolio that we sell and we would and we are developing a network of regas terminal to have outlet for this gas and we have enough for instance we have a large base in europe at the moment we have projects in africa in cameron for instance that will help us to sell our gas on a spot basis taking advantage of the arbitrage which may happen by time to time in different locations but i think that more important for us is that even if today spot prices are weak which is the reality this does not jeopardize our long term view there is no oversupply that we see on the market by 2024 there is maybe an oversupply today maybe i said but we don t see foresee any more oversupply by 2024 demand is growing currently at a rate of more than 10 a year and we are quite confident that our strategy to increase our exposure to lng is the right one so next question was about what is the guidance beyond 2020 for lng as you noticed we set a target of 40 million tonnes per year by 2020 the equity production by 2025 will be around 30 3 0 million tonnes per annum and this is representing a growth of 50 basically trading is half of the equity production today so this may be helping you to figure out what could be the guidance by 2025 having in mind this equity production by 2025 of 30 million tonnes per year operator and your next questions come from the line of jon rigby of ubs please go ahead your line is open jon rigby the first is on asian gas which has seen a big pick up in production levels since the start of last year and obviously some of that laterally has been ichthys but i just wondered a couple of things one is where are we with ichthys are we still just running with 1 train the second question is is it all related to that is glng seeing some better performance in terms of gas production in the last sort of three or four quarters just trying to get an idea about the trajectory of production there and the second just sticking on the gas theme and the lng theme is i was struck by your investment into the driftwood because you already had exports i believe out of sabine and obviously with the engie assets as well so can you just sort of elaborate or give a bit more color around the strategy around how you allocate investment dollars to u s export i would have thought to my mind anyway perhaps an expansion of your existing engie positions might have been more economic but i d just be interested to hear your perspective patrick de la chevardiã re asian gas currently two trains started up at ichthys in october and in november actually the ramp up is ongoing the production currently in march was about 300 000 barrels per day equivalent i remind you that both two trains are filling their production on an oil related formula mainly to japan as we are this is a japan inc project i d like to remind you also that we as a partner we are not so happy with the cost increase we were facing end of last year that we reduced our stake by 4 we divested 4 and that currently our remaining stake is 26 also keep in mind on ichthys that thanks to the upstream where it s producing about 100 000 barrels per day at full capacity we are making a lot of cash in this project then you have another question on glng honestly i don t know how i don t have the answer i ask mike to return to you because i don t have the answer for glng sorry for that the outlook for the far east lng production i see the blue sky policy from china being a big driver and able to be the market where all far east well positioned low cost production can go on top of that i don t know if you have been to china recently but discussing with the people the blue sky policy is a real policy they want to clean their city and that s part of the appropriation of the politician to be nice with their people driftwood you know that as an equity partner in tellurian terminal we enjoy offtake at good condition at a lower price at a nominal offtake this is why we are interested in offtaking our stake of the production of the driftwood asset and on top of that the capital we allocate to this project is not a lot of dollar it s about 200 million i think if i will remember operator and your next questions come from the line of lydia rainforth of barclays lydia rainforth two questions if i could the first one just on the downstream and the refining environment and just what you re seeing at the moment and whether you re already seeing any impact from the imo side as yet or how it can all play out and then the second one was around what you re looking at in terms of costs and capex are you seeing any either inflation on the capex side or on the cost side is that proceeding according to what you expected at the capital markets day patrick de la chevardiã re our trading people on imo 2020 started to see an effect on the market started to see actually on the prices of light oil we i haven t seen in the first quarter any impact of the imo 2020 it may be too early it may be a matter of a quarter or two on the cost side for inflation the question is has cost deflation bottomed out i don t think so outside of the u s we are not in the u s onshore i remind you and we are not willing to go i repeat it outside of that we don t see inflation coming back currently on the market thank you lydia operator and your next questions come from the line of irene himona of societe generale irene himona my questions are both on cash flow items firstly if we look at dd a in the quarter leaving out asset impairment it appears that underlying dd a jumped about 10 sequentially obviously there is a lot more production i just wonder if you can give us some full year guidance here should we expect the q1 level to sort of to remain for the rest of the year and then secondly on working capital i realize you look at free cash flow excluding this but there was a substantial increase in q1 oil prices are even higher now you told us in the past i believe that you have a sort of committee watching this or managing it i wonder again if there is any guidance you can give us for the full year in terms of working capital please patrick de la chevardiã re your first question on dd a this is true that there is an increase in first quarter 19 of about 0 30 per boe this is due to the start up of cash equity projects like egina kaombo and ichthys as we are expecting production to continue and grow i see that i can expect dd a to continue and increase following the production increase start up after start up the working cap honestly i m not very happy anyway because we were in a 60 environment first quarter this year two elements in that we will try and control the working capital once again in the second quarter but there is an effect of the oil price which is still rising which has an effect on the inventories and it will have an effect on the working cap so i can t say that i am not happy to see the oil price at 70 i am happy with that but this will have an effect in my view on the working cap of the second quarter operator and your next question comes from the line of christopher kuplent of bank of america please go ahead christopher kuplent patrick just wonder whether you could give us a little more detail on the impact from ifrs 16 is that another reason why d a sequentially has increased also any color you can give us on how the full year guidance you gave us in february is broken down by quarter is this should we divide that by 4 can you give us some sort of insight now that you have the q1 result in front of you how much of net income and more importantly net cost of debt as well as cffo items have moved because of the ifrs alone and second question and that s really just more looking for confirmation your 15 billion to 16 billion full year capex guidance includes things like payments for arctic two please can you confirm and maybe give us a little bit of an insight how much now that the deal is closed how much cash outflow you are expecting in 2019 from arctic two patrick de la chevardiã re so ifrs 16 a very interesting topic this has an effect of 3 on gearing this will remain stable the impact on capital employed is between 5 billion and 6 billion actually i think it is 5 7 billion in the first quarter it has an effect of about 1 billion per year on our debt adjusted cash flow so per quarter 200 million to 250 million on the net income it has no effect and those guidelines which were given in february remain valid the capex guidance of 15 billion to 16 billion are including the arctic lng 2 payment the 600 million that we have paid already and that s it i mean in 2019 we will pay 600 million for arctic lng 2 and it s included in our 15 billion 16 billion guidance christopher kuplent okay can i just ask one follow up on arctic 2 you ve got a cagr in terms of your top line out there for 2022 would arctic 2 be additive to that cagr please patrick de la chevardiã re it s included operator and your next question comes from the line of lucas herrmann of deutsche bank please go ahead lucas herrmann i m not sure if i should be saying thank you as well for all the help over the years because i m not aware if this is your last conference call or not but whatever many thanks and now the irritating part i wanted to push you a little bit more on lydia s question around cost not least on lng given the level of activity that s starting to build in the industry and the number of you that are trying to push projects into what seems like a gap that s going to be filled very quickly so question one was really just to check and go back on lydia s question of whether you re seeing anything happening around lng secondly i wonder whether you care to comment on profile around tempa rossa what s happening and also make an observation on cameron the other project that is due to start up this year and thirdly very simply the guidance you gave on cash flow per 10 move how does that split if at all between upstream and igrp patrick de la chevardiã re okay thank you for your word lucas but this is not my last call the last my last call is in july on cost honestly when i said to lydia that i don t see we don t see any cost inflation in our main businesses which is deep offshore conventional onshore offshore and lng this is based on our thinking about of what we see actually on the market i remind you that chinese yard are currently competing with japanese singaporean and korean yard on top of that now russia is building its own capacity to build lng plant so we see strongest competition a large capacity available which lead us to think that we are not yet at the time where we will see prices going up thank you for the question on tempa rossa because honestly as you know technically we are ready italy has always been a difficult country for us we are still waiting for an authorization from the administration shall i say it is a mess no not exactly but we are not happy lucas herrmann you can t comment at all can you patrick patrick de la chevardiã re we will touch that obviously in may can you repeat your question about the split between e p and igrp lucas herrmann yes the guidance on sorry the guidance on sensitivity 10 move is 3 2 billion of cash flow or 2 78 i can t remember quite offhand on ebit given you ve split out the lng activities or a number of the lng activities which have a sensitivity to the oil price how does that cash impact split by divisional profit impact as well split by division is that clear patrick de la chevardiã re about i would say that in our sensitivity about 5 no i don t want to give you any figure i m going to give you i m going to make a mistake so no i don t have the answer but i understand your question ask it again in july and for sure i will answer operator and your last question comes from the line of jason gabelman of cowen jason gabelman i just wanted to touch on share buybacks i know in the press release you said in a 60 oil price you would buy back 1 5 billion this year clearly oil prices are well above that so just looking for updated thoughts around what level you think share buybacks could come in at if oil prices stay at this level or if brent persists above 70 a barrel for the rest of the year patrick de la chevardiã re okay first quarter last year sorry we gave a guidance of 1 billion at 60 and we actually buy back 1 5 billion because we were at around 70 71 if i well remember per barrel we are currently at the moment buying at a pace of 1 5 billion a year but what we have done in the first last year is an idea of what can be done but it s very premature to believe that the oil price will remain at 70 for the full year honestly i have no idea it was 60 first quarter we are temporarily maybe at 70 at the moment so i don t like to make forecast on oil prices and taking the conclusion of what can be a very wrong assumption so i m sorry at the moment we are on a 1 5 billion program at 60 last year we gave the guidance of 1 billion and we did 1 5 billion then up to you to dream a little bit thank you that was the first quarter results which are another example of total s ability to deliver on clearly articulated strategy as you see we are growing our cash flow effectively investing in growing businesses and using free cash flow to increase returns to our shareholder bye bye and see you in july operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today thank you for participating and you may now disconnect
textile industry contributes 57 percent of total export volumes and 8 5 of the gdp of pakistan annual export figure closed last fiscal year at 25 billion out of which 13 53 billion was from textiles according to textile policy 2014 2019 textile exports to increase by double i e from 13 billion to 26 billion which could have created some 3 million additional jobs government also extended export package and preferential interest rates for working capital exigencies and capital expenditures related to the industry but target never achieved in this period bangladesh and india showed growth trends in export of textile products and the same can be observed to date also though textile policy has aggressive targets but it seems that the policy makers failed to address the real problem that eventually resulted failure of achieving it one big issue was exchange rate which kept under control by last government artificially due to which pakistani exportable products remained expensive internationally until devaluation started secondly input cost increased considerably related to procurement of cotton and energy whereas this phenomenon seems never ending last but not the least textile industry itself hesitates to grow into manufacturing of value added products which is evident from percentage of value added output increasing as compared to basic textile product i e yarn now after devaluation of pak rupee exports from this sector at large will be increased in short term but effect of devaluation will be offset by increase of other input costs in longer run previous government has controlled pak rupee devaluation by injecting foreign loans which resulted influx of imports into pakistani markets and made our exportable items expensive internationally they also took heavy loans from local banks and increased government spending which increased money supply due to this cosmetic positive scenario of economy where inflation was around 3 sbp discount rate was too low resulting lower finance cost of businesses on the contrary present government aggressively devaluated the local currency by not taking more loans for controlling exchange rate artificially this resulted pakistaniexportable products cheaper in international market which attracted future orders in return but on the other hand interest rates increased almost double which increased finance cost accordingly due to massive devaluation cost of producing energy increased together with cost of spare parts for maintenance and dyeing chemical for value added products moreover cotton price in pakistan is too high if it may be compared to regional cotton producers like india owing to the fact that pakistan lags behind cotton producing targets each year recent trade war between usa and china together with protest against low wages in bangladesh is blessing in disguise for value added segment of pakistan as buyers of textile products across the world are thinking to diversify their supplier countries pakistan needs 15 million bales of cotton for textile consumption whereasitproduces only 10 million bales on average in next 5 years demand will surge to 20 million bales which require special attention towards related agriculture sector including but not limited to availability of quality seeds and fertilizers energy cost is a major input cost of per spindle work for producing a yarn of any count reportedly subsidized electricity rate of rs 10 11 per unit is available to export based textile units however this is almost 30 35 of per spindle per month cost of production which is around rs 30 this varies with economies of scale this means that previous government rhetoric of providing electricity doesn t suits to manufacturing units which require cheaper electricity that could have been produced from increasing renewable energy sources specially from water wind and solar it is not justifiable to put all responsibility on government for the performance of textile sector government is already providing billions of rupees through export package duty draw backs relaxation for import for export purpose tax rebates special electricity rate and preferential interest rate regime for working capital requirements and to import machinery yet the fact is that despite of this support textile industry is not able to increase its export share which requires some effort from the industry as well first of all textile owners need to inject further equity by raising capital with a mix of using banking credits in high interest rate scenario it will reduce their finance cost which will result in bottom line to grow secondly textile managers should focus on value added products which have a larger market with built in high marginsinstead of making basic products and depending on other income through investing activities last but not the least textile industry can encourage and support farmers to grow high yield cotton together with government of pakistan through helping farmer to procure better seed and fertilizers recent trade war between usa and china together with protest against low wages in bangladesh is blessing in disguise for value added segment of pakistan as buyers of textile products across the world are thinking to diversify their supplier countries though bangladesh is a major buyer of yarn from pakistan and slowdown in their economy can affect export of this basic textile product yet this is a high time for shifting towards value added products to get more share of export with better margins moreover free trade agreement with china is being revised through which additional export of textile goods to brotherly country may bemade in longer run cash subsidies are not sustainable for economy which has huge loans to repay the government role here should be like a facilitator throughout the value chain while the entrepreneurs should put effort to enter into those segments of this value chain which can bring business with good margins this value chain starts from production of cotton to final value added textile product where combination of government support together with efforts from entrepreneur to come out of its comfort zone that is to be heavily dependent on spinning units can fetch results as stated in textile policy the writer is an economist columnist and a chartered banker uk

morgan stanley said china is becoming a net importer of capital as the country ages it will require net inflows rising to us400 billion a year by the end of the next decade beijing will have to compete for capital like everybody else hence this year s push by xi for more joint ventures with foreign banks and funds the official report recast the venture as an open inclusive initiative without political ideology it is not a china club it said this counters worldwide criticism that the belt and road is a cloak for strategic expansion as well as being a vehicle for debt diplomacy for the poorest countries but at the same time china needs the world s money china s overseas lending is almost entirely financed in us dollars and they are running short of those dollars said george magnus from the oxford university s china centre magnus said the drive to transform the yuan into a global funding currency is doomed in a context of tight capital controls and zero trade surpluses they have to tone down the hype and look for other countries to work with he said when you bring in outside money you lose control said jonathan hillman from the centre for strategic and international studies in washington hillman said the belt and road is an elastic term some fully signed up members such as korea have received almost nothing refuseniks such as india or germany get investment anyway misadventures japan s overseas investments are larger than those of china but are happening without fanfare the multilateral adb quietly lent us36 billion last year for development projects after the hubris comes scrutiny or moving from big freehand brushwork to fine brushwork in the elegant euphemism of the communist party the catalogue of misadventures is by now well known in europe montenegro s highway to nowhere wins the prize the ambitious link from the adriatic port of bar through mountains to the serbian hinterland was deemed unsustainable in two feasibility studies there is not enough potential traffic to recoup toll revenue the export import bank of china paid for a secret study that concluded otherwise work by china communications construction was launched the terms of the contract mean that any dispute must be settled in chinese courts in the case of default china can seize montenegrin land the imf says the unfinished project has pushed montenegro s debt ratio from 63 per cent to 80 per cent of gdp and is testing fiscal limits the fallout risks delaying eu accession since the country now breaches maastricht rules in the case of the hambantota port in sri lanka where the government signed away a 99 year lease after failing to repay chinese loans the interest rate on the debt was 6 3 per cent chinese money doesn t come cheap this is two to three times what the world bank of the adb charge there is a myth out there that chinese money comes cheap said hillman from csis lending practices are very opaque one of the best things the chinese can do at this point is to make the terms of the contracts public as all the multilateral development banks do he said perhaps the most bizarre feature of the belt and road is that it has become the lender of last resort for the construction of coal plants according to the institute for energy economics and financial analysis a coal fired power plant in shanxi province chinese lenders are funding us36 billion of coal projects across the world credit ap pushing coal the ieefa says chinese lenders chiefly state banks are funding us36 billion of coal projects across the world that will add 102 gigawatts of coal capacity only a third use best practice ultra supercritical technology this is happening at a time when the world bank multilateral bodies and most western lenders are pulling out of coal altogether a de minimis measure to avert runaway climate change chinese state entities are deeply involved in the construction and management of the plants these behemoths are finding a new lease of life abroad as coal curbs tighten at home the belt and road is an off ramp for china s own excess capacity problems it is often old technology and these plants will have a shelf life of 30 or even 50 years said hillsman they are concentrated in countries such as bangladesh vietnam and pakistan where solar or wind power are cost competitive and will become cheaper the debtors risk being stuck with stranded assets within a decade the ieefa says china s state entities are the chief villains private chinese companies are gravitating to renewable belt and road ventures since they are more profitable it takes active distortion to keep coal going beijing is also pushing its high co2 coal to chemical industry across developing asia

oregon s liberal democratic senator ron wyden most likely knew from the get go that his idea for new taxes on assets and investments wouldn t get a lot of traction so much so that a news release tweet or bulletin taking credit for his own proposal can t be found on the senator s official website yet senator wyden who is the ranking member of the senate s finance committee in early april told the financial press he is developing a mark to market approach to tax unrealized capital gains in simple terms he proposes a levy a tax on investments like real estate or stocks based on valuations of their holdings each year with all annual gains treated like income even gains that have not been realized this mark to market accounting practice of updating the value of an asset would tax all capital gains like income at a maximum rate of 37 percent the present capital gains tax functions this way when capital assets like stocks or real estate are bought the purchase price becomes the cost basis and when they are sold the difference between the cost basis and the sale price becomes a capital gain with a couple stipulations involving the length of time an asset is held i e long or short term and breakpoints based on a taxpayer s overall income the current capital gains tax in the u s ranges between 15 percent and 23 8 percent when an asset is sold for a profit after a year or more it is taxed at long term rates while rates if assets are sold after less than a year i e short term generally equate to ordinary income tax rates so what could possibly go wrong with systematic annual taxation that would be extraordinarily difficult and complex to implement while loaded with potential to disrupt and devastate the nation s financial markets first and foremost compliance and its associated costs would it even be humanly possible to annually value the wide array of capital assets that constitute our nation s economy how do you go about fairly valuing without transactions to price them everything from venture capital to private debt to stock options to cyclical businesses to illiquid real estate and beyond then what kind of drain on the u s economy would such annual fiscal gymnastics impose as everyone s asset and money managers maneuver to value assets particularly illiquid ones with the objective of tax efficiency of course senator wyden promises but has not yet provided a detailed explanation of exactly how all this will work some if not many investors would just not bother and take their capital elsewhere another problem how would smaller investors even otherwise moderately wealthy investors pay taxes on investments that have not yet returned cash to them senator wyden must know that americans saving and investing for the future do not possess surpluses of cash in addition to those assets to pay additional taxes the obvious is that only when a stock real estate or another asset is sold does an investor obtain the cash to monetize the gains of his investment there is good reason why we presently tax only realized gains in america and not notional ones because one is a tangible gain while the other is only an abstract number on paper until it is sold senator wyden with a worldview common among liberal democrats further sees the issue in terms of binary economic and class distinctions in announcing his proposal he asserted there are two tax codes in america the first is for nurses police officers and factory workers those who earn wages and pay taxes with every paycheck the second is for millionaires and billionaires those who use their wealth to build more wealth paying what they want when they want everyone needs to pay their fair share that statement by itself ignores the facts that the top one percent already pay a greater share of individual income taxes 37 3 percent than the bottom 90 percent combined 30 5 percent or that more americans than ever own stocks and almost two thirds of americans own their homes additionally many americans are not rich and wealthy like wyden s pejorative millionaires and billionaires and do not fit neatly into either group they are america s so called middle class yes they earn wages and pay taxes with every paycheck but over time they are fortunate enough to save some of the money the government has allowed them to keep they go on to invest their dollars sometimes well and other times not so well over the years the growth and appreciation of those assets enable them to raise families pay their bills even enjoy life and increase their likelihood of making it through retirement without running out of money just where would an always benevolent federal government draw the line on who and what is taxed and for how much critics mostly agree that wyden s proposal has little chance of passing any time soon but it is a siren call to those lured by its potential to raise vast sums to feed the seemingly insatiable demands of government spending funds that could otherwise remain available to taxpayers to circulate in the economy as they see fit is it too much to expect the senior democrat on the senate s finance committee to understand that such a tax proposal disregards the lifeblood of our economy investment senator wyden s proposal if implemented would discourage capital formation increased productivity investment risk taking and wealth creation such an idea embodies an entire party s diametrically different political philosophy of wealth as a divisive political wedge and millionaires and billionaires as a populist foil instead of concentrating on growing the economy and creating jobs for the benefit of all americans maybe vice president mike pence said it best with his remarks at cpac the annual conservative convention in march the truth is we want to make poor people richer they want to make rich people poorer senator wyden s proposal is just a very bad idea that all americans regardless of their politics could agree should never see the light of day chris j krisinger colonel usaf ret served in policy advisory positions in both the pentagon and the state department he was a national defense fellow at harvard

in one of the newspaper dailies i read an article by an author who criticised the recent women s renaissance for focusing on the right to vote and be elected without addressing the problems facing women as wives and mothers and this he argues signals a complete collapse of the roads leading to the true path of the nation writing in 1949 doriya shafik one of the most prominent egyptian feminists and founder of the journal bint al nil engages with the various meanings of a housewife shafik who studied philosophy at the sorbonne saw that elite women of the palace and the upper classes needed to use their moral and material resources to transform the dreadful conditions of the poorer egyptian population in fact they had a special mission to bridge the gap between women from the upper classes and those from poorer ones responding to the author of the article cited above who voiced a common sentiment at the time she argued he primary role of women is in making the life of the people and any demand for rights is nothing but a vehicle to achieve the higher social goals for the egyptian woman building new generations of perfect wives and mothers shafik s position was consistent with a new family ideology that had reached widespread acceptance by the 1920s among the upper classes of egyptian society this ideology propagated the conjugal family as the elemental unit of society the welfare of which was necessary for the development of the nation the new ideology entailed the education of women who would then become better companions for their husbands and more suitable for their role of child rearing and household labour more broadly while this new ideology was not concerned with women s rights it became a precursor for the feminism of that period of which doriya shafik was a proponent she claimed that women s education and political rights were all for the happiness of the egyptian home with its housewife whose presence and dedication was always expected this labour exerted in the production of life almost exclusively done by women is in the words of maria mies the perennial precondition of all other forms of productive labour this insight was not present in elite feminist circles at the time and yet by the time of the founding of egypt s postcolonial state we see debates around social reproduction or making the life of the people become increasingly prominent what explains this shift and how can we trace the presence of social reproduction in feminist debates from the 1950s onwards the following contribution looks at social reproduction in the context of egypt beginning with the period during which doriya shafik was active the founding of egypt s postcolonial state and then moving to the beginning of egypt s neoliberal project in the 1970s social reproduction initially conceptualised as a marxist feminist framework for understanding the unpaid work that goes into reproducing both the household and the labour force asked the famous question if labour produces the commodity who produces labour challenging the tendency of orthodox marxist scholarship to ignore the importance of unpaid labour often done by women to the evolution of capitalism social reproduction as a theory made a crucial intervention into marxist analysis nevertheless its emphasis on gender as the primary means of understanding social reproduction meant that it became a narrow approach to the question of unpaid labour and capitalist exploitation we aim here to critically analyse the intersecting social structures that come together around social reproduction building on the black feminist tradition and the italian autonomous feminist tradition in particular claudia jones s concept of triple oppression to read how colonialism class and gender come together at different points in egyptian history and silvia federici s analytical approach that takes imperialism as central to the workings of social reproduction focusing on the context of egypt we look at different historical moments during which debates on care work and motherhood cropped up and ask what these debates tell us about broader questions of capitalist reproduction increased empirical attention to the everyday workings of social reproduction in postcolonial contexts can shed light on the ways social reproduction theory is imagined and what it would mean to resist unpaid labour we have chosen to structure this article around two examples spanning the twentieth century to highlight how social reproduction was embedded within debates around colonialism capitalism and gender echoing frantz fanon we emphatically believe that by situating our analysis in the colony postcolony marxist analyses of capitalism must be re conceptualised to account for colonial difference as if the child has sprouted from the land that is her mother social reproduction in the post colonial moment during the british colonial period social reproduction came to be defined by the parameters of colonial capital and changes in property relations as well as a domestication of some colonial myths about the nature of eastern women this period saw changes in the land tenure system accompanied by urbanisation industrialisation and investments in key sectors of the economy this was in addition to social reforms that targeted the nuclear family as the foundation of national progress through new policies on population and reproduction these new policies entailed legislation on women s labour specifically limiting their night work as well as a new interest in the subject of birth control contestation over the meaning of egyptian womanhood during this period was part of the debates surrounding domesticity culture and modernity that developed in the late nineteenth century with british colonialism through the figure of the ignorant and oppressed muslim woman in egyptian families british colonial officials questioned the moral and political authority of egyptians for self governance remarkably various colonial tropes of modern motherhood were adopted later by nationalist elites constructing a new vision for a modern and independent middle east in fact modern motherhood became essential for the collective dream of independence where the household would serve as a microscosm for the nation the modern mother would nurture the children of the nation through her reproductive labour this also came with a new family ideology that changed the precolonial idea of the maintenance obedience relationship where women received financial support from their husbands in return for their obedience and docility albeit without an explicit legal obligation to do housework or care for the children while women still did all the housework it was viewed as something beyond what was expected of them this was partly because the obedient wife almost like a prisoner restricted herself to the home accordingly husbands were expected to treat their wives with respect and to tolerate their overbearance especially with the prevalence of patriarchal notions surrounding their deficiency in intellect and faith with the new colonial family ideology women s obedience came to be understood as an obligation to do housework this new ideology cultivated modern motherhood as a remedy for backwardness and inability of self rule modern motherhood it was argued was to be cultivated through the science of home economics and sound principles of child rearing at the turn of the century courses on washing ironing sewing and cooking were being offered to women across all social classes after independence all of this changed largely because of the emergence of state feminism which was one of the principles that defined the new nation state egypt like other post independence states in africa and asia embarked upon a comprehensive legal economic and cultural programme that consolidated the power and political legitimacy of the post colonial regime women were granted the right to vote in 1956 and new labour laws iterated the principle of non discrimination on the basis of gender women were entitled to fifty days of paid maternity leave and employers were forced to provide day care if they employed more than one hundred women accordingly as mervat hatem argues the state made reproduction a public concern women s liberation was seen as necessary for building a new modern republican and anti colonial nation state even in the political union with syria solidarity between syrian and egyptian women was viewed as instrumental to the cohesion of the united arab republic 1958 1961 in its april 1958 issue al hilal one of the oldest and most influential cultural magazines of the arab world ran an article celebrating the role of women in the union with syria written by author and professor of literature aisha abel rahman writing with her pen name bint al shati she argues that egyptian and syrian women are conscious of the role of virtuous motherhood in the collective national struggle and mindful of their responsibility in uniting the forces of the nation that were divided by the pretences of colonialism from the heart of asia to the african maghreb women are struggling to unite the arab nation the daughter of algeria is standing in her war for independence immortalising in history the most heroic and beautiful scene of women s anti colonial struggle in another 1958 article published in al hilal and written by the inspector of art at the ministry of education the author celebrates mothers day through depictions of motherhood in ancient and modern art an ancient egyptian sculpture depicts the child as part and parcel of the mother s body as if the child has sprouted from the land that is her mother the depiction of the fertile land and the nation as a mother in works of art is a common imagery used by nationalists beth baron and other feminist writers have shown how egypt was centred in the national imagination as a woman and a mother however while the imagery of the mother served the national consciousness it effaced her labour at home subsuming it under the allusive category of love and national duty state feminism adopted this metaphor to consolidate the role of women as both active participants in the public sphere and as dutiful mothers serving the nation through social reproduction domestic labour was as central to the formation of a new modern state and yet it was erased in the celebration of women as equal citizens working in the new public sphere of the postcolonial nation the expansion of women s visible and accordingly also invisible labour meant that dramatic shifts were happening in gender relations even if told only through changes to the former however this cannot be understood outside of the particularities of anti colonialism which centred on modernising the nation with all the gendered effects this entailed one way in which we can see these dramatic changes expressed in the everyday is through novels and other forms of writing published during this period for instance even the celebrated feminist novel the open door written by latifa al zayat in 1960 and its later rendition into a film directed by henri barakat in 1963 links domestic work with immorality and promiscuity the novel was written at the height of nasser s popularity a few years after the nationalisation of the suez canal but was set during the anti colonial struggles of the 1940s and 1950s the novel links the patriarchy of middle class sensibilities to complicity with the colonial authority while the novel successfully makes the connection between the liberation of women with the liberation of the nation it fails to address the complexitites of domestic work in fact it participates in a familiar discourse that devalues and denigrates this form of labour laila the main protagonist is in love with her cousin essam who has a kind heart and loves her back essam gradually disappoints her with his possessiveness and his cowardice when he doesn t volunteer in the peoples resistance against the british in port said laila loses faith in love when she sees him being seduced by sayeda the sexualised and immoral maid promiscuous sayeda is pitted against laila whose freedom from the confines of the family becomes tied to the freedom of the nation as laila is breaking from old norms of middle class respectability through her anti colonial political activism domestic work remains devalued and tied to notions of immorality and female promiscuity when she finds love again in the figure of hussein it is tied to her duty to the nation in a rare depiction of women rejecting hypocritical middle class moralities as a happy ending the last scene shows laila leaving her family with its conservative beliefs she runs after a train heading to port said full of volunteers including hussein to participate in the resistance movement against the tripartite aggression after the nationalisation of the suez canal in 1956 the novel considered a feminist literary manifesto linked women s individual freedom to the collective national liberation capturing the spirit of a new vision of post colonial modernity where women became active participants in the political life of the nation while the new state broke older taboos on women s role in the public sphere reflecting a radical and progressive shift it also accommodated a conservative stand on the role of women in the household and family by maintaining the idea that propriety and respectability for women lay at home where domestic labour continued to be denigrated and devalued regarded as unstable emotional beings women could not be trusted with the right to divorce except in cases of impotence or incurable illness in fact all efforts to reform the personal status law failed and it remained in its pre revolution formulation while women were celebrated as the drivers of modernity and progress in the public sphere they were denied their autonomy should they decide to abandon the household or the social factory as federici puts it a woman s labour outside of the home as well as her active participation in political life was considered complementary to her duties in the household showcasing the successes of import substitution and industrialisation policy the state introduced household management devices to help the working mother through the washing machine the gas stove and the vacuum cleaner women would be able to balance between their work outside and inside of the home the nuclear family came to be governed by the new family planning programme that propagated contraception as the way forward for the modern working class egyptian family through contraception and industrialisation the post colonial state configured its identity and in the process maintained the double burden placed on women in society in what follows we discuss the complete disintegration of this regime which albeit imperfect provided basic social services for women that would soon disintegrate with the infitah i m 23 but i feel like i m 50 egypt s neoliberal project and a deepening domestic burden the 1970s saw the emergence of a new global project premised on freeing the market from state intervention in order to create economic growth this project can be read as a counter revolution against both anticolonial movements and socialist movements that had dominated much of the world since the 1950s the 1970s therefore marked the defeat of anticolonialism and in the particular context of egypt nasserism anwar el sadat became president of egypt in 1971 heralding the start of a neoliberal transformation one of the most significant shifts was the opening up of egypt s economy to foreign investment and imports known as infitah this coincided with the imf and world bank intervention into much of the global south through structural adjustment programmes which had massive effects on public social services that had been established under nasser in particular structural adjustment targeted health and education as sectors within which states were over spending the same sectors within which cuts would have major ramifications for social reproduction the imf led structural adjustment which can be understood as a form of neo imperialism is therefore central to tracking changes in social reproduction in postcolonial contexts highlighting the intersections of empire nation and gender and the importance of taking an intersectional approach to social reproduction what the imf saw as egypt s extremely slow liberalisation process led them to increasingly pressure egypt into signing a structural adjustment deal which it did in 1977 the major aspect of this deal was sadat s promise to cut subsidies and reduce government spending for public services alongside this there was a concerted effort to construct the private sector as the engine of economic growth which included opening up to foreign capital and turning towards the goal of profitability rather than national development this was to have very particular gendered effects on the one hand nasserism s state centric approach to gender equality which was very much built on the public sector and women s labour within it was abandoned on the other hand the shift to the private sector opened up opportunities for a very small minority of women moreover even for those middle class women for whom opportunities were now available these often came at the price of an increased work load given the continuing presence of social reproductive work as mervat hatem writes with the retreat of the state as a social and economic agent of change many official commitments to gender inequality were either ignored or abandoned within and without the state sector it is the young lower middle class and working class women who bore the brunt of these painful economic and social adjustments additionally the benefits offered by the private sector did not match the ones the public sector had been able to provide notably job security long maternity leaves and fixed working hours perhaps most importantly however infitah had the effect of feminising a certain part of the labour force the inflation and migration that were products of the open door system served to push urban and rural working class women into the labour force while most male workers were interested in the better paying jobs of the private sector and or of the gulf economies in order to deal with spiralling prices women workers preferred employment in the public sector because it offered such benefits as subsidised transportation child care and maternity leave it is thus clear that the gendered effects of infitah in the public sphere were multiple what we are interested in here is what happened to the gaps that opened up after cuts to subsidies and reduced government spending because these gaps were most notably felt in the public sector provision of social welfare they had very clear gendered effects to trace some of these gaps we turn here to sonallah ibrahim s dhat beginning with the 1952 revolution and ending in the late 1980s which explores egyptian politics through the life of the central character dhat as well as her family and friends as she navigates new challenges in the face of an ever changing political economy sonallah ibrahim is one of egypt s most prominent novelists and a self defined communist intellectual born on the day of the 1952 revolution dhat herself is very much symbolic of egypt as a nation and all of the changes it has undergone as samia mehrez writes this is not a novel that critiques a regime of the past rather it is one that hits hard at the present in all its manifestations social economic cultural ideological religious political the word dhat itself is also symbolic mehrez points out that when used alone the word dhat means self in arabic a tactic ibrahim used to displace the focus from an individual onto the collective in other words the linguistic suggestion is that dhat means the self the viewer is in a sense encouraged to relate to the character this is not a story about an individual egyptian woman named dhat but a story or a series of stories about egypt and egyptians the text offers an incisive commentary on how political and economic changes seep into the ordinary ness of the everyday indeed social reproductive work can often only be traced through a focus on the everyday it is precisely in the changing rhythms and tempos of everyday life that we can see the deepening of the domestic burden following infitah here we focus specifically on the theme of work and exhaustion that permeates much of the novel during the era of infitah and how this is represented through the everyday travails of dhat indeed as we move from the 1960s into the 1970s it increasingly seems to be the case that dhat is always working whether at home or at her job at a national news agency she barely has time to recover let alone relax she is in a constant state of movement which in turn means she is in a constant state of tiredness in contrast her husband abdel meguid is portrayed very differently although he goes to work once he comes home he spends his time relaxing for dhat work outside and inside merge into one endless day many of the scenes in this section become a repetitive representation of this endless cycle where dhat wakes up goes to work comes home only to begin what appears to be a second shift this invokes feminist understandings of the second or third shift where coming home after work supposedly in order to relax often means nothing more than starting a new shift or what can even seem like an entirely new work day in addition to this and in addition to her full time job in the public sector we also begin to see dhat getting involved in numerous small business schemes from selling electric cooking pots to sewing lingerie this very much captures the spirit of infitah where entrepreneurship was encouraged and the economic burden individualised prices of everything begin to steadily increase and the flood of luxury imports creates pressure on middle class or socially mobile families to purchase items seen as representative of class privilege brought together this created immense pressure on families to add other sources of income despite the idea that this was an era during which egyptians could supposedly all prosper we see dhat do the laundry cook clean and take care of the children all while seemingly exhausted indeed the images that stay with you from many of these scenes focus on the increasing tiredness dhat embodies and the ways in which her pace slows down over time this eventually culminates in her saying i m 23 but i feel 50 such reference to social reproductive work and its effects on the body and mind is telling it is precisely in the body that women often feel the effects of simply doing too much one coping mechanism we see dhat make use of is that of retreating into the bathroom several times dhat slowly walks to the bathroom locks herself inside sits down on the closed toilet seat and proceeds to cry what is interesting about the bathroom is the steady decay that overtakes it the bathroom is not only an escape from financial and marital difficulties but also a physical manifestation of those difficulties in one scene in the television show based on the novel the bathroom is run down broken and leaking water into their neighbour s apartment leading to a crisis in the family after a visit to a couple who had been her university friends and who are now evidently wealthy dhat comes away feeling even worse about her own apartment and specifically her bathroom it is only after dhat uses her own money which she saved through exhausting sewing work late at night that the bathroom is fixed and rendered respectable the bathroom is interesting from a metaphorical perspective particularly in its representation of egypt s decaying infrastructure during this period indeed we see decay both in terms of infrastructure and in terms of public services become the central theme in the novel from the late 1960s onwards the refusal by the government to attend to infrastructural weaknesses results in a rapid increase in accidents and collapses and we also see the collapse of the education and healthcare sectors following the withdrawal of the state this is consistently represented against the lack of decay during the nasser years when dhat and her husband attended well funded public schools their children on the other hand must attend private schools which their parents have to work extra hard in order to afford this burden affects both dhat and her husband but as we see throughout the novel has especially high ramifications for dhat who already has an extremely heavy social reproductive workload sonallah ibrahim s masterpiece thus provides a fascinating lens for looking into the gendered changes brought about by varying national projects in egypt highlighting the connections between gender empire and capital in relation to increasing workloads we see how infitah has had very particular ramifications for women especially because of the withdrawal of social services and the individualisation of the economic burden the novel not only shows the multiple shifts dhat has to complete each day to support her family but also the embodied nature of this extra work and the toll it takes on her where during her youth under nasser she appears healthy happy and light this image drastically transforms after her marriage and the increasing pressures created under sadat conclusion social reproduction was always already part of the story of modern egypt from colonial notions of modern motherhood to anti colonial nationalist approaches to gender equality to free market utopias we have highlighted why a social reproductive approach that takes empire and colonialism seriously is productive rather than conceptualise this as a theoretical argument we see it as the beginnings of a research agenda in a context such as egypt considering what it would mean to think about social reproduction in the postcolony through multiple structural inequalities we have focused here on the 1950s 80s but it is worth mentioning that changing economic patterns throughout the 1990s and 2000s were also intimately linked to changes in social reproduction the turn towards hiring foreign domestic labour the increased ostentatiousness of egypt s upper middle and upper class and the increased presence of cultural traits as part of the domestic labour market are all symptomatic of a deepening economic crisis in egypt at the hands of deepening neoliberalisation the individualisation of economic traits and the increased tendency to represent and sell labour based on characteristics it possesses in this case cultural characteristics represents a particular phase of late capitalism following on from scholarly work that has highlighted the ways in which culture comes to stand in for race it is pertinent to pay closer attention to the mobilisation of culture in the creation of hierarchies in the labour market in egypt this has manifested in the creation of a marketplace of domestic labour in which there exists a hierarchy that positions women according to their country of origin ideas about which countries produce the best domestic workers or the most hardworking nannies can be seen as producing very material effects in terms of hiring practices and the production of a racialised marketplace this builds on an increasingly large field within critical feminist development studies that looks at race migration the international division of labour and social reproduction through tracing realities such as the global care chain feminist development scholars have shown that race and location are embedded within social reproduction at a global scale material and ideational movement is part and parcel of these chains as who is seen as valuable on the domestic worker market often determines migration patterns this is so to the extent that countries such as the philippines soon began to represent themselves as providing the best quality domestic workers in order to become competitive internationally notions of race work and gender therefore come together explicitly and implicitly when we think of migration and domestic work in our contemporary moment contemporary egypt and the widespread tendency among a certain social class to displace its reproductive burden on to foreign domestic workers remains an understudied development that can also shed light on the coming together of social reproduction gender empire race and capital returning to the question if labour produces the commodity who produces labour we suggest that the answer is never simply women processes of race empire and class constantly complicate the multiple power relations embedded within social reproduction colonisation and the imf world bank structural adjustment programmes both increased the social reproductive burden of women but of which women moreover these processes also often increase the social reproductive labour of men a point sometimes missed in the process of gendering social reproductive work as claudia jones has shown us capitalist exploitation is already racialised and gendered women of colour face a different set of economic political and social problems because of this addressing the imbalances of social reproduction then means thinking through the intersections of multiple structures from patriarchy and capitalism to imperialism and racism

the call over to greg greg trepp president and chief executive officer thank you lou anne good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call my remarks will cover the first quarter performance of our two business segments hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection as most of you know both businesses are seasonal the majority of the revenue and operating profit is typically earned in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday selling season the first quarter is the smallest of the year and the first half is the smallest half but first quarter results were only slightly behind our expectations and we expect the first half to be in line with our previous outlook at hamilton beach brands revenue for the first quarter was 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million last year revenue growth in the u s consumer market was partially offset by decreases in some of the international consumer markets global commercial revenue was comparable to last year unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced revenue by 700 000 as the canadian dollar and mexican peso weakened against the u s dollar progress with our strategic initiatives continued to drive growth in new areas in the u s e commerce channel initiatives we put into place to address the challenges we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 were beneficial and e commerce sales increased significantly in the first quarter compared to last year sales increased for our only the best products which are sold under the weston and hamilton beach professional brands and the license to wolf gourmet and chi brands driven in part by a number of new products launched for each brand in 2018 gross profit margin decreased to 20 7 from 22 1 last year primarily due to higher spot ocean freight rates on routes from china to the u s as importers accelerated container deliveries ahead of impending tariff increases while we were prepared for the impact of tariffs and expected some level of container cost increases the size of the increase during our peak shipping period was difficult to offset we expect our full year 2019 gross margin percent will be comparable to 2018 and we expect sequential improvement in each of the remaining quarters this year operating profit was 1 6 million compared to eight 3 8 million last year primarily due to the higher freight costs and to increased sg a expenses for the legal and professional fees including patent litigation expense next i d like to provide additional details regarding the important progress we continue to make with our key long term growth drivers new product platforms introduced in 2018 90 in all will benefit us in 2019 and beyond this year we are introducing a similarly strong line up of new products including a full line of air fryers and pressure cookers and we expect to gain share in these new fast growing categories in the first quarter the hamilton beach brand continued to hold the no 1 unit share position in the u s small kitchen appliance industry in both brick and mortar and e commerce channels each of the only the best brands generated double digit growth last year and all of them benefited from new product introductions and expanded retail distribution which we expect will benefit us this year and beyond we re introducing additional new products this year including a wolf gourmet stand mixer a weston electric food mill and sous vide circulator two hamilton beach professional hand mixers and new chi irons we expect growth from each of the brands continued distribution channel expansion and growth and share growth in stores and online global e commerce continues to grow for small kitchen appliances success in this channel requires providing products at the right price strong ratings and reviews and meaningful engagement with online shoppers our objective is to grow faster than the e commerce rate in each market where we compete we continue to focus on providing best in class retailer support increasing engagement with end users and enhancing programs designed to make us the preferred partner globally our products generally earn online ratings of four stars and above and favorable reviews in 2019 we expect e commerce sales growth in all markets in our global commercial business we have experienced strong growth across the americas europe and asia in the past few years we expect that broader distribution of several newer products will generate incremental revenue in the coming years increasingly the e commerce channel is becoming more significant in the commercial marketplace for both food service and hospitality purchase decision makers in those markets are using the internet more each day to both research products and purchase products we ve invested in a leading way to provide a digital marketing platform while maintaining our presence in traditional channels in international markets we plan to continue to expand in canada and mexico as well as latin america brazil and china where we have full teams in place we re finalizing plans to enter the india market with a soft launch in the second quarter we continue to evaluate additional markets through direct participation or brand licensing revenue in all the international markets in which we participate is expected to grow in 2019 we believe that our leadership in satisfying unmet consumer needs will enable us to continue to excel at providing products that are specifically designed to meet unique consumer needs in particular global markets examples of such items include a removable reservoir iron for the consumers in brazil the hamilton beach professional high performance blender for consumers in china and the hamilton beach professional juicer mixer grinder for consumers in india we launched new products in new categories outside of the traditional kitchen appliances in 2017 and 2018 including compact refrigerators coffee airpots knife sharpeners laundry accessories kitchen and bathroom scales among others revenue from new categories is expected to grow in 2019 as we introduce more products and gain traction the e commerce channel in particular enables us to introduce new products quickly and relatively inexpensively and react on a timely basis to consumer responses to new offerings we re excited about the progress we are making toward our long term growth objectives of reaching 750 million to 1 billion in annual revenue and 9 to 10 operating profit margin over time our initiatives provide many paths to reaching our revenue goals while some of our initiatives are delivering faster growth than others all of them have shown momentum and we will build upon them in the coming years next i will discuss the kitchen collection segment in 2018 and in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection continued to make solid progress with initiatives to return to profitability by closing underperforming stores moving all stores to a one year lease term maintaining gross margins reducing expenses and managing working capital at the end of 2018 kitchen collection had 189 stores in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection closed 21 stores and currently plans to close an additional 10 stores by the end of the year with the majority of the closures occurring in the second quarter by the end of 2019 kitchen collection expects to have 158 stores at that time 85 of the stores will have a lease term of approximately one year greatly increasing operating flexibility to respond to low store profitability levels kitchen collection believes it can rightsize its store portfolio aggressively over the next year or two with a core group of 100 to 150 adequately profitable stores in favorable outlet mall locations store lease decisions will be based on store by store profitability in the first quarter kitchen collection generated revenue of 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million last year the decrease was due to the closure of underperforming stores and lower comparable store sales both of which reflected a continued downward trend in customer traffic while the gross margin rate was down from last year given the number of stores we closed in the quarter we believe kitchen collection delivered a very good performance in gross margin percent we expect the full year gross margin to be in line with 2018 kitchen collection reduced its operating loss compared to last year the operating loss was 3 7 million an improvement of 600 000 compared to the operating loss of 4 3 million last year as a result of store closures and corporate expense reductions kitchen collection reduced operating expenses by 2 2 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 as most of you know kitchen collection typically has a loss in the early quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the business so in the first half our goal is to reduce the loss versus the prior year as we execute our strategy and the team accomplished that even with a large number of stores closing we offset the cost of closing which includes things like severance clearance promotions travel costs to and from the stores etc we re encouraging we re encouraged that kitchen collection is on track with the strategy we have been communicating and that its performance is improving as always if foot traffic to the malls is in line with our expectations as it was in the first quarter then we should be able to lever our improved performance if foot traffic improves or declines meaningfully kitchen collection s performance will likely follow with that overview of our two segments i ll turn the call over to michelle who will discuss our consolidated results michelle mosier vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you greg and good morning everyone my comments will focus first on our consolidated results for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year since greg has already reviewed our two segments in detail my comments will be mostly high level after discussing our consolidated first quarter results i will discuss our outlook for 2019 consolidated revenue was 145 4 million compared to 146 6 million last year at hamilton beach brands revenue increased to 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million at kitchen collection revenue decreased to 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million consolidated gross profit was 34 7 million compared to 37 8 million last year as a percentage of revenue gross profit was 23 9 compared to 25 8 as greg said we expect full year gross profit margin in both segments to be comparable to 2018 consolidated selling general and administrative expenses were 36 5 million compared to 38 million last year the decrease was primarily due to expense reductions in kitchen collection partially offset by increased legal and professional service fees at hbb the consolidated operating loss was 2 1 million compared to an operating loss of 500 000 last year operating profit at hamilton beach brands was offset by an operating loss at kitchen collection consolidated net interest expense was 746 000 compared to 532 000 last year the increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding under hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection s revolving credit facility and higher average interest rate we recognize an income tax benefit of 800 000 on a loss before income taxes of 2 5 million an effective tax rate of 30 8 the effective tax rate increased from 25 9 for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to an insignificant one time tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to our non u s pension plan consolidated net loss was 1 8 million or 0 13 per diluted share compared to a consolidated net loss of 400 000 or 0 03 per diluted share for 2018 next i ll discuss cash flow consolidated use of cash before financing activities was 100 excuse me 51 million compared to 41 5 million last year at both segments efforts to lower inventory were successful however the benefit was more than offset by a change in accounts payable due to the timing of payments capital expenditures were 900 000 compared to 2 4 million last year the decrease was primarily due to lower capital spending related to hamilton beach brands software development costs total cash expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately 4 5 million at hamilton beach brands and 300 000 at kitchen collection the remaining planned capital expenditures are primarily for the development of our erp system and tooling for new products at hamilton beach brands the company had cash on hand of 1 7 million compared to 2 4 million last year debt was 94 2 million compared to 85 5 million the higher debt level was due to fund was used to fund working capital at hamilton beach brands we re focused on getting our inventory cash flow and debt back to our desired level with inventory being the key element given the large volume in the fourth quarter traditionally the post holiday period brings large swings in working capital between the first and second quarters inventory in the first quarter was down meaningfully compared to the 2018 first quarter and we expect that trend to continue we continue to work to improve our dso and dpo and now let me turn to our outlook hamilton beach brands expects its 2019 revenue to grow moderately as a result of the continued successful implementation of its strategic initiatives including new customer new consumer and commercial product introduction only the best placements and continued expansion in the e commerce channel and international markets revenue for each of the strategic initiatives is expected to be above 2018 full year operating profit is currently expected to increase moderately over 2018 including a decrease in the first half of the year and an increase in the second half of the year compared to 2018 the second half outlook may change as customer commitments for the fall holiday selling season are confirmed in the second and third quarters while it s too early to confirm the final picture we have encountered new unfavorable issues that will pull our outlook down hamilton beach brands expects cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 kitchen collection expects its full future performance to be closely aligned with customer traffic trends including any potential improvements or further declines for 2019 kitchen collection s revenue is expected to decrease compared to 2018 as a result of store closures and low comparable store sales as a result of progress with its initiatives to return to profitability including significant expense reduction kitchen collection expects its operating loss and use of cash before financing activities in 2019 to improve if customer traffic to stores is line with expectations as it was in the first quarter kitchen collection expects to be able to deliver its anticipated improved performance based on the outlooks for the hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection segments hamilton beach brands holding company expects 2019 net income to increase and cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly over 2018 that concludes our prepared remarks we ll now turn the line back to the operator for q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of peter benedict from baird your line is open peter benedict baird analyst hey guys good morning i guess a couple of questions first just on the new categories you talked about the air fryers and pressure cookers coming just curious the timing when we should expect to see these in the market and is there any way to frame maybe the size of these categories relative to the broader market that s my first question scott tidey senior vice president north america sales and marketing hey peter this is scott we have talked about air fryers we currently have two air fryers in the market today one under proctor silex and one under hamilton beach and we ve got three more that are coming in the third quarter so we ve got two different sizes out there right now i think a one and a half and a two and a half liter with some larger capacities coming in the back half of the year and we continue to see that category grow also to go after that category we see that we think that business will transfer a little bit into the air fry and oven category and so we also work on new product development for that space as well for the pressure cookers we ve got two pressure cookers coming out one in the second quarter late in the second quarter and one in the third quarter so again a couple of platforms there that we ll be able to go after that size of business that category has slowed down a little bit but we do feel like that there s a good opportunity for us to come out with the two products that we have we think we re priced competitively and we ll be able to get some decent distribution in the marketplace peter benedict baird analyst ok good that s helpful the next one is just around in a private label which i know i think in the past you guys has been a big focus or even in this category necessarily but just curious i mean a lot of retailers working aggressively around private brands across their store curious kind of where you guys where your thought process is around private label maybe remind us what you ve done in the past and just how you re thinking about it going forward is it anything that s part of the plans that we should be thinking about greg trepp president and chief executive officer so we this is greg so private label has been a part of small appliances for a long time and sort of it s a little different than some other categories and mainly because once you put a plug on something there are safety issues there are performance issues you need a product that cooks properly or works properly and then certainly making sure you re understanding consumer needs and coming up with products that meet those needs so what we sort of found is that the in the small appliance business our private label will fluctuate between the low single digits i m sorry low double digits to maybe 15 to 20 of the market but it has not pushed up past that in the past so we assume that will continue to be the case we definitely have participated with retailers in the past and we currently do work with retailers in some areas on brands that are protected brands for them we have some meaningful business with some retailers so for us it s certainly a part of our portfolio it s one of the services we want to provide but generally speaking if it stays in that 10 to 15 range we won t find a role for ourselves in a lot of the businesses given the cost structure that the retailers need so my our belief is that it will sort be something that we participate in but not tried here at least in the near term peter benedict baird analyst ok that s helpful greg so you re not seeing just like a notable change in some of your customers desire to kind of to build out private brands further is that fair greg trepp president and chief executive officer that is fair yes we definitely many of our retail partners want a private label business as part of their portfolio for sure but that s sort of been the case for a long time so we don t see it changing in any way that s changing the whole industry scott tidey senior vice president north america sales and marketing and peter this is scott i do think we see some retailers are looking for more exclusive items so we will create an item that might be for one particular retailer and have a different feature set or different for different retailers so there could be exclusives but it would be under our brand and not under a private label brand name peter benedict baird analyst ok that s makes sense scott and then my last question just on the revenue outlook within hb i mean you re saying grow moderately now i think you were saying increase modestly my sense is that s an incrementally favorable comment but just wanted to clarify that and then just how do you think your 19 revenue plan compares to just the overall industry what is there anything going on from an industry standpoint that s noteworthy in terms of what you guys are seeing or expecting for growth in 2019 thank you greg trepp president and chief executive officer sure so for the full year i think where we are right now with worrying about customer decisions and watching other markets going i think we kind of feel pretty much in line with what we talked about in the past so any small changes in wording has not been intentional for the full year view of things but so we think we re from what we know now we think we re in a position to grow as we learn more about placements and promotional support we ll adjust that outlook moving forward in the overall market i think what we ve seen is we ve done particularly well in a number of categories that we ve been in traditionally when you if you put pressure cookers and air fryers aside we ve held up very well and adjust to things like e commerce and things but we certainly are very focused on also entering that fast growing part of the market to participate there and that ties into the products scott brought up so for pressure cookers and multi cookers as they finished the year last year still very strong very big big share of business that to scott s point they are still growing and the growth has slowed noticeably however it s been a quarter or two not i think could sort of pick back up who knows certainly very popular products it s not rolling over it s not tanking so i think if the these fast growing categories all sort of flatten out maybe grow a little bit maybe decline a little bit we don t expect them to go through the roof again or tank but they sort of stay modestly growing and modestly declining yeah they could well i think will be in a position to keep up with the market and hopefully beat the trend if pressure cookers were to roll over in a big way because we the silver lining for not participating in that growth would have been that it wouldn t hurt us as it came down so we would probably be ahead of the market but i say as we stand right now we re assuming that it s going to sort of soften to a lower growth rate and our goal is to grow a little faster than the overall market peter benedict baird analyst ok fair enough all right thanks guys appreciate it greg trepp president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mitchell lolley from nixon capital your line is open mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst hi i was just wondering first if you guys could give a little bit more color on the accounts payable timing shift issue in the quarter greg trepp president and chief executive officer sure as you go into mitchell this is greg as you go into the through the holiday season each year we have between we order in our inventory we have depending on the time of the inventory sometimes the retailer will have a big event in september october november depends on which ones we win sometimes they ll do direct import perhaps they will do through our warehouse system so that affects when we buy it therefore our payables are when we receive it and it s such a big part of the year that as that flows through the fourth quarter it impacts when all those elements the working capital are coming to fruition during first quarter second quarter and a lot of times this spills over into early second quarter so as we look forward we feel like we ve made good improvement on our inventory as michelle said and then as the payables work through the based on again the timing that we experienced in the fourth quarter it really will just sort of roll off naturally in the second quarter and be in line with what we thought so really we naturally have a late first quarter second quarter movement of some of these things receivables and payables and i think we re sort of at a little point here where it moved a little bit on us but it s just timing more than anything else mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst ok and then another question i had is i noticed that operating losses at kitchen collection were almost they re about 14 15 lower year over year is that a pace of year over year improvement in operating losses that you think could hold for the rest of the year greg trepp president and chief executive officer well we don t give specific guidance in that front but last year was a performance we were not happy with and we ve the things we ve talked about doing closing stores and holding our margin in line and all those getting out of stores that are causing a loss we have a lot of that hard work coming to fruition this year so our really with foot traffic being the big wild card we could see continued positive improvement versus the loss all year long if the foot traffic as we said earlier gets better or gets worse it s going to change it pretty fast but we ve assumed some level of foot traffic decline and our goal is to keep working margin expenses etc to make sure we improve in 2019 over 2018 mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst you just mentioned that changes in foot traffic can have a pretty dramatic and quick increase on the results and that leads me to kind of my broader question which is why is it a good strategy in general to continue dragging around a money losing asset that will never earn its cost of capital greg trepp president and chief executive officer well we ve talked in some of the past calls that we look at our business from a long term shareholder value improvement point of view and so as we look at all of our portfolio whether it s parts of the hamilton beach business or the kitchen collection business we re going to come up we re going to work a strategy that allows us to improve shareholder value over time so as we work to improve kitchen collection we could take steps today that would provide some short term news but wouldn t be the most shareholder friendly way to make the business move to a different place so what i will say is that we are being very focused and very deliberate and very strategic but also very cold about the steps we ve got to take to move both hb and kc to a better place and so our view is that we got to keep working at this year and getting it to a much better place so i think we don t view it as we re dragging things around but we definitely know that we need to get that business and our whole business to a better place to help increase shareholder value operator there are no more questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters greg trepp president and chief executive officer ok thank you and just a few last comments so we are excited about the prospects for advancing our strategic initiatives in our hamilton beach brands segment and for making further progress with our strategy to rightsize our kitchen collection store portfolio as we ve communicated our company takes a long term view and we are committed to building shareholder value over the long term we remain focused on the innovation initiatives and investments that are needed for the long term success of the business and before signing off i d like to note that in june we are participating in the baird consumer technology and services conference in new york our presentation is scheduled for wednesday june 5 at 3 10 p m and we hope to see

company reported assets under management or aum increased nearly 2 billion to a record 675 billion excluding the impacts of foreign currency exchange and operations acquired and disposed during the trailing 12 months aum would have increased by 29 billion or 4 on a sequential basis aum increased 49 billion or 8 asset appreciations added 43 billion to aum in the first quarter more than offsetting the 34 billion drop in the fourth quarter from unfavorable market performance we have also increased aum in our joint venture in china to a record 158 billion in the first quarter this is an increase of 14 billion or 10 compared to a year ago despite a negative 8 billion impact from foreign currency exchange as a reminder china is not included in our reported aum as further color on our asset management franchise we again received some noteworthy third party recognition during the quarter including multiple best fund awards from lipper additionally at the asia asset management 2019 best of

and 66 above median for the three year performance we delivered 12 percentage point and 14 percentage point improvements respectively compared to year end 2018 these gains reflect a rebound in our international equity strategies which is discussed at the fourth quarter call we are also dampening performance of our target date solutions given our focus on long term strategies it s important for us to maintain conviction and our investment process it s reassuring when performance recovers after short downturns moving to total company net cash flow we delivered a positive 5 5 billion in the first quarter relative to outflows in the sequential and prior year quarters ris delivered 4 1 billion of net cash flow its fifth consecutive positive quarter and a second best quarter on record this was driven by record sales strong retention and reoccurring deposit growth in risp and ris spread sales increased 1 2 billion or 139 compared to the year ago quarter principal international generated 800 million of net cash flow it s 42nd consecutive positive quarter and 1 7 billion of positive net cash flow from our joint venture in china that is not included in reported net cash flow pgi source net cash flow turned positive in the quarter and nearly 300 million after five consecutive quarters of net outflows first quarter was the best net cash flow quarter for our us retail mutual fund business in more than two years as we ve discussed on prior calls we have approximately 3 billion in the at risk investment grade bond strategy with a single international client in pgi due to high currency hedging cost we expect clients to withdraw the entire amount over the course of the second quarter we continue to manage other assets with this client and other strategies where hedging cost can be more easily absorbed the client continues to award us additional mandates reflecting the ongoing strength of the relationship as we re all aware the asset management industry and pgi continues to experience pressure including increased demand for lower cost investment options and volatility in capital markets we re pleased with our headway on multiple fronts to address these industry pressures we re starting to see benefits emerge from restructuring our distribution teams we continue to add key resources and we re building our business intelligence to help inform our sales process positioning us for increasing success in key institutional retail markets other progress in the first quarter included the launch of more than a dozen new investment strategies across our us and international platforms with the vast majority in latin america and asia i m particularly encouraged by the continued collaboration between pgi and principal international in these markets we also launched the principal guaranteed option during the first quarter expanding our line up of fixed income investment solutions for retirement plans this new option offers a compelling crediting rate and seeks to preserve capital and support performance through deferring market cycles it s also portable customers can maintain their investment even if the plan moves to a new record keeper as a notable etf development we created a guided approach to factor investing to help customers achieve their unique goals we partnered with nasdaq dorsey wright for the first time to launch the principal ndw factor rotation model portfolio we also earned nearly 30 total placements in the first quarter with more than 20 different offerings on 16 different platforms this reflects our continued success getting our investment options added to third party distribution platforms recommended list and model portfolios more broadly we continue to see strong interest in our specialty solution oriented and alternative investment capabilities as we help clients diversify build wealth generate income protect against downside risk and address inflation i ll now share some key execution highlights starting with our planned acquisition of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business as of year end 2018 this business had more than 825 billion of assets under administration across several retirement and non retirement products including defined contribution defined benefit non qualified executive benefits institutional trust in custody and institutional asset advisory this doubled our footprint of our us retirement business increasing our retirement assets to over 500 billion and will serve a combined 7 5 million participants making us a top three retirement plan provider given the current competitive environment it could have taken us more than a decade to grow participants to this level organically beyond adding scale to our retirement businesses the addition of the non retirement trust in custody offering add to diversifying revenue source importantly the acquisition is expected to generate 425 million of run rate revenue of principal once fully integrated in 2022 the acquisition is clearly strategic further enabling us to capitalize on one of the largest opportunities in financial services the us retirement savings and retirement income markets this acquisition will solidify our leadership and enhance our position in pension reform discussions around the world we look forward to serving our new customers and working with new employees and new advisors as part of our accelerated digital investments we launched simple invest during the quarter our first product with robustwealth the solution introduces robo advisor services for retirement savings and retirement income while we ve provided education and guidance to our customers for many years this is our first foray into digital advice for our us retirement business initially we re focusing on participants who are retiring or changing jobs where we are the planned provider it is designed for participants who don t have an advisor or prefer to do it themselves over the long term the addition of wells fargo institutional retirement business only magnifies the potential opportunity we recently became the first retirement plan provider to offer voice activated financial wellness and retirement readiness education with our february launch of a weekly principal flash briefing through amazon alexa we launched a new onboarding experience for retirement plan participants last november nearly 70 000 people used the tool in the first quarter early results show that we are improving retirement outcomes average deferral rate exceeded 7 with more than one in four participants at 10 or higher and at 26 of the take up of the automatic savings increase is twice the rate of our existing block of participants in our protection businesses we continue to invest in initiatives that make us easier to do business with our specialty benefits call center chatbot is now giving dental providers more convenient access to answers while reducing call volume we ve also debuted e delivery of our term life insurance policies enhancing experience for both the customer and the advisor dan will cover this in more detail but i want to emphasize our balanced approach to capital deployment in addition to ongoing investments in organic growth strategic acquisitions and our accelerated investment in digital business strategies we continue to return capital to shareholders in the first quarter we returned 280 million to investors through common stock dividends and share buybacks bringing our trailing 12 month total to more than 1 2 billion i will also share some additional recognition for the quarter forbes named principal one of america s best employers for diversity for the fourth consecutive year principal earned a perfect score on the human rights campaign corporate equality index making us one of hrc s best place to work for lgbt equality for the ninth time ethisphere institute named principal as one of the world s most ethical companies and for the 18th time the national association for female executive named principal one of the top companies for executive women this speaks volumes about who we are as a company and why we re going to be successful long term in closing again first quarter was a good start to the year for principal we continue to make steady progress in helping customers and clients achieved financial security i expect us to build additional momentum throughout 2019 and for that to translate into long term value for shareholders and each of our stakeholders deanna speaker c deanna d strable thanks dan good morning and thank you for participating on our call today i ll discuss key contributors to our first quarter financial results and i ll provide an update on capital deployment the first quarter was a good start to 2019 with net income attributable to principal of 430 million an increase of 8 from the prior year quarter non gaap operating earnings were 400 million or a 1 43 per diluted share in the first quarter eps increased 2 compared to a very strong first quarter of 2018 our non gaap operating earnings effective tax rate was 16 4 for the first quarter at the lower end of our 2019 guided range of 16 to 20 roe excluding aoci other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 13 4 on a reported basis as a result of favorable macroeconomic conditions we had three significant variances during first quarter with a positive 33 million benefit to reported non gaap pre tax operating earnings the significant variances included 15 million of lower dac amortization and ris fee due to the point to point increase in the equity markets 13 million of higher than expected encaje performance in principal international and a 5 million benefit from the net impact of inflation in latin america also in principal international excluding significant variances in both periods total company non gaap operating earnings of 376 million increased 6 from fourth quarter of 2018 but decreased 10 from the very strong year ago quarter looking at macroeconomics equity markets started the year strong with a 13 increase in the s p 500 index during the quarter despite this the daily average increased only 1 compared to fourth quarter and decreased slightly from the year ago quarter as there was only a slight increase in the daily average revenue and earnings did not receive much of a benefit from the positive market performance in the quarter foreign currency exchange rates created a headwind of 10 million for principal international s pre tax operating earnings relative to the prior year quarter but were a slight benefit compared to fourth quarter of 2018 mortality and morbidity experience for ris spread and specialty benefits we are in line with our expectations but less favorable than first quarter of 2018 seasonality impacts our first quarter results in both pgi and specialty benefits as expected pgi had higher compensation costs in the first quarter that said pgi s total operating expenses were lower than a typical first quarter also as expected specialty benefits experienced higher dental and vision claims and higher sales related expenses in the first quarter as a reminder first quarter 2018 benefited from an extremely low and unsustainable individual disability loss ratio we expect annual earnings and specialty benefits to emerge approximately 45 in the first half of the year and 55 in the second half of the year with the seasonality concentrated in the first quarter the following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods on a trailing 12 month basis excluding the annual actuarial review and encaje performance pre tax margins for all business units were within or above the 2019 guided ranges expenses continue to be well managed even with our accelerated digital on investments and other ongoing investments in the businesses pretax operating earnings for all businesses with the exception of corporate were in line with or better than our expectations for the quarter ris fees underlying business fundamentals continue to be strong compared to the year ago quarter sales were up 30 to a record 5 4 billion recurring deposits grew 9 with a 11 increase in deferrals and a 14 increase in employer matches defined contribution plan count increased more than 3 or over 1 200 plans and defined contribution participant account increased 9 with nearly 300 000 net new participants during the quarter ris spread had 2 1 billion of sales more than double the prior year quarter fixed annuity sales were 800 million and we had record first quarter pension risk transfer sales of 600 million the pipeline for pension risk transfer sales remained strong for 2019 us insurance solutions also started the year with strong sales including record sales in specialty benefits we continue to grow and deepen relationships with customers as we increased lines of coverage in our group benefits block by 13 from the prior year period pgi s pre tax operating earnings declined 11 from the prior year period to 101 million this was primarily due to lower fee revenue due to a decline in average aum resulting from muted market performance negative net cash flow and operations acquired and disposed over the trailing 12 months at 84 million corporate pre tax operating losses were higher than our expected run rate due to normal quarterly volatility in expenses for full year we do anticipate corporate losses to be above the high end of our 2019 guided range of 300 million to 320 million this is primarily due to the impact of the planned acquisition of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business and higher security benefit expenses due to the market decline at the end of 2018 after we close the acquisition we will have transaction costs and additional interest expense from our new debt issuance as well as lower investment income from using available capital to finance a portion of the acquisition as shown on slide 12 we deployed 280 million of capital during the quarter including a 150 million in common stock dividends and 130 million in share repurchases we expect to deploy well above our 1 billion to 1 4 billion capital deployment range in 2019 after taking into consideration the 1 2 billion that we committed in april for the planned acquisition of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business we anticipate the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating our reporting structure and financial supplement to best reflect the combined organization as shared on the acquisition announcement call we have suspended share repurchases and expect to resume no later than first quarter of 2020 last night we announced a 0 54 common stock dividend payable in the second quarter a 4 increase from a year ago on a trailing 12 month basis we have approximately a 4 dividend yield and we re at our targeted 40 net income payout ratio during the quarter we made the decision to lower our long term naic risk based capital target by 20 percentage points with the midpoint of our range now at 400 as a reminder at year end 2018 our rbc ratio was reduced by 45 percentage points as a result of a change to the naic formula associated with us tax reform our capital and liquidity positions remain very strong at the end of the first quarter we had 1 1 billion of available capital in the holding company 400 million of available cash in our subsidiaries and 200 million of capital in excess of our new rbc midpoint of 400 the financial flexibility we ve created allows us to execute the wells fargo transaction without compromising our liquidity and leverage targets we have no meaningful debt maturities until 2022 and our leverage ratio is expected to remain within our 20 to 25 targeted range whether through strategic acquisitions organic growth or investing in our businesses we continue to prioritize investments that position principal for long term success this concludes our prepared remarks operator please open the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question will come from humphrey lee with dowling partners please go ahead humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question for renee regarding ris fees flows obviously were very good in the quarter transfer and recurring deposits were strong but one thing that is notable is that escrows ph came down meaningfully compared to the past couple of quarters can you talk about the driver for the improvement and kind of what you think about the net flows pictures for the balance of the year daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes humphrey thanks for the question it really was a great quarter for ris full service and renee is in an ideal position to respond to your question renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions thank you humphrey yes you re correct if you do look at our withdrawals for first quarter of 2019 they are favorable and if you were to dissect that a little bit further you would see that our planned sponsor or the contract withdrawals in particular were very favorable one thing to note though is as you make a quarter over one year ago quarter comparison we did have a relatively large plan withdrawal in first quarter of 2018 so that that needs to be taken excuse me third quarter excuse me first quarter pardon me and so that would have to be taken into consideration as well but it was a very good net cash flow quarter overall humphrey lee dowling partners analyst i guess are you doing anything different in terms of client retention or anything like that that helps to see the more favorable withdrawal activities renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions i would say humphrey that if you were to look at our overall model we continue to invest in the customer experience and you see this in several different ways we ve made consistent digital investments into creating new tools that would make both the planned sponsor and the participant experience better so from a planned sponsor perspective for example investing into chat features investing into new tools that would allow the planned sponsor to better serve their participants using online capabilities certainly lead to a better experience and better retention and the same thing is true in the participants side so i would say that the favorable retention results that you see here reflect a very strong underlying business model daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes the only thing i might add humphrey to that impressive list of things that renee and her team are doing is if i look at it still 50 of the sales are total retirement suite they find great value in combining deferred comp defined benefit and defined contribution also i think that the new tool that was rolled out within the last six months called picture that allows our sales reps to be more fluid in their sales presentations to prospective clients and advisors very positive feedback from the market and then also noteworthy 12 increase in the number of new advisors we are working with in this current period so i think across every one of the important metrics around leveraging technology in our position with our alliance partners where we ve got good momentum so thanks for the question humphrey humphrey lee dowling partners analyst appreciate the color just a follow up on pgi so you ve talked about the 3 billion outflows can you size and i understand they have very low fees but i was just wondering can you size the earnings impact from that outflows and then on the flip side the new mandate that you re getting from the same clients do you expect that to offset the earnings impact from the 3 billion outflow daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer amy got a quick response amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions sure thanks for the question humphrey i think as we talked before this is a good relationship with a really good client we continue to see interest in higher value added strategies that fit well with the hedging cost that they re seeing today we don t quantify exactly how much we re losing in terms of the fees related to the 3 billion but i would say the new mandate goes a fair way to replacing that revenue daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks for the question humphrey humphrey lee dowling partners analyst thank you operator the next question will come from erik bass with autonomous research please go ahead erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you for ris fee looking at the adjusted return on net revenue ex favorable dac this quarter you re still at the high end of the guidance range for the year even though fee income was still dampened a bit by markets so just wondering if there is anything else that boosted results this quarter or do you think margins at the higher end of the range are sustainable going forward daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thank you for the question erik when we look at the 30 return on net revenue for first quarter we re not seeing anything unusual that would boost the results there and so when we look forward for the remainder of the year we think our guidance of 26 to 30 remains very appropriate daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks erik bass autonomous research analyst got it and then another question for our shifting to the spread side prt activity was strong both for you and it looks like across the industry in 1q i am curious what you think is driving this and does it suggest that we re on pace for just a really strong sales year or is it a pull forward of activity daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s a great question i will have renee answer it but i will say this it s been interesting to me as we ve seen these interest rates go up and sort of tested 3 25 knocking on the door 3 5 and they falling back i think again it just sort of wakes up these things are normally in process they are in motion they ve already sort of aligned their thoughts thinking they want to unload this liability from their balance sheet and frankly it not only was a good quarter but it s an incredibly strong pipeline for the balance of the year renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes erik just to give you a little bit of color about sales that we saw in first quarter we did see about a 600 million of pension risk transfer sales and this was not dominated by a single large sale this was really many smaller sales that are smaller sized transfers that fall comfortably within our sweet spot we do continue to see a very robust pipeline for prt and the other thing that i think is very interesting when you look at the industry there s about 3 trillion of defined benefit or pension corporate plans out there and it only a very small portion of that has been derisked from corporate balance sheets so i do think we ll continue to see strong pipelines moving forward we will also continue to be very careful and very disciplined as we look at these opportunities to make sure that the risk profile and that the returns are well within our comfort range daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer sure thanks for the questions erik bass autonomous research analyst thank you operator the next question is from alex scott with goldman sachs please go ahead alex scott goldman sachs analyst hi good morning first question i had was just on pgi on the fees i mean just looking at the fee rate quarter over quarter i mean doing a calculation it seems like it dropped more than it has sequentially for a while now so i d just be interested in any commentary was there any kind of repricing activity that maybe drove that does that have to do maybe just with fewer fee days or something like that i m just trying to get a feel for if there is more pressure there or if it s just something with the calculation daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer and certainly mix comes into that as well tim you want to go ahead and take that timothy m dunbar president principal global asset management sure so the fee rate did drop as you suggest for the first quarter here and i would say the large majority of that is related to transaction fees those are predominantly on commercial real estate so if you think about first quarter after the sort of volatile fourth quarter commercial mortgage loan activity got started off at a slower pace i would say that s picked up dramatically and we re seeing that come back so we don t see that being a long term issue throughout the year we also had a little bit less than what we would have seen in performance fees and then as you suggest there has been fee pressure in the industry and we ve continued to update our fee level but that s been and so you ve seen a little bit of that but that s been a much smaller component of it alex scott goldman sachs analyst got you that s helpful and then my follow up question is just on the corporate segment compensation and other came in a bit higher i guess can you dimension how much of that you expect to continue i mean is the 300 million to 320 million range for the full year still so a good way to think about it daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes it s a good question and one of course deanna is in a good position to respond to deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanks alex as i mentioned earlier on the call we do now expect to be above the guidance so really have a larger last two drivers of that one that was seen in the first quarter and one that will more play out toward the end of the year the one that was seen in the first quarter was that we did have higher security benefit pension expenses that was not known at the time of the outlook call it really gets determined really on 12 31 and due to the market decline that increased our gaap expense for the pension plan and that will continue as we go throughout the year the other driver in corporate will actually be due to the impact of the wells acquisition so we will have some one time transaction costs that will come into corporate we ll also have the additional financing costs due to our debt issuance and we ll also have some lost investment income due to lower excess capital as we fund that acquisition and so that will cause us to be above that original targeted range of 300 million to 320 million i would say that the first quarter loss is a good proxy absent the impact of the wells transaction but as you have seen in corporate for many many years this will obviously be very volatile quarter to quarter daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer appreciate the questions alex alex scott goldman sachs analyst thank you operator the next question is from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar j p morgan securities inc analyst hi good morning first i just had a question on asset management flows they obviously turned positive this quarter after i think five straight quarterly declines so does this have anything to do with any of the management changes or the initiatives that you ve been undertaking over the past year in the business or just if you could give some color on what drove this daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes we re excited about the change in direction and tim dunbar and pat halter i think have just done an extraordinarily outstanding job jimmy looking under the hood of pgi and understanding where some efficiencies and distribution could be gained and so there has been some realignment and i d also tell you that the group is highly motivated and excited about the leadership and with that i ll ask tim to fill in the blanks timothy m dunbar president principal global asset management hi jimmy thanks a lot for the question we have talked a lot about some of the management changes we ve made some of the structural changes and really trying to align the group with our clients and so really the focus has been in creating that long term relationship and bringing to bear all of the solutions that our diversified boutique model brings and so we are starting to see some positive signs of that placements on platforms of some of our products and really for this quarter one of the things i m probably most excited about is that the range of products we ve seen positive flows has really been something that we ve been trying to achieve so not only did we see some of our yield oriented products like deferreds high yields diversified real assets positive flows but even a lot of our equity products so reits blue chip which is our large cap us equity products really saw some decent flows equity income and small cap international so really across a broad range of capabilities and so we re optimistic about the future obviously second quarter we ll have some headwinds with a client that s leaving but for the second half of the year we still feel good about the net cash flows jimmy bhullar j p morgan securities inc analyst okay and then there is a lot of talk about new pension regulation secure act and how that affects smaller employers do you see that as more as an opportunity or is there a threat in there as well with the potential sort of better bargaining leverage on the part of smaller employers as they can combine to offer retirement plan daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer you know jimmy we spend a lot of time on this topic it s an important one not only important here in the us but there s a lot of pension regulation changes occurring around the world but the idea of the meps multiple employer plans we ve been in that business for a long time we understand exactly how to execute on that strategy and our vantage point is if it increases coverage and it increases adequacy for american workers we want to pursue that it s just good policy but i ll ask renee to add some additional color on how we re executing on that strategy renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions thank you jimmy as dan said we re very excited about the potential of what could evolve with pension reform in the united states and the open meps is just one of the aspects that we think will extend coverage to smaller employers but there is another aspect of this reform that i think is very important and we believe will serve americans well and that is better positioning the annuities to be a part of retirement plans moving forward as you know today it s not clear there s not a safe harbor plan design for planned sponsors to add the annuity option to inaudible defined contribution plan so we really believe that it s in the best interest of americans to have this kind of an income guarantee available to them moving forward and so we re excited not only about the open meps but also about the ability to provide that hire to retire solution to the us worker daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jimmy for your questions jimmy bhullar j p morgan securities inc analyst thank you thanks operator the next question will come from john barnidge with sandler o neill please go ahead daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer john you there john barnidge sandler o neill analyst sorry my phone was muted apologies daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer okay john barnidge sandler o neill analyst specialty benefits on increase in lapse rates for group life and incurred loss rates for group dental as compared to a year ago can you talk about what you re seeing there a little bit please daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes absolutely amy please go ahead amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions yes thanks for the question john i think what we re really getting at here is probably mostly a comparison issue i think deanna mentioned in her comments before but we typically see a lot of first quarter seasonality from our dental and vision line and last year first quarter we didn t see quite as much of that i would say we re back to normal seasonality for dental and vision for first quarter of this year for group disability in terms of the loss ratios first quarter last year was unusually low we had a lot of moving pieces happening first quarter of last year that kind of made things a little noisier product by product but i would say we re back to something at this point now that we feel like is indicative of a pretty good run rate so always a reminder to on loss ratios given the seasonality given the things that can happen quarter by quarter in these businesses trailing 12 month tends to be a good guideline to go back to daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer and well within the ranges amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions and then lapses yes did you have a lapse question as well john john barnidge sandler o neill analyst yes i did thanks amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions okay let me get at the lapse question then one of the things that will happen with the businesses from quarter to quarter is we can have larger cases that have some impact into our lapses and so when i look at group life group life for first quarter of this year was impacted by some larger case lapses keep in mind that as we look at the business we look at what rates we need we ask for rate increases against that business and when i look at our group life block we are increasing the profitability and performance of that block so i m comfortable with any lapses that happened first quarter john barnidge sandler o neill analyst great and then my follow up sticking with group a bit so really strong sales continued lot of the progress seen what are you seeing there on the pricing and competitive landscape and where you re maybe seeing demand come from thank you very much daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer please amy amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions right so the landscape is competitive but not irrational in the markets that we re in so keep in mind in the markets that we re in we re mostly in that small to medium sized marketplace so we don t tend to be in that larger and we don t tend to be in the jumbo case on the hunt for some of those jumbo cases and so when i look at the pricing we re able to typically get the type of price that we want on a really attractive growth rate i would come back to i think we do the fundamentals of the business really really well especially in the small market in fact i d argue in the small market we re probably one of the best total offerings out there in terms of total value daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer appreciate the questions john john barnidge sandler o neill analyst thank you operator the next question will come from ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods analyst hi thanks good morning i had a question on the wells retirement acquisition more strategic in the past principal typically seemed more cautious on the larger case record keeping business so i was hoping you could give some perspective on how and why your view on that has changed now daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes ryan thanks for that question i can t tell you how excited we are about welding the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business to principal for a lot of different reasons we actually as you have pointed out have focused on that small to medium with a modest amount of large plans and then if you looked at their block it really inserts nicely because we actually have more jumbo cases than wells fargo has so there is a little bit of a gap in our sort of total lineup so we re excited about what that fills additionally as was mentioned in the prepared comments the fact that they have this trust business it gives us some additional flexibilities i would also tell you that the fact that they have an esop program in place a non qualified structure in place it just fits like hand in glove in terms of our existing structure so other than size it is also additive and that they have historically worked with a group of advisors consultants that maybe weren t first top of mind for principal and given our strategy in terms of bringing over a large percentage of the relationship managers and the consultants relationship management teams et cetera we feel that we can really create a seamless transition for the advisors for the clients for the participants and just frankly add a whole lot more value and with that i realize i took quite a bit of time renee but would love to have you make some additional comments renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thank you yes i would agree with dan s comments this acquisition is really ideal from so many different perspectives first off it reinforces our commitment to the retirement industry and when you look traditionally at the capabilities that we ve brought to the marketplace from a record keeping perspective we serve a wide range of clients in terms of size in terms of makeup in terms of the various characteristics and needs and so having the ability to add scale to our record keeping platforms makes us that much more competitive the ability to lower the unit cost the ability to scale our platforms to allow us to remain competitive in the industry to continue to invest in this business and to deliver favorable margins the capabilities that we re adding in the large plan market are very attractive to us adding abilities in the consulting channel again is very important and the last thing that i ll mention is we also have access to a very experienced and talented employee pool and i can t stress that enough we had the opportunity this past week to invite about 100 of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust team members into des moines and i can t tell you the level of energy and enthusiasm that we had among the group and what struck me was the commonality that we all have in terms of keeping the customer at the center and making sure that everything that we do is customer centric and will advance our ability to serve both the plan sponsor and the participants in the years to come so we re very excited about this transition and the acquisition ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods analyst great thank you very much daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ryan appreciate it operator the next question will come from andrew kligerman with credit suisse please go ahead andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey good morning maybe just staying on ris fee for a bit just in terms of the fee levels maybe you could give a little guidance as to where you kind of see that going in the next year or two we kind of do a calculation we calculated 66 basis points of fees and other revenues divided by average assets in 17 and then it was 63 basis points last year and then we look at this quarter and it was about 58 basis points and i know that it has something to do with the average share of daily balances versus 59 basis points in prior quarter but maybe you could just give us a little color on where you see that going over the next one or two or three years daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer we will be happy to cover that renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions sure first off let s maybe take a look at what happened in first quarter and then i ll make some comments about what we might expect moving forward but when we look at first quarter and you compare that to a quarter one year ago the first thing to keep in mind is that the s p daily average was down about 0 5 and so that of course had a very that muted market performance had an impact on the year over year fee levels that you can expect for us to deliver and so a portion of that of the gaap there was about a 6 gaap year over year quarter over quarter rather so most of that again as a result of a very muted market performance the other thing that i would draw your attention to is when we and we mentioned this in our outlook call we anticipate seeing about 1 to 2 decline in fees as a result of commissions beginning to transfer to fees paid to advisors and what this does is it reduces the net revenue but it also reduces the commission line so that the impact to the pre tax operating earnings remains the same and the impact to the margin risk remains the same and just a quick commentary on that trend we view that very favorably it absolutely isolates the advisor compensation and makes that very visible to the plan sponsor and it removes it from a conversation that s necessary as we think about our fees with the plan sponsor so we would anticipate that kind of activity to continue so then looking forward historically you ve heard us talk about that 5 to 8 gaap between growth in account values and growth in net revenues and that s a result of the typical pressures within the industry on revenues that results from decoupling the record keeping decision from the investment management decision the open architecture reduction in investment management fees due to passive investing things of that nature we envision that that s a reasonable guideline moving forward so we would say you can expect to see about a 5 to 8 gap due to simple industry revenue pressures as well as maybe 1 to 2 shift due to commissions moving to a fee based compensation arrangement daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer andrew i think it also speaks to why we feel we have to have scale in these businesses for this very reason andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it and very helpful and then just the next question actually maybe i could just sneak a one liner before the next question but just the tax rate at 16 4 and deanna talked about 16 to 20 guidance can we expect the low end going forward and then just shifting over to just staying on pension risk transfer maybe talk about the level of competition in these smaller accounts you mentioned that the pricing is better than the jumbo but how many competitors do you see when you typically go after one of these smaller prts is it aggressive daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes let me take both of those i would say that the tax rate we still think it s going to be well within the range i wouldn t want to speculate at this point in time on a full year basis but when we look at the tax rate it s on the lower end but well within the range on the pension risk transfer business it really does break into two different groups large and small think about kind of below half a billion and greater than a half a billion and i would say in each case there s about a half a dozen key competitors we know who they are we know how they get to where they re at we re still getting what we consider to be a very nice return on invested capital in these lines of business there are a few more competitors today than there was two or three years ago and it is a competitive marketplace but we think we re getting more than adequately compensated for the use of the capital for this line of business and again very committed to it appreciate the question andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thank you operator the next question will come from thomas gallagher with evercore please go ahead thomas gallager evercore isi analyst good morning another follow up on ris fee so it looks like and it is going to be related to i guess the comment that you made about the 5 to 8 gaap in revenue growth versus asset growth but if i look at the disclosure that you have between plan sizes it looks to me like either all or a vast majority of your growth inflows is coming from 1 000 lives and larger plans if i just look at either planned growth or asset growth is that a fair characterization i mean in terms of the business that s a thousand lives in smaller are you actually seeing net outflows overall and can you talk a little bit about what the economic difference is if revenue fee yield for these large plans versus mid to small daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes we actually see good net cash flow in each of the market segments but i ll have renee speak specifically to your question tom renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thank you for the question tom when we look at the mix of business that we have between the larger plan and the smaller plan we re actually seeing good growth in both of these segments and certainly the retention of clients in both of these segments remains very positive in any one quarter we will tend to see sales migrate just naturally we ll see some volatility or some difference in the mix of the business that we sell so for example in the first quarter if you look at that record 5 4 billion of sales you will see that it is not dominated by any single large plan at all but there is a really nice mix of the mid sized plans and that will vary from quarter to quarter with respect to your question around the variation in the revenues that we would collect as you might imagine with smaller plans we tend to not only pickup the record keeping but oftentimes we pick up a share a larger share of the asset management as well and with the larger plans they tend to steer more toward open architecture and our ability to win or capture assets is certainly favorable in that size market but it s going to be less than what you see in the smaller plan market so we feel very comfortable with the business mix we feel very comfortable with our approach and our ability to deliver growth in both small and large plans and certainly our ability to retain that daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think the other thing worth noting tom on the asset retention part it s fairly indiscriminate on the relative size of the employer we have a really good shot at small medium and large individuals who are part of a plan and who are looking for advice that benefit even whether it s a job changer or a retiree thomas gallager evercore isi analyst got you and just a follow up on that can you break out in terms of flows how much of your flows if you could quantify of the i think it s what 3 4 billion of cash flows would have been 1 000 lives in larger versus below that size if you re able to quantify that daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer you know that s not something we re going to provide at this point but appreciate your comment thank you thomas gallager evercore isi analyst thanks operator the final question is from suneet kamath with citi please go ahead suneet kamath citi analyst thanks just want to circle back on the wells deal so in ris fee i think you spent a fair amount of money on digital over the past couple of years as you get to know the wells block any color on are you getting anything that you didn t have or there is going to be some incremental expenses that you re going to have to incur to get digital on those plans just any color there would be helpful daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes great question and as you might expect you get some of that doing due diligence but the real lift is starting as we speak to really fully understand some of the capabilities and what you might onboard to augment it is our promise and commitment to take best in class on all fronts with that renee do you want to add some additional color on specificity renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions sure when we think about the path forward and how we will integrate our businesses we ve really arrived at thinking about this in terms of four overarching principles and the first principle is to keep the customer clearly at the center and to make sure that we minimize any disruption in service that we do everything we can to provide business as usual and excellent service to those clients the second thing as dan mentioned we have the ideal opportunity to take the best from both operations and team and to put this together into an extremely compelling offering to the marketplace the next thing that we re very concerned about and we re paying a lot of attention to is talent we are picking up a very experienced team from the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to make their onboarding smooth as well and then last of all we don t view this as just an integration of business we view this as an opportunity to create unsurpassed value to the marketplace this is our opportunity to move the needle and so we ll approach this very thoughtfully very carefully and you can expect to hear a lot more on this as the months ahead unfold suneet kamath citi analyst got it makes sense and then my follow up is again on ris fee if i look at your disclosures it looks like the percentage of assets that are non proprietary is now slightly over a third of the mix and it s been the fastest growing piece based on your disclosure so i guess is that performance is that fee related is it active to passive and where does that i think it s about 33 5 today where does that do you think that goes over the next couple of years thanks daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes so maybe quickly on that one it hasn t part as renee described earlier a difference on the size of the plan sponsor and if you re skewing toward the larger and you re going to put downward pressure on the percentage of proprietary asset management the percentage of small medium and large they ve drifted slightly downward over the last few years but again it s our objective to be customer centric provide customers and advisors for what they are looking for there are multiple sources of revenue growth for principal in totality and so we continue to manage that but we will continue to be a customer centered in how we present our investment offerings the fees are competitive the performance is good a little bit of a hiccup in the q4 period but as i look at the relative strength of the investment performance on 1 3 and 5 that still puts us in a formidable position to attract a lot of assets the last thing i would say and you can t forget this we still capture a lot of assets through dcio it s where we re putting our investment options on our competitors platform and again that s been a growth engine for the company as well and those results are not shown in full service but rather within pgi so thank you for the question operator we have reached the end of our q a session mr houston your closing comments please daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer good thank you and again from our perspective good start to the year we do have multiple parallel paths of growth that we re executing on as we speak and we ve talked about this one is around the digitizing of our business and it does have some cost but that is starting to bear fruit and we re excited about what that s going to deliver we also remain very enthusiastic about successfully onboarding the wells fargo retirement trust customers and i emphasize both the retirement and the trust customers it s a big part of their franchise as well as putting us in a favorable position with their advisors and their clients and executing on that the third is around our operational excellence initiative a big undertaking for us here as we continue to be as efficient as we can in aligning our resources with the needs of our customers and then lastly as you would expect delivering outstanding customer service and again if you looked at all the growth initiatives for the first quarter there is a clear sign that there is a good value proposition for principal clients and so with that thank you for taking the time today and look forward to seeing you on the road thank you operator thank you for

tax rate compared to a year ago total company reported assets under management or aum increased nearly 2 billion to a record 675 billion excluding the impacts of foreign currency exchange and

aum in the first quarter more than offsetting the 34 billion drop in the fourth quarter from unfavorable market performance we have also increased aum in our joint venture in china to a record 158 billion in the first quarter this is an increase of 14 billion or 10 compared to a year ago despite a negative 8 billion impact from foreign currency exchange as a reminder china is not included in our reported aum as further color on our asset management franchise we again received some noteworthy third party recognition during the quarter including multiple best fund awards from lipper

performance at 53 above median for the one year performance and 66 above median for the three year performance we delivered 12 percentage point and 14 percentage point improvements respectively compared to year end 2018 these gains reflect a rebound in our international equity strategies which is discussed at the fourth quarter call we are also dampening performance of our target date solutions given our focus on long term strategies it s important for us to maintain conviction and our investment process it s reassuring when performance recovers after short downturns moving to total company net cash flow we delivered a positive 5 5 billion in the first quarter relative to outflows in the sequential and prior year quarters ris delivered 4 1 billion of net cash flow its fifth consecutive positive quarter and a second best quarter on record this was driven by record sales strong retention and reoccurring deposit growth in risp and ris spread sales increased 1 2 billion or 139 compared to the year ago quarter principal international generated 800 million of net cash flow it s 42nd consecutive positive quarter and 1 7 billion of positive net cash flow from our joint venture in china that is not included in reported net cash flow pgi source net cash flow turned positive in the quarter and nearly 300 million after five consecutive quarters of net outflows first quarter was the best net cash flow quarter for our us retail mutual fund business in more than two years as we ve discussed on prior calls we have approximately 3 billion in the at risk investment grade bond strategy with a single international client in pgi due to high currency hedging cost we expect clients to withdraw the entire amount over the course of the second quarter we continue to manage other assets with this client and other strategies where hedging cost can be more easily absorbed the client continues to award us additional mandates reflecting the ongoing strength of the relationship as we re all aware the asset management industry and pgi continues to experience pressure including increased demand for lower cost investment options and volatility in capital markets we re pleased with our headway on multiple fronts to address these industry pressures we re starting to see benefits emerge from restructuring our distribution teams we continue to add key resources and we re building our business intelligence to help inform our sales process positioning us for increasing success in key institutional retail markets other progress in the first quarter included the launch of more than a dozen new investment strategies across our us and international platforms with the vast majority in latin america and asia i m particularly encouraged by the continued collaboration between pgi and principal international in these markets we also launched the principal guaranteed option during the first quarter expanding our line up of fixed income investment solutions for retirement plans this new option offers a compelling crediting rate and seeks to preserve capital and support performance through deferring market cycles it s also portable customers can maintain their investment even if the plan moves to a new record keeper as a notable etf development we created a guided approach to factor investing to help customers achieve their unique goals we partnered with nasdaq dorsey wright for the first time to launch the principal ndw factor rotation model portfolio we also earned nearly 30 total placements in the first quarter with more than 20 different offerings on 16 different platforms this reflects our continued success getting our investment options added to third party distribution platforms recommended list and model portfolios more broadly we continue to see strong interest in our specialty solution oriented and alternative investment capabilities as we help clients diversify build wealth generate income protect against downside risk and address inflation i ll now share some key execution highlights starting with our planned acquisition of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business as of year end 2018 this business had more than 825 billion of assets under administration across several retirement and non retirement products including defined contribution defined benefit non qualified executive benefits institutional trust in custody and institutional asset advisory this doubled our footprint of our us retirement business increasing our retirement assets to over 500 billion and will serve a combined

volumes about who we are as a company and why we re going to be successful long term in closing again first quarter was a good start to the year for principal we continue to make steady progress in helping customers and clients achieved financial security i expect us to build additional momentum throughout 2019 and for that to translate into long term value for shareholders and each of our stakeholders deanna speaker c deanna d strable thanks dan good morning and thank you for participating on our call today i ll discuss key contributors to our first quarter financial results and i ll provide an update on capital deployment the first quarter was a good start to 2019 with net income attributable to principal of 430 million an increase of 8 from the prior year quarter non gaap operating earnings were 400 million or a 1 43 per diluted share in the first quarter eps increased 2 compared to a very strong first quarter of 2018 our non gaap operating earnings effective tax rate was 16 4 for the first quarter at the lower end of our 2019 guided range of 16 to 20 roe excluding aoci other than foreign currency translation adjustment was 13 4 on a reported basis as a result of favorable macroeconomic conditions we had three significant variances during first quarter with a positive 33 million benefit to reported non gaap pre tax operating earnings the significant variances included 15 million of lower dac amortization and ris fee due to the point to point increase in the equity markets 13 million of higher than expected encaje performance in principal international and a 5 million benefit from the net impact of inflation in latin america also in principal international excluding significant variances in both periods total company non gaap operating earnings of 376 million increased 6 from fourth quarter of 2018 but decreased 10 from the very strong year ago quarter looking at macroeconomics equity markets started the year strong with a 13 increase in the s p 500 index during the quarter despite this the daily average increased only 1 compared to fourth quarter and decreased slightly from the year ago quarter as there was only a slight increase in the daily average revenue and earnings did not receive much of a benefit from the positive market performance in the quarter foreign currency exchange rates created a headwind of 10 million for principal international s pre tax operating earnings relative to the prior year quarter but were a slight benefit compared to fourth quarter of 2018 mortality and morbidity experience for ris spread and specialty benefits we are in line with our expectations but less favorable than first quarter of 2018 seasonality impacts our first quarter results in both pgi and specialty benefits as expected pgi had higher compensation costs in the first quarter that said pgi s total operating expenses were lower than a typical first quarter also as expected specialty benefits experienced higher dental and vision claims and higher sales related expenses in the first quarter as a reminder first quarter 2018 benefited from an extremely low and unsustainable individual disability loss ratio we expect annual earnings and specialty benefits to emerge approximately 45 in the first half of the year and 55 in the second half of the year with the seasonality concentrated in the first quarter the following comments on business unit results exclude significant variances from both periods on a trailing 12 month basis excluding the annual actuarial review and encaje performance pre tax margins for all business units were within or above the 2019 guided ranges expenses continue to be well managed even with our accelerated digital on investments and other ongoing investments in the businesses pretax operating earnings for all businesses with the exception of corporate were in line with or better than our expectations for the quarter ris fees underlying business fundamentals continue to be strong compared to the year ago quarter sales were up 30 to a record 5 4 billion recurring deposits grew 9 with a 11 increase in deferrals and a 14 increase in employer matches defined contribution plan count increased more than 3 or over 1 200 plans and defined contribution participant account increased 9 with nearly 300 000 net new participants during the quarter ris spread had 2 1 billion of sales more than double the prior year quarter fixed annuity sales were 800 million and we had record first quarter pension risk transfer sales of 600 million the pipeline for pension risk transfer sales remained strong for 2019 us insurance solutions also started the year with strong sales including record sales in specialty benefits we continue to grow and deepen relationships with customers as we increased lines of coverage in our group benefits block by 13 from the prior year period pgi s pre tax operating earnings declined 11 from the prior year period to 101 million this was primarily due to lower fee revenue due to a decline in average aum resulting from muted market performance negative net cash flow and operations acquired and disposed over the trailing 12 months at 84 million corporate pre tax operating losses were higher than our expected run rate due to normal quarterly volatility in expenses for full year we do anticipate corporate losses to be above the high end of our 2019 guided range of 300 million to 320 million this is primarily due to the impact of the planned acquisition of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business and higher security benefit expenses due to the market decline at the end of 2018 after we close the acquisition we will have transaction costs and additional interest expense from our new debt issuance as well as lower investment income from using available capital to finance a portion of the acquisition as shown on slide 12 we deployed 280 million of capital during the quarter including a 150 million in common stock dividends and 130 million in share repurchases we expect to deploy well above our 1 billion to 1 4 billion capital deployment range in 2019 after taking into consideration the 1 2 billion that we committed in april for the planned acquisition of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business we anticipate the acquisition to close in the third quarter of 2019 and we are evaluating our reporting structure and financial supplement to best reflect the combined organization as shared on the acquisition announcement call we have suspended share repurchases and expect to resume no later than first quarter of 2020 last night we announced a 0 54 common stock dividend payable in the second quarter a 4 increase from a year ago on a trailing 12 month basis we have approximately a 4 dividend yield and we re at our targeted 40 net income payout ratio during the quarter we made the decision to lower our long term naic risk based capital target by 20 percentage points with the midpoint of our range now at 400 as a reminder at year end 2018 our rbc ratio was reduced by 45 percentage points as a result of a change to the naic formula associated with us tax reform our capital and liquidity positions remain very strong at the end of the first quarter we had 1 1 billion of available capital in the holding company 400 million of available cash in our subsidiaries and 200 million of capital in excess of our new rbc midpoint of 400 the financial flexibility we ve created allows us to execute the wells fargo transaction without compromising our liquidity and leverage targets we have no meaningful debt maturities until 2022 and our leverage ratio is expected to remain within our 20 to 25 targeted range whether through strategic acquisitions organic growth or investing in our businesses we continue to prioritize investments that position principal for long term success this concludes our prepared remarks operator please open the call for questions questions and answers operator operator instructions the first question will come from humphrey lee with dowling partners please go ahead humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question for renee regarding ris fees flows obviously were very good in the quarter transfer and recurring deposits were strong but one thing that is notable is that escrows ph came down meaningfully compared to the past couple of quarters can you talk about the driver for the improvement and kind of what you think about the net flows pictures for the balance of the year daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes humphrey thanks for the question it really was a great quarter for ris full service and renee is in an ideal position to respond to your question renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions thank you humphrey yes you re correct if you do look at our withdrawals for first quarter of 2019 they are favorable and if you were to dissect that a little bit further you would see that our planned sponsor or the contract withdrawals in particular were very favorable one thing to note though is as you make a quarter over one year ago quarter comparison we did have a relatively large plan withdrawal in first quarter of 2018 so that that needs to be taken excuse me third quarter excuse me first quarter pardon me and so that would have to be taken into consideration as well but it was a very good net cash flow quarter overall humphrey lee dowling partners analyst i guess are you doing anything different in terms of client retention or anything like that that helps to see the more favorable withdrawal activities renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions i would say humphrey that if you were to look at our overall model we continue to invest in the customer experience and you see this in several different ways we ve made consistent digital investments into creating new tools that would make both the planned sponsor and the participant experience better so from a planned sponsor perspective for example investing into chat features investing into new tools that would allow the planned sponsor to better serve their participants using online capabilities certainly lead to a better experience and better retention and the same thing is true in the participants side so i would say that the favorable retention results that you see here reflect a very strong underlying business model daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes the only thing i might add humphrey to that impressive list of things that renee and her team are doing is if i look at it still 50 of the sales are total retirement suite they find great value in combining deferred comp defined benefit and defined contribution also i think that the new tool that was rolled out within the last six months called picture that allows our sales reps to be more fluid in their sales presentations to prospective clients and advisors very positive feedback from the market and then also noteworthy 12 increase in the number of new advisors we are working with in this current period so i think across every one of the important metrics around leveraging technology in our position with our alliance partners where we ve got good momentum so thanks for the question humphrey humphrey lee dowling partners analyst appreciate the color just a follow up on pgi so you ve talked about the 3 billion outflows can you size and i understand they have very low fees but i was just wondering can you size the earnings impact from that outflows and then on the flip side the new mandate that you re getting from the same clients do you expect that to offset the earnings impact from the 3 billion outflow daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer amy got a quick response amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions sure thanks for the question humphrey i think as we talked before this is a good relationship with a really good client we continue to see interest in higher value added strategies that fit well with the hedging cost that they re seeing today we don t quantify exactly how much we re losing in terms of the fees related to the 3 billion but i would say the new mandate goes a fair way to replacing that revenue daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks for the question humphrey humphrey lee dowling partners analyst thank you operator the next question will come from erik bass with autonomous research please go ahead erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you for ris fee looking at the adjusted return on net revenue ex favorable dac this quarter you re still at the high end of the guidance range for the year even though fee income was still dampened a bit by markets so just wondering if there is anything else that boosted results this quarter or do you think margins at the higher end of the range are sustainable going forward daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thank you for the question erik when we look at the 30 return on net revenue for first quarter we re not seeing anything unusual that would boost the results there and so when we look forward for the remainder of the year we think our guidance of 26 to 30 remains very appropriate daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks erik bass autonomous research analyst got it and then another question for our shifting to the spread side prt activity was strong both for you and it looks like across the industry in 1q i am curious what you think is driving this and does it suggest that we re on pace for just a really strong sales year or is it a pull forward of activity daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer i think it s a great question i will have renee answer it but i will say this it s been interesting to me as we ve seen these interest rates go up and sort of tested 3 25 knocking on the door 3 5 and they falling back i think again it just sort of wakes up these things are normally in process they are in motion they ve already sort of aligned their thoughts thinking they want to unload this liability from their balance sheet and frankly it not only was a good quarter but it s an incredibly strong pipeline for the balance of the year renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes erik just to give you a little bit of color about sales that we saw in first quarter we did see about a 600 million of pension risk transfer sales and this was not dominated by a single large sale this was really many smaller sales that are smaller sized transfers that fall comfortably within our sweet spot we do continue to see a very robust pipeline for prt and the other thing that i think is very interesting when you look at the industry there s about 3 trillion of defined benefit or pension corporate plans out there and it only a very small portion of that has been derisked from corporate balance sheets so i do think we ll continue to see strong pipelines moving forward we will also continue to be very careful and very disciplined as we look at these opportunities to make sure that the risk profile and that the returns are well within our comfort range daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer sure thanks for the questions erik bass autonomous research analyst thank you operator the next question is from alex scott with goldman sachs please go ahead alex scott goldman sachs analyst hi good morning first question i had was just on pgi on the fees i mean just looking at the fee rate quarter over quarter i mean doing a calculation it seems like it dropped more than it has sequentially for a while now so i d just be interested in any commentary was there any kind of repricing activity that maybe drove that does that have to do maybe just with fewer fee days or something like that i m just trying to get a feel for if there is more pressure there or if it s just something with the calculation daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer and certainly mix comes into that as well tim you want to go ahead and take that timothy m dunbar president principal global asset management sure so the fee rate did drop as you suggest for the first quarter here and i would say the large majority of that is related to transaction fees those are predominantly on commercial real estate so if you think about first quarter after the sort of volatile fourth quarter commercial mortgage loan activity got started off at a slower pace i would say that s picked up dramatically and we re seeing that come back so we don t see that being a long term issue throughout the year we also had a little bit less than what we would have seen in performance fees and then as you suggest there has been fee pressure in the industry and we ve continued to update our fee level but that s been and so you ve seen a little bit of that but that s been a much smaller component of it alex scott goldman sachs analyst got you that s helpful and then my follow up question is just on the corporate segment compensation and other came in a bit higher i guess can you dimension how much of that you expect to continue i mean is the 300 million to 320 million range for the full year still so a good way to think about it daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes it s a good question and one of course deanna is in a good position to respond to deanna d strable executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanks alex as i mentioned earlier on the call we do now expect to be above the guidance so really have a larger last two drivers of that one that was seen in the first quarter and one that will more play out toward the end of the year the one that was seen in the first quarter was that we did have higher security benefit pension expenses that was not known at the time of the outlook call it really gets determined really on 12 31 and due to the market decline that increased our gaap expense for the pension plan and that will continue as we go throughout the year the other driver in corporate will actually be due to the impact of the wells acquisition so we will have some one time transaction costs that will come into corporate we ll also have the additional financing costs due to our debt issuance and we ll also have some lost investment income due to lower excess capital as we fund that acquisition and so that will cause us to be above that original targeted range of 300 million to 320 million i would say that the first quarter loss is a good proxy absent the impact of the wells transaction but as you have seen in corporate for many many years this will obviously be very volatile quarter to quarter daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer appreciate the questions alex alex scott goldman sachs analyst thank you operator the next question is from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan please go ahead jimmy bhullar j p morgan securities inc analyst hi good morning first i just had a question on asset management flows they obviously turned positive this quarter after i think five straight quarterly declines so does this have anything to do with any of the management changes or the initiatives that you ve been undertaking over the past year in the business or just if you could give some color on what drove this daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes we re excited about the change in direction and tim dunbar and pat halter i think have just done an extraordinarily outstanding job jimmy looking under the hood of pgi and understanding where some efficiencies and distribution could be gained and so there has been some realignment and i d also tell you that the group is highly motivated and excited about the leadership and with that i ll ask tim to fill in the blanks timothy m dunbar president principal global asset management hi jimmy thanks a lot for the question we have talked a lot about some of the management changes we ve made some of the structural changes and really trying to align the group with our clients and so really the focus has been in creating that long term relationship and bringing to bear all of the solutions that our diversified boutique model brings and so we are starting to see some positive signs of that placements on platforms of some of our products and really for this quarter one of the things i m probably most excited about is that the range of products we ve seen positive flows has really been something that we ve been trying to achieve so not only did we see some of our yield oriented products like deferreds high yields diversified real assets positive flows but even a lot of our equity products so reits blue chip which is our large cap us equity products really saw some decent flows equity income and small cap international so really across a broad range of capabilities and so we re optimistic about the future obviously second quarter we ll have some headwinds with a client that s leaving but for the second half of the year we still feel good about the net cash flows jimmy bhullar j p morgan securities inc analyst okay and then there is a lot of talk about new pension regulation secure act and how that affects smaller employers do you see that as more as an opportunity or is there a threat in there as well with the potential sort of better bargaining leverage on the part of smaller employers as they can combine to offer retirement plan daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer you know jimmy we spend a lot of time on this topic it s an important one not only important here in the us but there s a lot of pension regulation changes occurring around the world but the idea of the meps multiple employer plans we ve been in that business for a long time we understand exactly how to execute on that strategy and our vantage point is if it increases coverage and it increases adequacy for american workers we want to pursue that it s just good policy but i ll ask renee to add some additional color on how we re executing on that strategy renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions thank you jimmy as dan said we re very excited about the potential of what could evolve with pension reform in the united states and the open meps is just one of the aspects that we think will extend coverage to smaller employers but there is another aspect of this reform that i think is very important and we believe will serve americans well and that is better positioning the annuities to be a part of retirement plans moving forward as you know today it s not clear there s not a safe harbor plan design for planned sponsors to add the annuity option to inaudible defined contribution plan so we really believe that it s in the best interest of americans to have this kind of an income guarantee available to them moving forward and so we re excited not only about the open meps but also about the ability to provide that hire to retire solution to the us worker daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thanks jimmy for your questions jimmy bhullar j p morgan securities inc analyst thank you thanks operator the next question will come from john barnidge with sandler o neill please go ahead daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer john you there john barnidge sandler o neill analyst sorry my phone was muted apologies daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer okay john barnidge sandler o neill analyst specialty benefits on increase in lapse rates for group life and incurred loss rates for group dental as compared to a year ago can you talk about what you re seeing there a little bit please daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes absolutely amy please go ahead amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions yes thanks for the question john i think what we re really getting at here is probably mostly a comparison issue i think deanna mentioned in her comments before but we typically see a lot of first quarter seasonality from our dental and vision line and last year first quarter we didn t see quite as much of that i would say we re back to normal seasonality for dental and vision for first quarter of this year for group disability in terms of the loss ratios first quarter last year was unusually low we had a lot of moving pieces happening first quarter of last year that kind of made things a little noisier product by product but i would say we re back to something at this point now that we feel like is indicative of a pretty good run rate so always a reminder to on loss ratios given the seasonality given the things that can happen quarter by quarter in these businesses trailing 12 month tends to be a good guideline to go back to daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer and well within the ranges amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions and then lapses yes did you have a lapse question as well john john barnidge sandler o neill analyst yes i did thanks amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions okay let me get at the lapse question then one of the things that will happen with the businesses from quarter to quarter is we can have larger cases that have some impact into our lapses and so when i look at group life group life for first quarter of this year was impacted by some larger case lapses keep in mind that as we look at the business we look at what rates we need we ask for rate increases against that business and when i look at our group life block we are increasing the profitability and performance of that block so i m comfortable with any lapses that happened first quarter john barnidge sandler o neill analyst great and then my follow up sticking with group a bit so really strong sales continued lot of the progress seen what are you seeing there on the pricing and competitive landscape and where you re maybe seeing demand come from thank you very much daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer please amy amy c friedrich president us insurance solutions right so the landscape is competitive but not irrational in the markets that we re in so keep in mind in the markets that we re in we re mostly in that small to medium sized marketplace so we don t tend to be in that larger and we don t tend to be in the jumbo case on the hunt for some of those jumbo cases and so when i look at the pricing we re able to typically get the type of price that we want on a really attractive growth rate i would come back to i think we do the fundamentals of the business really really well especially in the small market in fact i d argue in the small market we re probably one of the best total offerings out there in terms of total value daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer appreciate the questions john john barnidge sandler o neill analyst thank you operator the next question will come from ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods analyst hi thanks good morning i had a question on the wells retirement acquisition more strategic in the past principal typically seemed more cautious on the larger case record keeping business so i was hoping you could give some perspective on how and why your view on that has changed now daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes ryan thanks for that question i can t tell you how excited we are about welding the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business to principal for a lot of different reasons we actually as you have pointed out have focused on that small to medium with a modest amount of large plans and then if you looked at their block it really inserts nicely because we actually have more jumbo cases than wells fargo has so there is a little bit of a gap in our sort of total lineup so we re excited about what that fills additionally as was mentioned in the prepared comments the fact that they have this trust business it gives us some additional flexibilities i would also tell you that the fact that they have an esop program in place a non qualified structure in place it just fits like hand in glove in terms of our existing structure so other than size it is also additive and that they have historically worked with a group of advisors consultants that maybe weren t first top of mind for principal and given our strategy in terms of bringing over a large percentage of the relationship managers and the consultants relationship management teams et cetera we feel that we can really create a seamless transition for the advisors for the clients for the participants and just frankly add a whole lot more value and with that i realize i took quite a bit of time renee but would love to have you make some additional comments renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thank you yes i would agree with dan s comments this acquisition is really ideal from so many different perspectives first off it reinforces our commitment to the retirement industry and when you look traditionally at the capabilities that we ve brought to the marketplace from a record keeping perspective we serve a wide range of clients in terms of size in terms of makeup in terms of the various characteristics and needs and so having the ability to add scale to our record keeping platforms makes us that much more competitive the ability to lower the unit cost the ability to scale our platforms to allow us to remain competitive in the industry to continue to invest in this business and to deliver favorable margins the capabilities that we re adding in the large plan market are very attractive to us adding abilities in the consulting channel again is very important and the last thing that i ll mention is we also have access to a very experienced and talented employee pool and i can t stress that enough we had the opportunity this past week to invite about 100 of the wells fargo institutional retirement trust team members into des moines and i can t tell you the level of energy and enthusiasm that we had among the group and what struck me was the commonality that we all have in terms of keeping the customer at the center and making sure that everything that we do is customer centric and will advance our ability to serve both the plan sponsor and the participants in the years to come so we re very excited about this transition and the acquisition ryan krueger keefe bruyette woods analyst great thank you very much daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer thank you ryan appreciate it operator the next question will come from andrew kligerman with credit suisse please go ahead andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey good morning maybe just staying on ris fee for a bit just in terms of the fee levels maybe you could give a little guidance as to where you kind of see that going in the next year or two we kind of do a calculation we calculated 66 basis points of fees and other revenues divided by average assets in 17 and then it was 63 basis points last year and then we look at this quarter and it was about 58 basis points and i know that it has something to do with the average share of daily balances versus 59 basis points in prior quarter but maybe you could just give us a little color on where you see that going over the next one or two or three years daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer we will be happy to cover that renee renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions sure first off let s maybe take a look at what happened in first quarter and then i ll make some comments about what we might expect moving forward but when we look at first quarter and you compare that to a quarter one year ago the first thing to keep in mind is that the s p daily average was down about 0 5 and so that of course had a very that muted market performance had an impact on the year over year fee levels that you can expect for us to deliver and so a portion of that of the gaap there was about a 6 gaap year over year quarter over quarter rather so most of that again as a result of a very muted market performance the other thing that i would draw your attention to is when we and we mentioned this in our outlook call we anticipate seeing about 1 to 2 decline in fees as a result of commissions beginning to transfer to fees paid to advisors and what this does is it reduces the net revenue but it also reduces the commission line so that the impact to the pre tax operating earnings remains the same and the impact to the margin risk remains the same and just a quick commentary on that trend we view that very favorably it absolutely isolates the advisor compensation and makes that very visible to the plan sponsor and it removes it from a conversation that s necessary as we think about our fees with the plan sponsor so we would anticipate that kind of activity to continue so then looking forward historically you ve heard us talk about that 5 to 8 gaap between growth in account values and growth in net revenues and that s a result of the typical pressures within the industry on revenues that results from decoupling the record keeping decision from the investment management decision the open architecture reduction in investment management fees due to passive investing things of that nature we envision that that s a reasonable guideline moving forward so we would say you can expect to see about a 5 to 8 gap due to simple industry revenue pressures as well as maybe 1 to 2 shift due to commissions moving to a fee based compensation arrangement daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer andrew i think it also speaks to why we feel we have to have scale in these businesses for this very reason andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it and very helpful and then just the next question actually maybe i could just sneak a one liner before the next question but just the tax rate at 16 4 and deanna talked about 16 to 20 guidance can we expect the low end going forward and then just shifting over to just staying on pension risk transfer maybe talk about the level of competition in these smaller accounts you mentioned that the pricing is better than the jumbo but how many competitors do you see when you typically go after one of these smaller prts is it aggressive daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes let me take both of those i would say that the tax rate we still think it s going to be well within the range i wouldn t want to speculate at this point in time on a full year basis but when we look at the tax rate it s on the lower end but well within the range on the pension risk transfer business it really does break into two different groups large and small think about kind of below half a billion and greater than a half a billion and i would say in each case there s about a half a dozen key competitors we know who they are we know how they get to where they re at we re still getting what we consider to be a very nice return on invested capital in these lines of business there are a few more competitors today than there was two or three years ago and it is a competitive marketplace but we think we re getting more than adequately compensated for the use of the capital for this line of business and again very committed to it appreciate the question andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thank you operator the next question will come from thomas gallagher with evercore please go ahead thomas gallager evercore isi analyst good morning another follow up on ris fee so it looks like and it is going to be related to i guess the comment that you made about the 5 to 8 gaap in revenue growth versus asset growth but if i look at the disclosure that you have between plan sizes it looks to me like either all or a vast majority of your growth inflows is coming from 1 000 lives and larger plans if i just look at either planned growth or asset growth is that a fair characterization i mean in terms of the business that s a thousand lives in smaller are you actually seeing net outflows overall and can you talk a little bit about what the economic difference is if revenue fee yield for these large plans versus mid to small daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes we actually see good net cash flow in each of the market segments but i ll have renee speak specifically to your question tom renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions yes thank you for the question tom when we look at the mix of business that we have between the larger plan and the smaller plan we re actually seeing good growth in both of these segments and certainly the retention of clients in both of these segments remains very positive in any one quarter we will tend to see sales migrate just naturally we ll see some volatility or some difference in the mix of the business that we sell so for example in the first quarter if you look at that record 5 4 billion of sales you will see that it is not dominated by any single large plan at all but there is a really nice mix of the mid sized plans and that will vary from quarter to quarter with respect to your question around the variation in the revenues that we would collect as you might imagine with smaller plans we tend to not only pickup the record keeping but oftentimes we pick up a share a larger share of the asset management as well and with the larger plans they tend to steer more toward open architecture and our ability to win or capture assets is certainly favorable in that size market but it s going to be less than what you see in the smaller plan market so we feel very comfortable with the business mix we feel very comfortable with our approach and our ability to deliver growth in both small and large plans and certainly our ability to retain that daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think the other thing worth noting tom on the asset retention part it s fairly indiscriminate on the relative size of the employer we have a really good shot at small medium and large individuals who are part of a plan and who are looking for advice that benefit even whether it s a job changer or a retiree thomas gallager evercore isi analyst got you and just a follow up on that can you break out in terms of flows how much of your flows if you could quantify of the i think it s what 3 4 billion of cash flows would have been 1 000 lives in larger versus below that size if you re able to quantify that daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer you know that s not something we re going to provide at this point but appreciate your comment thank you thomas gallager evercore isi analyst thanks operator the final question is from suneet kamath with citi please go ahead suneet kamath citi analyst thanks just want to circle back on the wells deal so in ris fee i think you spent a fair amount of money on digital over the past couple of years as you get to know the wells block any color on are you getting anything that you didn t have or there is going to be some incremental expenses that you re going to have to incur to get digital on those plans just any color there would be helpful daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes great question and as you might expect you get some of that doing due diligence but the real lift is starting as we speak to really fully understand some of the capabilities and what you might onboard to augment it is our promise and commitment to take best in class on all fronts with that renee do you want to add some additional color on specificity renee schaaf president retirement and income solutions sure when we think about the path forward and how we will integrate our businesses we ve really arrived at thinking about this in terms of four overarching principles and the first principle is to keep the customer clearly at the center and to make sure that we minimize any disruption in service that we do everything we can to provide business as usual and excellent service to those clients the second thing as dan mentioned we have the ideal opportunity to take the best from both operations and team and to put this together into an extremely compelling offering to the marketplace the next thing that we re very concerned about and we re paying a lot of attention to is talent we are picking up a very experienced team from the wells fargo institutional retirement trust business and we want to make sure that we do everything we can to make their onboarding smooth as well and then last of all we don t view this as just an integration of business we view this as an opportunity to create unsurpassed value to the marketplace this is our opportunity to move the needle and so we ll approach this very thoughtfully very carefully and you can expect to hear a lot more on this as the months ahead unfold suneet kamath citi analyst got it makes sense and then my follow up is again on ris fee if i look at your disclosures it looks like the percentage of assets that are non proprietary is now slightly over a third of the mix and it s been the fastest growing piece based on your disclosure so i guess is that performance is that fee related is it active to passive and where does that i think it s about 33 5 today where does that do you think that goes over the next couple of years thanks daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer yes so maybe quickly on that one it hasn t part as renee described earlier a difference on the size of the plan sponsor and if you re skewing toward the larger and you re going to put downward pressure on the percentage of proprietary asset management the percentage of small medium and large they ve drifted slightly downward over the last few years but again it s our objective to be customer centric provide customers and advisors for what they are looking for there are multiple sources of revenue growth for principal in totality and so we continue to manage that but we will continue to be a customer centered in how we present our investment offerings the fees are competitive the performance is good a little bit of a hiccup in the q4 period but as i look at the relative strength of the investment performance on 1 3 and 5 that still puts us in a formidable position to attract a lot of assets the last thing i would say and you can t forget this we still capture a lot of assets through dcio it s where we re putting our investment options on our competitors platform and again that s been a growth engine for the company as well and those results are not shown in full service but rather within pgi so thank you for the question operator we have reached the end of our q a session mr houston your closing comments please daniel j houston chairman president and chief executive officer good thank you and again from our perspective good start to the year we do have multiple parallel paths of growth that we re executing on as we speak and we ve talked about this one is around the digitizing of our business and it does have some cost but that is starting to bear fruit and we re excited about what that s going to deliver we also remain very enthusiastic about successfully onboarding the wells fargo retirement trust customers and i emphasize both the retirement and the trust customers it s a big part of their franchise as well as putting us in a favorable position with their advisors and their clients and executing on that the third is around our operational excellence initiative a big undertaking for us here as we continue to be as efficient as we can in aligning our resources with the needs of our customers and then lastly as you would expect delivering outstanding customer service and again if you looked at all the growth initiatives for the first quarter there is a clear sign that there is a good value proposition for principal clients and so with that thank you for taking the time today and look forward to seeing you on the road thank you operator

of buying lifted the major u s stock indexes which had spent much of the day in a sideways drift the gains nudged the benchmark s p 500 index and nasdaq composite to new closing highs for the second time this week both indexes also set record highs on tuesday the dow jones industrial average eked out a gain but ended the week slightly lower the market s latest milestones came as investors weighed a mixed bag of corporate earnings solid quarterly reports from ford and amazon helped lift the market weaker showings from intel and exxon mobil cut into the dow s gains smaller company stocks fared better than the rest of the market a bullish sign indicating that investors were more willing to take on risk while company earnings were mixed investors drew encouragement from a government report estimating that the u s economy grew at a solid 3 2 annual rate in the first three months of the year a much bigger increase than expected the first quarter number is typically the weakest of the year so the fact that this number was so strong is a positive sign going forward said cliff hodge director of investments for cornerstone wealth the s p 500 rose 13 71 points or 0 5 to 2 939 88 the broad index is now up 17 3 this year the dow rose 81 25 points or 0 3 to 26 543 33 the nasdaq composite recovered from an early slide adding 27 72 points or 0 3 to 8 146 40 the russell 2000 index of smaller

500 s latest all time high underscores the market s blockbuster turnaround this year after nosediving at the end of 2018 amid fears of a recession an escalating trade war between the u s and china and concern that the federal reserve was moving too aggressively to raise interest rates in the months since those concerns have eased or taken a back seat to more optimism among investors about the prospects for steady economic growth improved economic data out of china and signals that washington and beijing are making progress toward resolving their costly trade dispute has also helped ease market jitters perhaps most of all traders have been encouraged by an increasingly hands off fed which has signaled that it may not raise interest rates at all in 2019 after seven increases the previous two years more recently companies that have reported first quarter results have mostly met profit forecasts taking some pressure off the market u s companies are about a third of the way through their latest round of quarterly reports so far they ve avoided analysts most dire predictions for a severe contraction it s marginally better than expected so the market has rallied a bit said andrew slimmon managing director and senior portfolio manager at morgan stanley investment management meanwhile investor fears of a potential recession have subsided since the year started helping the market steadily recover from its fourth quarter meltdown with no recession the market was due for a bounce back he said noting that investors seem to be complacent with a less volatile market which he said could be setting it up for a pullback wall street s strong recover this year has helped fuel a surge in corporate deals so far this year there have been 711 billion in mergers and acquisitions in the u s the fastest start to a year on record according to dealogic the market has also been rewarding some technology companies since their highly anticipated stock market debuts pinterest and zoom

washington dc april 26 2019 u s economic growth accelerated in the first quarter but the burst in growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015 temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters gross domestic product increased at a 3 2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter the commerce department said in its advance gdp report released on friday growth was also boosted by an increase in government investment but consumer and business spending slowed sharply and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter giving the report a weak tone while the report suggested there is no recession on the horizon its details painted a picture of an economy that is slowing as the stimulus from the white house s 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades and the effects of past interest rate increases by the federal reserve linger fears of a recession were stoked by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve last month the gain in first quarter gdp would seem to make a mockery of claims that the u s economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto looking beyond the headline number however there are plenty of causes for concern the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the october december period economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp increasing at a 2 0 percent rate in the first three months of the year growth has stepped down from a peak 4 2 percent pace in the second quarter of 2018 the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record fed officials are likely to shrug off the surge in growth last quarter and focus on a measure of domestic demand that increased at only a 1 3 percent rate the slowest since the second quarter of 2013 it increased at a 2 6 percent pace in the october december quarter the fed recently suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign dropping forecasts for any rate hikes this year the u s central bank increased borrowing costs four times in 2018 u s treasury yields jumped after the release of the data before retracing and the u s dollar rose against a basket of currencies before reversing course u s stock index futures were trading mixed business spending stalls exports surged and imports declined in the first quarter leading to a small deficit that added 1 03 percentage points to gdp after being neutral in the fourth quarter trade tensions between the united states and china have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants the standoff has also had an impact on inventories which increased at a 128 4 billion rate in the first quarter the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015 inventories increased at a 96 8 billion pace in the october december quarter part of the inventory build was because of weak demand especially in the automotive sector which is expected to weigh on future production at factories inventories contributed 0 65 percentage point to first quarter gdp after adding one tenth of a percentage point in the october december period growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity slowed to a 1 2 percent rate from the fourth quarter s 2 5 percent rate the moderation in spending reflected a decline in motor vehicle purchases and other goods likely related to a 35 day shutdown of the federal government there was also a slowdown in spending on services the government said while it could not quantify the full effects of the shutdown it estimated that reductions in labor services supplied by federal workers and intermediate purchases of goods and services by non defense agencies had subtracted three tenths of a percentage point from gdp last quarter business spending on equipment braked sharply rising at only at a 0 2 percent rate the slowest since the third quarter of 2016 spending was held down by weak outlays on agricultural machinery and office furniture investment in structures contracted for a third straight quarter residential construction fell at a 2 8 percent rate marking the fifth straight quarterly decline government investment rebounded at a 2 4 percent rate driven by spending at state and local governments reuters
monitoring desk washington the united states economy surged unexpectedly in the first quarter the commerce department said friday allaying concern that financial market volatility and a prolonged government shutdown would cause a slump that is good news for president trump who is counting on a strong economy to improve his chances for re election with investors and consumers alike showing renewed optimism it is now all but certain that the decade long expansion will become the longest on record later this year the angst has settled and the economy has come back said ben herzon an economist with macroeconomic advisers a forecasting firm i just can t point to anything now that s going to push us into recession gross domestic product the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy rose at a 3 2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year that is faster than most economists expected and far better than the dour outlook of early this year when many forecast that the figure could fall below 1 percent friday s figures are preliminary and will be revised at least twice in the months ahead economists warned that the report was inflated by short term factors and probably overstated the underlying pace of growth most anticipate a downshift as the year progresses still after a rough winter the economy appears to have entered the spring fundamentally intact mr trump heralded the report on friday declaring the first quarter growth figure an incredible number we re number one economy right now in the world and it s not even close he told reporters on his way to an event in indianapolis mr trump has often treated g d p along with the stock market the trade deficit and other economic indicators as a sort of scorecard for his presidency late last year that scorecard wasn t looking good as growth slowed the trade deficit ballooned and the stock market plunged kevin hassett chairman of the president s council of economic advisers acknowledged on friday that there had been nervousness inside the white house that the partial federal government shutdown which idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and disrupted countless private businesses could cause growth to stall in the first quarter a sharp drop in consumer spending in december and a slowdown in job growth in february added to those fears things have looked up since then however consumer confidence rebounded quickly once the shutdown ended and retail sales were strong in march hiring too has recovered and the stock market has roared back hitting record highs this week everything kind of turned around relatively quickly mr hassett said the government reopened a lot of uncertainty resolved equity markets started to get more confident and then i think a lot of other people did too several factors explain the renewed optimism efforts by chinese authorities to stabilize their slumping economy seem to be working damping fears of a global economic slowdown china and the united states also appear to be nearing a trade deal reducing the risk of a new round of tariffs perhaps the most important factor in the turnaround the federal reserve markets began to stabilize and stocks climbed again after jerome h powell the fed chairman said in january that the central bank would be patient before raising interest rates again after four increases in 2018 mr trump and his allies had been sharply critical of the fed s rate hikes the president has said he will nominate one such ally stephen moore to fill an opening at the fed on friday mr moore an informal economic adviser to mr trump said the new growth figure made him feel 100 percent vindicated in his criticisms thank god the fed listened to me mr moore said mr powell has said the president s criticisms won t influence the bank s decisions still mr trump has gotten what he wanted when fed policymakers meet next week it is essentially a foregone conclusion that they will leave interest rates unchanged fed officials indicated in march that they did not expect to raise rates again this year in part because they forecast a growth slowdown from last year and still tame inflation friday s report showed inflation slowing yet further in the first quarter indeed despite the robust g d p figure the underlying pace of economic growth has slowed since the middle of last year when tax cuts and government spending briefly pushed the growth rate above 4 percent consumer spending a bedrock of the recovery was weak in the first quarter but retail sales picked up in march and economists expect stronger spending in the second quarter the most important components of the economy consumer spending and business investment were both weak in the first quarter and the housing market contracted for the fifth quarter in a row the strength in g d p was partly the result of a surge in inventories and a drop in imports both of which are likely to reverse in the second quarter for a better gauge of the economy s health analysts recommend focusing on a different number which strips out trade and inventory effects as well as the impact of government spending that measure known as final private sales came in at 1 3 percent down from 2 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the weakest showing since 2013 domestic demand in the economy investment consumer spending that was weak said ellen zentner chief united states economist for morgan stanley economists expect consumer spending to bounce back in the second quarter as december s market drop and january s shutdown fade into memory but businesses remain cautious in part because they expect the economy to cool gradually as the effects of last year s tax cuts and spending increases fade if there s weakness it s in the business spending data said michael gapen chief united states economist for barclays it has yet to rebound in a meaningful way following the end of the government shutdown worthington industries an ohio based metals manufacturer has seen no sign of a slowdown from its domestic customers said andy rose the company s president still spending isn t rising as quickly as it did early in the recovery and slower growth in china and other countries has hurt sales overseas while mr trump s steel tariffs have driven up costs we re not seeing a drop off but i think the challenge for a lot of u s companies right now is to find where the next leg up is going to come from mr rose said how are we going to drive earnings growth going forward if we re not going to see a big increase in demand that means companies are looking for other ways to improve profitability including cutting costs cost cutting certainly is a late cycle exercise mr rose said labor costs are going up you have no choice but to try to save costs where you can that caution may reflect nervousness about how long the economy s run of good fortune can last the great recession officially ended in june 2009 in july the expansion will officially become the longest on record economists however say that expansions do not die of old age there has to be a cause and while they expect growth to slow this year they see few risks on the horizon that are large enough to tip the economy over the edge we had a near miss on a recession but we didn t have one last year said joe brusuelas chief economist for rsm a financial consulting firm we won t have one this year i think this is a good place for the economy to be courtesy nytimes com

yesterday we reported fiscal 2019 third quarter results which reflected sears related weakness in north america as expected prolonged drought related softness in europe and australia and inefficiencies mainly related to the ramp up of our new commercial manufacturing operations while we were disappointed with the results the quarter held some meaningful bright spots mainly continued strong sustainable share gains in commercial engines and products the conversion of all remaining ferris mower production to our new plant and improved order fill rates on our service and parts business we were disappointed in the overall financial performance also as a result we announced a revision to our guidance for the 2019 fiscal year despite the near term headwinds we remain encouraged about the foundation of our business and remain confident in achieving our long term financial goals sales for the fiscal 2019 third quarter were down 24 million or 4 to 580 million product sales were strong up 26 million or approximately 10 engine sales declined 48 million or 13 with more than half of the sales declined due to the due to a reduction in international shipments of residential engines in europe retailers and dealers have been cautious in their buying patterns and have significantly slowed their seasonal ordering to work through current inventories following last season s drought ground moisture has significantly improved after the historic drought last season while spring temperatures have been somewhat cooler than normal however we along with several of our oem partners have had underestimated the level of channel inventory that remained at the end of last season the elevated inventories coupled with a lack of early spring season has caused retailers to be very cautious in their early season ordering patterns in australia historically severe drought conditions continue to the majority of the lawn and garden season which significantly hampered sales we had expected some late season rebound in order activity in the third quarter but the rebound failed to materialize given the continued dry conditions in north america the market for engines has played out much as expected as previewed last quarter we expected the sears bankruptcy to cause near term disruption in the market primarily in the third quarter as consumers migrate their shopping patterns and adjust to this change in the retail landscape we estimated the impact of the exit at approximately 25 million of sales in the third quarter which is predominantly comprised the sales of engines and service parts at the same time engine placement for other north america retailers were strong shipments to fill stores following brand transitions were particularly robust with early indications that consumers are responding positively to the brand changes the spring season here in the u s got off to a cooler than normal start in march which somewhat constrained our commercial mover growth and led to lower residential riding mower sales in the third quarter within our products segment temperatures improved in april and we ve seen more robust sell through to date which is encouraging we continued to achieve strong pressure washer sales growth in the third quarter due to our launch of craftsman branded units at lowe s this spring as well as elevated pollen levels in the southern u s the real strength in our business continued to be the commercial categories on a trailing 12 month basis sales of commercial products and engines grew 18 and accounted for 30 of total sales the strength was broad based including growth in job site ferris commercial mowers and hurricane stand on blowers which we acquired last year this success is a direct result of offering our customers demonstrably better more innovative products that make the end user more productive and deliver a lower total cost of ownership the growth in commercial demonstrates that we are truly winning in the marketplace and making significant sustainable share gains across all lines we have expanded distribution with increases in the number of dealerships distributors and rental houses for job site and commercial turf products over the past two fiscal years for example we have secured more than 60 new oem placements and wins for our commercial engines and turf products the quality of our products has led to substantial growth with multiple established oems as well third quarter results also include the impact of lower engine sales in production volumes unfavorable sales mix and inefficiencies which contributed to reduce profitability mark will provide more specifics on each but i would like to cover the inefficiencies during the quarter our results included approximately 8 million of inefficiencies primarily related to the start up of our business optimization initiatives operational excellence is a cornerstone of how we run the business consequently we are disappointed in our performance this past quarter and have worked diligently to implement solutions to restore operational excellence going forward the inefficiency breakdown in three areas freight costs incremental labor and production speed i would like to briefly comment on each first elevated freight spending accounted for approximately 40 of the 8 million in inefficiencies a large portion of freight spending was driven by unusual market conditions in which the rate to ship containers from china to the u s nearly doubled for a period of time during the quarter this spike in shipping rates was driven by a surge in global demand on the china to u s shipping routes the container rates dropped back in line by the end of the quarter the remainder of the elevated freight spend we incurred related to the start up of our projects to bring production of vanguard engines onshore and support our commercial mower growth we incurred elevated freight charges caused by supply chain issues in asia resulting in the need to air freight components to allow us to meet customer demand we also experienced increased costs for outbound freight to ship mowers to dealers and distributors driven by a shift in orders during the quarter to our newest models for which we had not been able to build the necessary inventory accordingly we were not able to fully consolidate shipments which increased cost despite the higher outbound shipping costs we met our commitments to our dealers by maximizing order fill rates at a crucial time in the selling season for commercial mowers and other products we have already taken actions to remediate these start up issues and anticipate reduced freight inefficiencies in the fourth quarter we do not expect the vast majority of freight inefficiencies to repeat in fiscal 2020 second incremental labor in the form of overtime and temporary workers accounted for another 40 of the total inefficiencies as we approach the peak season we opted to increase the temporary manpower in certain of our locations particularly within our north america service distribution center to ensure that we could meet peak season demand we have implemented plans to reduce the heightened labor in the fourth quarter as we gain more familiarity and rhythm with the new process following the upgrade of our erp system based on this we do not expect the vast majority of labor inefficiencies to repeat in fiscal 2020 the third and remaining 20 of inefficiencies in the quarter pertain to the ramp up of vanguard engine production at our u s facilities which fell short of our goals throughout the third quarter however we improved throughput and are now positioned to substantially achieve our original planned build rate for the fourth quarter we have also had the benefit of continued manufacturing volume from our japanese joint venture so as to ensure that we have plenty of vanguard engines to keep pace with the fast growing customer demand through the onshore in transition you can be assured that addressing the inefficiencies and restoring operational excellence has our full attention you can also be assured that we are going to do the right things to meet customer commitments the work our team has put in to improve the operations today has already driven up service parts fulfillment rates and we ve been able to keep up with the fast growing customer demand for our commercial engines and mowers this significant progress gives us great confidence we will drive improvements in closing out fiscal 2019 and we will drive substantial profitability improvements going into fiscal 2020 i would like to add that despite these near term headwinds we remain very encouraged about our long term prospects we have laid a solid foundation to accelerate growth improve profitability and drive higher capital returns we are already demonstrating the success for our strategy to diversify our business into higher margin commercial products and we remain confident that our business optimization program would deliver upwards of 40 million in pre tax cost savings by fiscal 2021 now here is mark to walk through our financial results for fiscal 2019 third quarter and provide details on the revised earnings outlook mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group thanks todd i ll begin by touching on some highlights from the financial results third quarter gaap consolidated net income of 8 million included business optimization costs and acquisition related charges of 6 6 million excluding these costs third quarter adjusted net income was 14 6 million or 0 34 per diluted share down from 0 84 for last year s adjusted eps the engines and product segments recognized 5 2 million and 4 7 million of pre tax charges respectively engines segment sales for the third quarter were 336 million a decrease of approximately 48 million from the prior year engine unit sales were approximately 2 1 million a decrease of 18 or approximately 456 000 engines engine sales decreased primarily for the reasons todd mentioned earlier namely the decline in shipments for sears and drought related softness in europe and australia in addition at our fiscal second quarter we had commented that 20 million of sales had accelerated from the third quarter for sequentially earlier production this season largely in support of brand transitions service parts sales were down slightly in the third quarter partly offsetting the reduction in sales vanguard commercial engine sales grew by nearly 10 in the third quarter in addition higher pricing was in place to offset higher material costs and tariffs the engines segment adjusted gross profit margin of 21 8 was down from 25 4 a year ago reflecting unfavorable sales mix lower production volumes and an increase in manufacturing inefficiencies unfavorable sales mix led to a decline in margins of approximately 160 basis points the mix change was due to proportionately less sales of engines to customers outside the u s which typically contained higher margins and lower service parts sales quarterly engine production volume was 1 7 million units down 14 from last year s third quarter production of 2 million units the lower production had an unfavorable impact on margins of approximately 130 basis points which is roughly in line with what we had anticipated total engine inventories at the end of the fiscal 2019 third quarter were approximately 1 7 million units which is consistent with a year ago inventory dollars are higher year over year due to proportionately more large engines and inventory and higher components on hand to support the onshoring of vanguard engines we expect the higher inventory levels of commercial engines to decrease before the end of the fiscal year and into early fiscal 2020 as we complete the onshoring program inefficiencies drove 100 basis points of the margin decline as todd detailed earlier the elevated freight costs higher labor costs and our vanguard production ramp up following behind the planned rate primarily drove to the inefficiencies and we are making good progress on actively abating the issues engines segment adjusted esg a declined by 3 million primarily from lower employee related expenses engines segment adjusted income of 28 million was down from 15 6 million a year ago product segment net sales for the third quarter increased by 26 million or 11 the increase was primarily due to 16 growth of commercial sales resulting from higher sales of ferris mowers and growth from the hurricane acquisition residential sales grew slightly on higher volumes of standby generators and pressure washers partially offset by lower sales of portable generators and riding mowers following cool spring temperatures in the u s outside the u s we achieved higher sales in brazil sales also benefited from higher prices to offset cost inflation adjusted gross profit margin in the product segment of 10 2 for the quarter was down from 13 8 for the same quarter last year largely due to inefficiencies and unfavorable sales mix inefficiencies were responsible for approximately 180 basis points for the margin decline were caused by the items todd detailed earlier including elevated freight costs and higher labor costs in addition to the inflated overseas container costs todd mentioned we incurred higher domestic outbound freight costs as we refined our processes to optimize loads from our plants to dealers and distributors the task of optimizing freight and manufacturing labor for our commercial lawn and garden products was complicated in the third quarter by the rapid growth in customer demand and the plant transition all remaining production of our ferris mowers transitioned to the new plant early in the third quarter and we are pleased with the build rate and product quality similar to the engines segment the product segment incurred higher labor costs to improve the throughput of service parts to support the peak season as todd mentioned earlier we have a clear line of sight to the causes of the inefficiencies and are actively working to abate the issues unfavorable sales mix drove approximately 170 basis points of margin decline in the third quarter for the products segment the mix change was driven by robust sales growth of pressure washers due to elevated pollen levels of the spring and brand transitions at retail lower sales of products with comparatively higher margins included lower sales of portable generators from fewer springtime storms and lower replenishment following a less active storm season this past fall in addition as todd mentioned earlier sales of residential riding mowers through our dealer channel were lower year over year due to the cool march weather higher sales of commercial mowers partially offset the unfavorable margin mix increases in material and tariff costs were largely offset by pricing product segment adjusted esg a expenses were down 1 9 million primarily from a reduction in employee compensation expenses the segment s adjusted loss for the quarter was 1 million compared with the adjusted income of 3 7 million for the third quarter of 2018 on the balance sheet net debt was 383 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter up from 279 million a year ago but down 93 million from the end of the second quarter in addition to funding internal projects to support our business optimization program our primarily primary goal for cash is to continue to pay down debt to strengthen the balance sheet further we expect to reduce inventory by over 100 million from current levels by the end of the fiscal year last 12 month cash provided by operating activities was 7 million and last 12 month free cash flow was negative 65 million depreciation and amortization for the quarter of 15 million was lower than capital expenditures of 12 million largely due to the winding down of investments in our business optimization program we continue to estimate that we will spend 65 million on capital spending this year a decrease of nearly 40 million from last year at the end of the quarter last 12 month average funded debt was 402 million and last 12 month ebitda was 131 million both was defined by our credit agreement resulting in a leverage ratio of 3 06 times which is within our debt covenant although leverage is elevated from where we have been historically we project that improved earnings and lower spending due to the completion of a business optimization program will result in decreasing leverage in future quarters before i turn the call back over to todd for his closing remarks let me spend a moment on the fiscal 2019 full year and fourth quarter outlook for the full year we expect sales in the range of 1 86 billion to 1 91 billion a decrease of approximately 40 million from our previous outlook approximately 30 million of the downward revision is due to weather related market conditions in australia and europe we incurred the majority of this revision in the third quarter with approximately 10 million of the outlook reduction expected to impact the fourth quarter given normal weather conditions this season we would expect elevated channel inventories in europe to normalize through the course of this season which would support a rebound in engine sales next year given the prolonged and severe nature of the drought in australia we believe that channel inventories are elevated and will not support a significant rebound in our sales next year there the australian market is substantially smaller however than the u s and europe markets in the u s we now estimate that service part sales will be lower than previously expected by approximately 10 million although we have substantially improved the throughput of our service distribution center and have improved fill rates we do not believe we ll fully restore our safety stock levels prior to the end of fiscal year we expect to normalize channel inventory early in the summer following the peak shipping season we also anticipate less favorable sales mix compared to our prior outlook following the cool start to spring in the third quarter we expect the growth of lawn and garden equipment to be slightly less than what was contemplated on our previous outlook offsetting this from a top line perspective we expect higher pressure washer sales given the amount of pollen growth in the southern u s and the success of the craftsman brand launch at lowe s these factors are expected to be neutral on sales and unfavorable to margins in response to the anticipated lower engine sales due to market conditions in australia and europe we plan to decrease engine production in the fourth quarter by 350 000 units compared to what we previously plan to produce we use production as expected to lower pre tax income by approximately 4 million to 5 million total engine production for fiscal 2019 is now expected to be 5 9 million units or about 1 million less than what was produced a year ago we had anticipated producing nearly 6 8 million units at the outset of fiscal 2019 but have since lowered production in response to transitory market conditions including the sears exit from the market combined with weather related softness in australia and europe because we have lowered production this year we expect to end fiscal 2019 with fewer engines than last year this reduction will help us manage working capital and should create the need for some rebound in production levels during fiscal 2020 taken together the impact of lower sales unfavorable sales mix and reduced production net of offsetting spending reductions is expected to be a reduction of 22 million pre tax or 0 40 per diluted share to our fiscal 2019 outlook in addition we expect start up inefficiencies associated with our business optimization initiatives net of spending to reduce our full year diluted earnings per share by approximately 30 million pre tax or 0 25 per diluted share although we believe we have addressed the majority of the causes driving inefficiencies we expect fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by inefficiency costs of 4 million to 5 million a portion of these costs were actually incurred prior to the fourth quarter but will only be recognized in the fourth quarter upon sale of the inventory as a result the inefficiency costs incurred in the fourth quarter are expected to be down substantially from what was recognized in the third quarter as indicated in last evening s earnings release we expect fiscal 2019 equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to be 11 5 million and we expect interest expense to be 28 5 million the consolidated tax rate expected to be 10 to 12 due to the change in expected pre tax earnings for the full year we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 0 45 to 0 65 per share lastly regarding the fourth quarter the midpoint of our sales guidance projects an increase of 4 compared to last year s fourth quarter as a reminder sales in last year s fourth quarter were negatively impacted by poor springtime weather in the u s as well as channel inventory reductions these factors were partially mitigated by the benefit we received last year due to shipping approximately 20 million of sales to build customer safety stock in advance of our erp upgrade go live which will not repeat for the current year despite a slow start in march we are optimistic regarding the u s lawn and garden season and are encouraged by april retail activity to date somewhat temporary fourth quarter sales growth our anticipated headwinds associated with the europe market conditions and their exit of sears here and the exit of sears here in the u s accordingly we expect engine sales in the fourth quarter to be relatively flat to last year we expect the fourth quarter consolidated gross margin rate to be lower than last year s fourth quarter margin rate by a little over 100 basis points the decrease is due to our anticipation of producing approximately 400 000 fewer engines in the fourth quarter than a year ago as mentioned previously we also expect 4 million to 5 million of inefficiency charges will impact fourth quarter earnings together lower production and inefficiencies are expected to pressure fourth quarter margins by approximately 170 basis points we expect to achieve offsets to these margin pressures from a favorable sales mix which will include higher commercial sales as well as higher service part sales and savings of approximately 2 million from our business optimization program we expect fourth quarter adjusted esg a spending to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter last year now let me turn the call back over to todd for some closing remarks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer third quarter results had several encouraging developments supporting the fundamental soundness of our long term strategy we continue to make significant progress in the diversification of our business into higher growth commercial products and engines customers are clearly responding to the innovation we are bringing to the market with products that deliver greater up time and make the professional more productive the same attention to user driven innovation is driving greater adoption of our engines while we have clearly faced some near term challenges we are making progress on several fronts which strengthens our optimism and confidence about our future and our ability to create value for our shareholders on our business optimization program we have made significant progress on adapting business processes to our erp upgrade particularly in our service parts area which we expect to be substantially back to normal operations this summer in commercial engines demand remained strong as volumes increased at our auburn alabama plant from the onshoring of production from our joint venture and product quality remains high our statesboro georgia facility continues to be in ramp up mode and is expected to be in full production by this summer similarly our new commercial mower plant in upstate new york is performing well as professional landscapers are increasingly choosing ferris and other briggs commercial products as their equipment of choice by the end of fiscal 2019 the implementation of our business optimization program will be nearly complete this important milestone lessens implementation risk as we end fiscal 2019 and enter fiscal 2020 it will also enable us to turn our full focus on operational excellence all of this positions us for significant improvements in cash generation improved earnings power as we move into the next fiscal year the increase in demand for our commercial products is due at least in part to our success in expanding global distribution we are building strong stronger relationships with oems who increasingly recognize the value of partnering with a global leader in power we are also forging stronger ties with rail houses including bose the leading company of its kind in europe which are specifying vanguard engines in the products they provide to their customers in construction and infrastructure these investments in market development which are ongoing will continue to pay dividends well into the future also in response to increasing demand we are expanding production capacity at our jobsite manufacturing facility to be better able to satisfy the volume requirement of rental houses by the end of this calendar year we will have installed new painting capacity and welding stations which will improve efficiency as well as improve responsiveness to customer demands we are also investing in product upgrades for our standby generator business which has experienced strong growth as a result of stronger dealer network and our success in making it easy to do business with briggs stratton our investments are also consistent with our goal of remaining responsible stewards of capital in addition to continuing to invest in organic growth including maintaining a robust culture of user driven problem solving our near term priority is to reduce debt so that when opportunities arise we are well positioned to supplement internal growth with acquisitions that expand our portfolio of commercial products where we see opportunities to leverage our manufacturing footprint and global scale to create value our recent acquisitions of ground logics spreader sprayers and hurricane ride on blowers are good examples of our product our focus on products that fill out the commercial landscapers trailer both acquisitions are performing well fiscal 2019 has proven to be a year filled with some unusual market activity combined with some start up inefficiencies associated with our business optimization program accordingly we thought it would be useful to provide our preliminary estimates regarding an our expected results beyond this fiscal year we have recently completed the annual update of our long range plan and we are very optimistic about the future our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2020 contemplate meaningful sales and earnings improvement we project net sales for fiscal 2020 to be in the range of 1 98 billion to 2 03 billion which contemplates an increase of over 6 from the fiscal 2019 sales outlook range we expect continued robust growth in commercial sales and a rebound of residential sales in europe as market conditions normalize along with a return to normal service parts throughput in north america we also expect that the residential lawn and garden market in the u s will benefit next season for former sears consumers migrating to new retail outlets i should add that our net sales estimates for 2020 assume normal growing conditions for the remainder of 2019 season and the 2020 season globally our 2020 estimates for diluted earnings per share are in a range of 1 20 to 1 40 per share which is a substantial improvement from expected results in fiscal 2019 in addition to the margins on the expected sales growth as well as a higher anticipated manufacturing volumes we also expect fiscal 2020 earnings to benefit from a recovery of the vast majority of inefficiencies that we experienced in 2019 as well as approximately 15 million of incremental benefits from business optimization program savings partially offsetting the expected earnings improvements is our expectation that production levels will be tempered in fiscal 2022 to lower working capital levels and improved cash flow we also expect approximately 0 07 of headwind associated with our frozen pension plan in fiscal 2020 based on current estimates as you can see from our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2020 we are optimistic about our future we will update these estimates when we provide our fiscal 2020 outlook in august after the completion of the fiscal after the completion of fiscal 2019 when we ll have better visibility on the progress of the current season we worked hard this year laying the foundation to make briggs stratton a better company with more diverse revenue streams in higher growth higher margin areas the business optimization program has been a big undertaking that is instrumental in helping build the foundation for a long term sustainable growth while we are disappointed by our near term profitability we are not discouraged about our future the strategy is right we are seeing our way through the difficult near term market headwinds from weather related issues in australia and europe and from the sears bankruptcy in the u s we are now coming to the late innings of implementing our business optimization initiatives and we have a path to improve operational excellence and generate an attractive return on the investment we ll now open it up for questions questions and answers operator all right all right your first question comes from the line of tom hayes your line is now open tom hayes northcoast research analyst hi good morning gentlemen todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tom tom hayes northcoast research analyst hey todd i was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more color on the european market it sounds like continued headwinds you called out the channel inventory maybe higher than you d originally expected but kind of given your comments on the 2020 outlook you re expecting some modicum of recovery in the market just wanted to get a little bit more color on that todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah tom so what happened last year is just to take you back i mean there was a pretty severe drought in europe in fact what s interesting is we ve experienced droughts before but we ve really never seen droughts on two continents between europe and australia which we re managing our way through but it just creates for some interesting market dynamics but in europe when you look at what happened last year was very hot very dry the grass wasn t growing and we knew coming out of the season that inventories were elevated the issue is we didn t the market in europe is very fragmented and you have a fairly robust dealer channel and you have a whole bunch of retailers that are out there and so when we talk to the oems and we talk to retailers we had an idea of where the inventories might be but as the we entered the season this year the oems kind of discovered that they the inventories were elevated in the channel and when the season got to be got off to a pretty slow start because it was very cold in europe through march into early april the oems really they started pulling orders and ultimately we ve got one significant oem over in europe that s going to take two weeks off in the middle of the season to give you an idea that this took them by surprise so now you get into well a couple of things first off we look at i look a lot at things like ground moistured maps and everything else so when you re looking at ground moisture where the season ended last year and where it is now it s improved dramatically which tells me that as it warmed up now here over the last couple of weeks over in europe we re anticipating that the season is moving it s improving but with the elevated inventory levels that have been out there we think that there s going to an impact for the season now when you get into the next year unless something dramatic happens like another drought in europe during the season which we re not anticipating the inventory levels will certainly normalize and in fact could get to be a little bit too low because remember the european production is done here in the u s for us for engine so it takes time on the water to get it to europe if it s going to a european oem or engines go to china because there s chinese oems that are now also shipping into europe and so that s why when we think about the headwinds for the remainder of the season we don t think there s going to be much of a benefit to us if it does bounce back simply because of timing but when you look at now into 20 as inventories are expected to normalize maybe you get to be a little bit low we would then expect a comeback into 20 which is really contemplated in this preliminary guidance that we ve given you folks tom hayes northcoast research analyst ok great and then maybe secondly on your thoughts on the craftsman s mower rollouts at lowe s into your participation and kind of the outlook for 2020 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah it s well the rollout s been very encouraging it s not just on mowers but on pressure washers too and you re seeing that come through the results the changes that have been made at lowe s with inventory stocking level remember last year they took inventories way down for a whole host of reasons including the brand transition so what s playing out on the craftsman situation is exactly what we thought was going to happen and in fact maybe to even a little bit stronger than what we had anticipated so as we look into 20 i mean you re going to have the channel flow that you saw this year because of the fact that they were stocking up on this but when you look at the amount of advertising that s going on by lowe s and by others it s very encouraging in the u s this season so that s as we look into fiscal 2020 we would expect that craftsman situation will continue to play very strongly tom hayes northcoast research analyst great and maybe two quick ones for you mark one you kind of faded out a little bit there on your comment on the inventory reduction the timing and the amount and then could you provide any color on the amount of business optimization expenses we should think about for the fourth quarter mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah the inventory reduction from the third quarter to the year end we re estimating to be about 100 million that said overall working capital change decline should be pretty similar sequentially year over year from q3 into q4 all in and then secondly on business optimization our outlook was just somewhere around 2 million to 6 million of optimization costs in q4 tom hayes northcoast research analyst great thanks for your time mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group thanks tom operator your next question comes from the line of sam darkatsh your line is now open unknown speaker good morning todd and mark this is josh filling in for sam thanks for taking my questions todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning josh mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group good morning josh unknown speaker long term question first in the past you had given a margin goal of 8 given some of the external headwinds you ve been facing can you give us an update on what year you might be able to reach that level and what sorts of things might need to happen in order to get there todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we re josh we re still the target s still 8 and we never put a date on it we just said that was our long term goal and we ultimately don t believe that a lot of the external things that are happening today ultimately have an impact on the long term goal that we have of 8 so what needs to happen is we just need to finish up on the business optimization program continue to put out really great products on the commercial side continue to put out really great products on the residential side and we will see the growth happen and we will see the margins improve get back to operational efficiency and we ll be back on track driving to that 8 so really nothing has changed and nothing this year all the stuff we view as being generally transitory and with a few things as we pointed out in the next year s preliminary guidance starts to work its way through and so the 8 is still a target and the time frame is still consistent with where we ve been unknown speaker thanks and then regarding the fourth quarter guidance can you give us a sense mark of what is baked into the high and low end in terms of how the season unfolds mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah we roughly assume pretty normal weather and as we commented looking pretty good now in the fourth quarter so far for the u s and europe the thing that is a little bit more of a wildcard this year is just a bit of dynamics in the landscape from a standpoint of sears not playing the same presence it used to and so it s one less retailer in place compared to the past and there s also a little bit less we anticipate less oem walk more production in the fourth quarter as well compared to where they would be the past due to some transitions going on there so those are the things that could potentially call it suppress a little bit of the fourth quarter even given good lawn and garden conditions and then on the high end it really comes down to a lot of the commercial growth and we ve seen some very nice growth to date there and anticipate some nice volumes in the fourth quarter as well we also anticipate some catch up on our service parts business which is helpful to the bottom line as well and we continue as todd mentioned the pressure washers have been going very well with the craftsman launch too and we see some continued strength there unknown speaker thank you and then you said your priority for cash uses debt reduction could you talk about how you might think about addressing the refinancing the upcoming maturity mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah with our bonds our senior notes of 195 million come due about a year from this december and so we ve begun the process to think through what options we could have in order to give ourselves financial capacity and financial flexibility roughly by the end of this calendar year so that we d be in a position to then retire the senior notes at a time of our choosing prior to their due date so that s something that we started working on and we ll keep you updated as we go forward unknown speaker and then the last one from me i saw you continued with the 0 14 dividend any commentary you want to give on your current thoughts on the dividend todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer the dividend s 0 14 and we expect the dividend to remain at 0 14 and over time we ll go higher unknown speaker thanks good luck with the next quarter todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs your line is now open tim wojs baird analyst hey everybody good morning todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group hi tim tim wojs baird analyst i have a few questions i guess maybe just starting with north america what do you what does the plan include for the residential engine business to grow in fiscal 19 and preliminarily in fiscal 20 and if you want to take out craftsman for fiscal 19 that s fine mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group well the primary goal for our residential engine business is really to hold the good share we have in improved margins and that s something that we re going to certainly continue to work on as we go forward the other thing that is significant there is new product development and we have targeted innovation that we ve launched over the years and we anticipate having continued pieces of innovation that help us improve our share in the market around the globe because when we have very high share in the traditional channels and north america and europe and australia there s other growing areas as well in those market so that channels like online and other things like that where we believe we can pick up market share as those things grow so those would be some of the primary areas on residential growth as well as the fact that the market remains pretty historically depressed and the housing market has been awfully choppy of late but the fundamental still seems to exist that there isn t enough supply for the demand at the entry level housing and the entry level housing is particularly where you re going to buy a walk behind mower which could inure well into our benefit as that balance were to shake out when that happens don t know but we would project more normalization there into the future tim wojs baird analyst ok ok and then i guess when you think about kind of fiscal 2020 guidance today i mean how i guess could we just maybe talk about the thought process behind giving that and i guess i m asking you from the perspective of we re just kind of getting into the current season and as you know there s just a lot of things and moving parts weather inventories and things that can develop over the course of the next 15 months so i guess when you look out to fiscal 2020 today i guess what are the key pieces of visibility that you have to maybe give that guidance this morning todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer so tim let me first address your comment or maybe question on why did we do this this is not normal that we would give next year s guidance in q3 at the end of q3 and we don t expect do it into the future but given just the significant transitory items that occurred in 19 we felt it was important to give all of you folks and investors and potential investors a glimpse into how we think about next year and how we think about some of the items this year and the takeaway you should have for why we did it was we wanted to communicate that these items are transitory they re temporary they re not structural and ultimately there s just a lot of moving pieces in fiscal 19 fiscal 19 is really a transition year in a number of different ways that then happened to have a lot of market headwinds due to weather related items and so that s why we thought it was important to give you an idea of where we currently think fiscal 2020 may shake out you re absolutely right there are a number of different things that will happen with inventories and the season progressing and where europe is and that sort of thing and what we ll do is we ll update this guidance as we get into august the thought process behind it is that ultimately we expect to see really strong commercial growth again in 20 we re seeing it here in 19 we ve seen it for the last five years we ve had double digit cagr over the last five or six years in this category and you should understand that we expect to continue to see that we also expect to see a rebound in residential as it relates to things like the european market again australia is has been so severe that we think that there s going to be some inventory higher levels of inventory coming out of this season because remember their season is now finishing up and so we have some visibility there so ultimately the other thing you need to understand is that we expect the inefficiencies will go away and we expect that we will get business optimization benefits and so that was the purpose behind giving you fiscal 2020 preliminary guidance early i think it s important for you to understand that we believe these things are transitory and they re just simply not going to repeat in 20 and we are on track as it relates to the execution of our strategy and we are just encountering some things of this year that are unfortunate are disappointing but at the end of the day we re managing our way through them tim wojs baird analyst ok ok understood and then i guess as we look at free cash flow for fiscal 19 is there a way to kind of think about what free cash flow should be into maybe this year and as you kind of look into fiscal 2020 what the rough conversion might look like mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah this year we came into the capex we expect to be around 65 million for the year which was online with what we planned we do think that free cash flow is going to as we ve talked about last quarter going to be negative slightly negative this year just given some of the headwinds of the operating results combined with the ongoing spending that we ve done this last year to complete the bring the business optimization program to completion as we go forward it s our long term financial goal to be able to convert about 3 to 4 of net sales into free cash flow and we think that we can make a lot of progress in getting there in fiscal 2020 based upon our preliminary estimates for 2020 where we would certainly be positive and quite positive in order to turn around that free cash flow as a percent of sales and that s going to come with the anticipated improved earnings combined with our ability to manage working capital and that s one of the benefits of the erp upgrade that we did is we do think that that s going to help in managing particularly inventory as we start going into 20 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer and tim let me just add tim let me add onto that when you look at preliminary 2020 guidance it s lower than what consensus has now this is the first time we ve come out with our number and a lot of you ve got a number that s out there the thing you got to keep in mind is we expect in 20 we re going we re not going to produce as much as we originally would expect meaning we re going to be producing especially on the engine business lower levels than what would be considered to be normal and that has a drag obviously on eps however what s really important now is to get the working capital back in line with where it needs to be and continue to get that cash flow generation back to where we ve historically had it if not better and so as mark pointed out we ve got targets on what we expect for free cash flow and things like that we re still going to see a little bit of an impact of kind of rolling out business optimization which i now think about it in terms of how do we flow the cash so that s having a drag on earnings for preliminary 2020 but the whole point is we use as mark pointed out we use the system we work through the system to ultimately have better asset velocity in the business and so again 18 19 has been kind of more transition years and as we now get into 20 we start to really realize some of the benefits we have the savings that we have baked we told you about we re experiencing now but then it also comes back to how do we better manage working capital in the balance sheet and flow cash and so that why we re really really optimistic about this new system it provides us with some new and different tools we just got a we ve got it up it s actually working quite well with the exception of what i would consider to be the service parts things we talked about in a little bit of australia but when you look at the rest of the business the business is now being able to understand this new system we re adapting our processes to the system and we expect that we re going to reap some real benefit out of this as we roll into 20 and 21 tim wojs baird analyst ok ok and then the last piece i have is maybe just a little more bigger picture so if you look at the engines business maybe over just the last 10 years the segments revenue s down maybe 400 million gross profit is kind of also down but the margin is actually up since then and really just sg a has been kind of flat or so over that period of time and i guess my question is just given the lower revenue levels what s the reasoning behind sg a i guess still being at that same level it was 10 years ago because it i guess it implies that sg a per unit is up fairly materially over the last 10 years and i guess business optimization probably will help with some of that but if you could just talk a little bit about how we should think of sg a over time just because that really hasn t moved over the last 10 years thanks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so tim what we ve done is we ve reallocated a lot of resources within esg a that you don t necessarily see how we ve reallocated them because we don t report segments that way let me give you let me tell you what i mean so if you think about our enabling technologies the two big or three big ones two of which are really big in the engine business in the power business one is electronic fuel injection and the other is electrification and so when you think about what we do and who we are we re a power application company so we don t think of ourselves any longer as being an engine company we think of ourselves as a power company a power application company and so what we ve done is we ve reallocated resources from what would be 10 years ago the traditional internal combustion engine engineering if you will in some of the support functions and now we ve reallocated that to things like electronic fuel injection some iot and then on electrification and you re going to start see coming out this fall we expect some of these offerings now on the electrification side so you ll see us coming out with our own products that ll have be battery powered and suffice to say in our long range plan we just took our board through some of our product planning over the last two days there is a tremendous amount of momentum with regards to battery type applications now some of that it s going to be some time before some of that adapts because internal combustion engines are still the most economical way to get power however when you look at the opportunities we have in electrification to expand the scope of our business beyond what historically has been lawn and garden there s other markets that we can play in now there s other markets we re playing in with vanguard engines as well my point to you is that esg a may have been relatively level but the way we spend the esg a is dramatically different and we ve been allocating to areas where we can get tremendous return while still being that provider of power so whether it s an internal combustion engine going forward and internal combustion engines will be around for a long time and we ll also have the opportunity to have batteries so when you look at kind of where we re at that s why you re not seeing sg a come down because of the investments that we re making in the enabling technologies tim wojs baird analyst ok ok thanks for the time and good luck over the summer here todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tim operator your next question comes from the line of joe mondillo your line is now open joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst just regarding the 18 growth at the commercial business i was wondering if you could sort of not necessarily quantify what the sort of different buckets are generating but sort of obviously some bucket must be generating above 18 and probably below 18 so i m just wondering if you could sort of just hash through turf products turf engine industrial products not turf industrial engines are really making much of a movement at this point but if you could sort of just talk about that that d be great thanks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah joe if you think about over the last few years we ve seen double digit cagr growth and early on we were seeing jobsite growth pretty tremendous and the reason we start seeing jobsite growth being pretty strong was when we bought allmand back in 15 it was really focused on oil and gas and as the oil and gas market really didn t do very well then shortly after 15 we pivoted into other things meaning light towers and for construction and jobsites and things like that and we also got into air towable air towable power so early on when we started to see the momentum that was stronger but we saw momentum across the board over the last 12 months or so jobsite is still strong but not perhaps as strong as it was two years ago and where we ve seen just tremendous growth has been on the commercial mowers and we ve seen tremendous growth in commercial engines and so i would tell you it s pretty much across the board with more recently being skewed toward the engines business as well as the commercial mowers where jobsite continues to grow but perhaps not at the same pace as it had a few years ago joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst all right and is that just on the engine side i guess it sounds like that s definitely a strength of the near term at least is that engine placement and just new customer wins could you just talk about the engine growth that you ve seen todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer well i would tell you the growth is both on engines and commercial turf we ve seen our ferris mowers have been tremendous over the last few years and that has to do with better placement out in the markets we re signing up new dealers new distributors i would also tell you that we ve got new models out over the last year and a half or two years it s been up almost 50 in terms of new models on the engine side it s a combination of things one is we now have a better value proposition if you will we always had a strong value prop coming out of japan but now being closer to the market we re finding that people really are excited about the fact that we ve shortened up lead times and they can do they can we re easier to business with that way we ve also launched some new products over the last for years and if you look at our vanguard 200 single cylinder you look at our vanguard 400 that we ve launched we ve got two other models that will be coming out we continue to see we see continued growth in this area simply because we ve got a better value proposition as we move onshore the engines and we ve got a better product offering than what we ve had in the past because we ve launched these new products over the last few years so it s not just one area it s broad based commercial growth mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group weigh in on the commercial turf area you had in some of the bolt on acquisitions that todd commented on earlier like the hurricane blowers and ground logic spreader sprayer it s gone really well and helped us round up the trailer nicely for the professional mower joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst and just a follow up a last question regarding this as you ve rolled out all these new models and new products within commercial and then probably more importantly the tariffs and higher costs and everything related to that are the margins at commercial that s this 18 growth at commercial are the margins still i mean you ve said in the past 500 to 600 basis points higher than residential is it still that strong and if so i m assuming that the product mix shift to commercial i guess it s just being offset tremendously by all these inefficiencies that you ve talked about on your prepared remarks and the call itself todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah joe so when you look at the margins it s still as up to 500 basis points different that doesn t mean it s on every product but i would tell you that when you look at the product mix shift yes it s benefited the thing that i think people get confused by at times though is when you look at the residential business when we don t have throughput in the plants obviously it has a drag on margins so yeah we had some of the inefficiencies that we talked about that but i think the other thing that s really important to understand is that the residential side of the business when you look at a year like we re having with market headwinds in europe and australia you ultimately don t have the throughput coming into the business the other thing is margins in europe and australia are generally better than what we get here in the u s given the different market structures over there so i wouldn t hang it all on the inefficiencies that s not it it s partially it but it s not the full picture so i think it s important to kind of consider the market headwinds on the residential side that we don t expect will continue into next year that s why we re projecting the kind of bounce back that we re projecting joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then i guess to follow on your sort of throughput comment i totally understand that with the erp system and sort of how you re managing working capital and how you re managing the plants and production overall could you talk about and i m guessing some of this or a lot of it is actually baked in the benefits of business up but talk about sort of the benefits that you re how the business overall changes because obviously with all these weather events the last two years inventory got way out of whack and now you re sort of trying to recover and try to sort of improve things going forward but it sounds like going forward the whole system and the process and working capital and everything is going to change hopefully a huge amount for the better could you just sort of talk more about that mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group joe i think you hit on it because the other thing that certainly been the case in 2019 as we have a lot of things all going at once at the same time initiative wise and so that onto themselves they re all excellent things but then from an execution standpoint that s where a little bit of the inefficiencies popped out and that we just have a lot of people working pretty hard to execute these things and the point with some the 2020 preliminary outlook is to show you just how confident we are that that bounces back and we got our arms around it so indeed from both a working capital standpoint particularly around inventory inventory management we ve had to ramp a little bit when you think about going live with the erp we ve now gotten better even in a short period of time with managing inventory we have new tools within our warehouses to be much more precise with what s where and we will be able to drive that to manage lower levels from the working capital standpoint and then the benefit standpoint from the todd commented that we expect to get an incremental 15 million of benefits and business optimization in 2020 on top of the i ll call it 2 million to 3 million that i commented on that we re recognizing in 19 a little bit behind pacing wise where we thought we d be but still on track to get to the up to 40 million benefits by 2021 so that s pretty significant and then on top of that you get the commercial sales mix that you guys are talking about as well and you combine that with more normal utilization of the facilities and more normalized service part throughput which comes at a nice margin relative to the portfolio and you re absolutely right it s a very different business from a top line bottom line perspective joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok last question i know the call is extended pretty long i just wanted to make sure that i understand any anticipated headwinds for fiscal 20 and one being australia that i can think of if there s anything else your comments regarding australia seem to i thought maybe it contradicted a little bit it sounded like initially in the prepared remarks you sort of cited the elevated inventory is going to probably be a headwind as we go into fiscal 20 but then i thought todd you may have said to sort of the opposite so i m wondering about that headwind and are there any sort of other headwinds that you re sort of thinking about i know there s several tailwinds that you ve obviously covered on the call but anything else that you think could be at risk going into fiscal 20 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah let me just clarify on the australia situation we don t expect that there s going to be a big rebound we would expect and maybe i misspoke earlier we expect that there will be inventory hangover if you will elevated inventories coming out of the season in australia and so therefore that will have an impact where we won t see the kind of bounce back next year that we would expect to see in europe because europe we expect to see a bounce back next year but australia we don t let me just note a couple of other things to your question then mark can fill it out i would tell you the other things that you just need to remember are the fact that production levels again are going to be are not going to be back to what we consider to be normalized levels that will be a headwind because ultimately we want to make sure we re taking down working capital and we re cash flowing the business other things mark mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah the two other things really that we commented on were the pension expense and we do expect about 0 07 per share of pension headwinds going into 20 and that s nothing other than our anticipation of a lower asset return compared to where we ve been as we work down our glide path to derisk our pension volatility as one item and then the other thing is related to our early comments we made on the whole sears market transition you recall when we took out the 30 million of revenue in 2019 we said we didn t anticipate all of it to come back right away and so indeed as we start to estimate out to 2020 it seems to be playing out roughly along the lines of what we had anticipated it would but we still have some more time to go in the season and we ll be able to better judge that in august but we want to anticipate all the loss sears volume coming back in 2020 some of it would hangover and come back later likely 21 joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst right and that would be a net tailwind still but just not maybe the full tailwind that you saw in terms of headwind in fiscal 19 right mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah especially if you re comparing against how we started out at the beginning of this year with our estimates and the ramp rate then into 20 and 21 compared to 19 that s a change in circumstance of course joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst great ok all right thanks a lot thanks for taking my questions todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks joe operator your next question comes from the line of matthew your line is now open unknown speaker hey guys i m just trying to square some comments about your cash generation and i m having difficulty with so if you take kind of the midpoint of your 2020 guidance for sales and then you take the midpoint of that 3 to 4 of sales for as your cash flow goal that s like 70 million of cash flow potentially but you said you sort of want to work up to that which implies that 2020 actual cash flow generation is going to be less but on the other hand you re saying that maybe production is going to be low while you sort of work through some inventory so maybe there s some working capital at least or cash flow is actually higher like how do we square what potential for cash flow generation in 2020 is going to be mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah there s obviously some variables that ll have to play out but based on our estimates now we think we can get very close to our goal of that 3 to 4 conversion likely on the lower end of the range in 2021 and then it really comes down to some of the working capital management and timing that we can drive we think we have a good beat on things related to that we believe we have good control over capital spending and although our goal is 65 million a year of capital spending going forward we might even endeavor to try to do less than that if the opportunity arises so those are a couple of the big things that we are really working on hard to manage with that priority toward improving some delevering unknown speaker so along that front is the goal to use some of this cash flow generation over the next 15 quarters i m sorry 15 months to chip away that maturity before you go to refinance it with these continued open market purchases of the bonds mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group no i wouldn t necessarily say that specific our goal is more around our total net debt position and right now over the last 12 months or so our revolving credit agreement borrowings have been a little bit higher than they ve been in the past due to the operating performance and then just higher spending on initiatives and we ve also reduced a little bit of the senior notes over the last 12 months as well so we think about it more on the overall basis of the full debt and we d like to see the full debt relative to the earnings delever a bit with the use of the cash flow and then as i commented from a refinancing standpoint the whole thinking is that we just like to have good capacity and flexibility in place our goal would be by the end of the calendar year so that we could then retire the senior notes at a time of our choosing unknown speaker yeah so about that timing obviously if you let it go into calendar 2020 it becomes a current liability on your balance sheet which auditors may or may not approve of are you comfortable letting this maturity go into 2020 or do you intend to try to address it before calendar 2020 mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group really need to address that as we go through our whole financing options as we work through that in the upcoming couple of quarters and the like in getting toward that december 2020 we have i believe we have good options available to us and so we ll see where all of that goes but really i think the important part i d say i want to have good capacity and flexibility to the extent i can demonstrate i got capacity i think that eases the audit concerns and the like that you mentioned because it gives me the flexibility to take out the notes at a time of my choosing unknown speaker ok all right thanks very much todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this time please continue todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer all right well thank you very much for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again in august thanks operator duration 74 minutes call participants mark

will cover the first quarter performance of our two business segments hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection as most of you know both businesses are seasonal the majority of the revenue and operating profit is typically earned in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday selling season the first quarter is the smallest of the year and the first half is the smallest half but first quarter results were only slightly behind our expectations and we expect the first half to be in line with our previous outlook at hamilton beach brands revenue for the first quarter was 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million last year revenue growth in the u s consumer market was partially offset by decreases in some of the international consumer markets global commercial revenue was comparable to last year unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced revenue by 700 000 as the canadian dollar and mexican peso weakened against the u s dollar progress with our strategic initiatives continued to drive growth in new areas in the u s e commerce channel initiatives we put into place to address the challenges we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 were beneficial and e commerce sales increased significantly in the first quarter compared to last year sales increased for our only the best products which are sold under the weston and hamilton beach professional brands and the license to wolf gourmet and chi brands driven in part by a number of new products launched for each brand in 2018 gross profit margin decreased to 20 7 from 22 1 last year primarily due to higher spot ocean freight rates on routes from china to the u s as importers accelerated container deliveries ahead of impending tariff increases while we were prepared for the impact of tariffs and expected some level of container cost increases the size of the increase during our peak shipping period was difficult to offset we expect our full year 2019 gross margin percent will be comparable to 2018 and we expect sequential improvement in each of the remaining quarters this year operating profit was 1 6 million compared to eight 3 8 million last year primarily due to the higher freight costs and to increased sg a expenses for the legal and professional fees including patent litigation expense next i d like to provide additional details regarding the important progress we continue to make with our key long term growth drivers new product platforms introduced in 2018 90 in all will benefit us in 2019 and beyond this year we are introducing a similarly strong line up of new products including a full line of air fryers and pressure cookers and we expect to gain share in these new fast growing categories in the first quarter the hamilton beach brand continued to hold the no 1 unit share position in the u s small kitchen appliance industry in both brick and mortar and e commerce channels each of the only the best brands generated double digit growth last year and all of them benefited from new product introductions and expanded retail distribution which we expect will benefit us this year and beyond we re introducing additional new products this year including a wolf gourmet stand mixer a weston electric food mill and sous vide circulator two hamilton beach professional hand mixers and new chi irons we expect growth from each of the brands continued distribution channel expansion and growth and share growth in stores and online global e commerce continues to grow for small kitchen appliances success in this channel requires providing products at the right price strong ratings and reviews and meaningful engagement with online shoppers our objective is to grow faster than the e commerce rate in each market where we compete we continue to focus on providing best in class retailer support increasing engagement with end users and enhancing programs designed to make us the preferred partner globally our products generally earn online ratings of four stars and above and favorable reviews in 2019 we expect e commerce sales growth in all markets in our global commercial business we have experienced strong growth across the americas europe and asia in the past few years we expect that broader distribution of several newer products will generate incremental revenue in the coming years increasingly the e commerce channel is becoming more significant in the commercial marketplace for both food service and hospitality purchase decision makers in those markets are using the internet more each day to both research products and purchase products we ve invested in a leading way to provide a digital marketing platform while maintaining our presence in traditional channels in international markets we plan to continue to expand in canada and mexico as well as latin america brazil and china where we have full teams in place we re finalizing plans to enter the india market with a soft launch in the second quarter we continue to evaluate additional markets through direct participation or brand licensing revenue in all the international markets in which we participate is expected to grow in 2019 we believe that our leadership in satisfying unmet consumer needs will enable us to continue to excel at providing products that are specifically designed to meet unique consumer needs in particular global markets examples of such items include a removable reservoir iron for the consumers in brazil the hamilton beach professional high performance blender for consumers in china and the hamilton beach professional juicer mixer grinder for consumers in india we launched new products in new categories outside of the traditional kitchen appliances in 2017 and 2018 including compact refrigerators coffee airpots knife sharpeners laundry accessories kitchen and bathroom scales among others revenue from new categories is expected to grow in 2019 as we introduce more products and gain traction the e commerce channel in particular enables us to introduce new products quickly and relatively inexpensively and react on a timely basis to consumer responses to new offerings we re excited about the progress we are making toward our long term growth objectives of reaching 750 million to 1 billion in annual revenue and 9 to 10 operating profit margin over time our initiatives provide many paths to reaching our revenue goals while some of our initiatives are delivering faster growth than others all of them have shown momentum and we will build upon them in the coming years next i will discuss the kitchen collection segment in 2018 and in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection continued to make solid progress with initiatives to return to profitability by closing underperforming stores moving all stores to a one year lease term maintaining gross margins reducing expenses and managing working capital at the end of 2018 kitchen collection had 189 stores in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection closed 21 stores and currently plans to close an additional 10 stores by the end of the year with the majority of the closures occurring in the second quarter by the end of 2019 kitchen collection expects to have 158 stores at that time 85 of the stores will have a lease term of approximately one year greatly increasing operating flexibility to respond to low store profitability levels kitchen collection believes it can rightsize its store portfolio aggressively over the next year or two with a core group of 100 to 150 adequately profitable stores in favorable outlet mall locations store lease decisions will be based on store by store profitability in the first quarter kitchen collection generated revenue of 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million last year the decrease was due to the closure of underperforming stores and lower comparable store sales both of which reflected a continued downward trend in customer traffic while the gross margin rate was down from last year given the number of stores we closed in the quarter we believe kitchen collection delivered a very good performance in gross margin percent we expect the full year gross margin to be in line with 2018 kitchen collection reduced its operating loss compared to last year the operating loss was 3 7 million an improvement of 600 000 compared to the operating loss of 4 3 million last year as a result of store closures and corporate expense reductions kitchen collection reduced operating expenses by 2 2 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 as most of you know kitchen collection typically has a loss in the early quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the business so in the first half our goal is to reduce the loss versus the prior year as we execute our strategy and the team accomplished that even with a large number of stores closing we offset the cost of closing which includes things like severance clearance promotions travel costs to and from the stores etc we re encouraging we re encouraged that kitchen collection is on track with the strategy we have been communicating and that its performance is improving as always if foot traffic to the malls is in line with our expectations as it was in the first quarter then we should be able to lever our improved performance if foot traffic improves or declines meaningfully kitchen collection s performance will likely follow with that overview of our two segments i ll turn the call over to michelle who will discuss our consolidated results michelle mosier thank you greg and good morning everyone my comments will focus first on our consolidated results for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year since greg has already reviewed our two segments in detail my comments will be mostly high level after discussing our consolidated first quarter results i will discuss our outlook for 2019 consolidated revenue was 145 4 million compared to 146 6 million last year at hamilton beach brands revenue increased to 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million at kitchen collection revenue decreased to 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million consolidated gross profit was 34 7 million compared to 37 8 million last year as a percentage of revenue gross profit was 23 9 compared to 25 8 as greg said we expect full year gross profit margin in both segments to be comparable to 2018 consolidated selling general and administrative expenses were 36 5 million compared to 38 million last year the decrease was primarily due to expense reductions in kitchen collection partially offset by increased legal and professional service fees at hbb the consolidated operating loss was 2 1 million compared to an operating loss of 500 000 last year operating profit at hamilton beach brands was offset by an operating loss at kitchen collection consolidated net interest expense was 746 000 compared to 532 000 last year the increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding under hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection s revolving credit facility and higher average interest rate we recognize an income tax benefit of 800 000 on a loss before income taxes of 2 5 million an effective tax rate of 30 8 the effective tax rate increased from 25 9 for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to an insignificant one time tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to our non u s pension plan consolidated net loss was 1 8 million or 0 13 per diluted share compared to a consolidated net loss of 400 000 or 0 03 per diluted share for 2018 next i ll discuss cash flow consolidated use of cash before financing activities was 100 excuse me 51 million compared to 41 5 million last year at both segments efforts to lower inventory were successful however the benefit was more than offset by a change in accounts payable due to the timing of payments capital expenditures were 900 000 compared to 2 4 million last year the decrease was primarily due to lower capital spending related to hamilton beach brands software development costs total cash expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately 4 5 million at hamilton beach brands and 300 000 at kitchen collection the remaining planned capital expenditures are primarily for the development of our erp system and tooling for new products at hamilton beach brands the company had cash on hand of 1 7 million compared to 2 4 million last year debt was 94 2 million compared to 85 5 million the higher debt level was due to fund was used to fund working capital at hamilton beach brands we re focused on getting our inventory cash flow and debt back to our desired level with inventory being the key element given the large volume in the fourth quarter traditionally the post holiday period brings large swings in working capital between the first and second quarters inventory in the first quarter was down meaningfully compared to the 2018 first quarter and we expect that trend to continue we continue to work to improve our dso and dpo and now let me turn to our outlook hamilton beach brands expects its 2019 revenue to grow moderately as a result of the continued successful implementation of its strategic initiatives including new customer new consumer and commercial product introduction only the best placements and continued expansion in the e commerce channel and international markets revenue for each of the strategic initiatives is expected to be above 2018 full year operating profit is currently expected to increase moderately over 2018 including a decrease in the first half of the year and an increase in the second half of the year compared to 2018 the second half outlook may change as customer commitments for the fall holiday selling season are confirmed in the second and third quarters while it s too early to confirm the final picture we have encountered new unfavorable issues that will pull our outlook down hamilton beach brands expects cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 kitchen collection expects its full future performance to be closely aligned with customer traffic trends including any potential improvements or further declines for 2019 kitchen collection s revenue is expected to decrease compared to 2018 as a result of store closures and low comparable store sales as a result of progress with its initiatives to return to profitability including significant expense reduction kitchen collection expects its operating loss and use of cash before financing activities in 2019 to improve if customer traffic to stores is line with expectations as it was in the first quarter kitchen collection expects to be able to deliver its anticipated improved performance based on the outlooks for the hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection segments hamilton beach brands holding company expects 2019 net income to increase and cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly over 2018 that concludes our prepared remarks we ll now turn the line back to the operator for q a question and answer session operator your first question comes from the line of peter benedict from baird your line is open peter benedict i guess a couple of questions first just on the new categories you talked about the air fryers and pressure cookers coming just curious the timing when we should expect to see these in the market and is there any way to frame maybe the size of these categories relative to the broader market that s my first question scott tidey hey peter this is scott we have talked about air fryers we currently have two air fryers in the market today one under proctor silex and one under hamilton beach and we ve got three more that are coming in the third quarter so we ve got two different sizes out there right now i think a one and a half and a two and a half liter with some larger capacities coming in the back half of the year and we continue to see that category grow also to go after that category we see that we think that business will transfer a little bit into the air fry and oven category and so we also work on new product development for that space as well for the pressure cookers we ve got two pressure cookers coming out one in the second quarter late in the second quarter and one in the third quarter so again a couple of platforms there that we ll be able to go after that size of business that category has slowed down a little bit but we do feel like that there s a good opportunity for us to come out with the two products that we have we think we re priced competitively and we ll be able to get some decent distribution in the marketplace peter benedict the next one is just around in a private label which i know i think in the past you guys has been a big focus or even in this category necessarily but just curious i mean a lot of retailers working aggressively around private brands across their store curious kind of where you guys where your thought process is around private label maybe remind us what you ve done in the past and just how you re thinking about it going forward is it anything that s part of the plans that we should be thinking about a greg treppr so we this is greg so private label has been a part of small appliances for a long time and sort of it s a little different than some other categories and mainly because once you put a plug on something there are safety issues there are performance issues you need a product that cooks properly or works properly and then certainly making sure you re understanding consumer needs and coming up with products that meet those needs so what we sort of found is that the in the small appliance business our private label will fluctuate between the low single digits i m sorry low double digits to maybe 15 to 20 of the market but it has not pushed up past that in the past so we assume that will continue to be the case we definitely have participated with retailers in the past and we currently do work with retailers in some areas on brands that are protected brands for them we have some meaningful business with some retailers so for us it s certainly a part of our portfolio it s one of the services we want to provide but generally speaking if it stays in that 10 to 15 range we won t find a role for ourselves in a lot of the businesses given the cost structure that the retailers need so my our belief is that it will sort be something that we participate in but not tried here at least in the near term peter benedict greg so you re not seeing just like a notable change in some of your customers desire to kind of to build out private brands further is that fair a greg treppr that is fair yes we definitely many of our retail partners want a private label business as part of their portfolio for sure but that s sort of been the case for a long time so we don t see it changing in any way that s changing the whole industry scott tidey and peter this is scott i do think we see some retailers are looking for more exclusive items so we will create an item that might be for one particular retailer and have a different feature set or different for different retailers so there could be exclusives but it would be under our brand and not under a private label brand name peter benedict that s makes sense scott and then my last question just on the revenue outlook within hb i mean you re saying grow moderately now i think you were saying increase modestly my sense is that s an incrementally favorable comment but just wanted to clarify that and then just how do you think your 19 revenue plan compares to just the overall industry what is there anything going on from an industry standpoint that s noteworthy in terms of what you guys are seeing or expecting for growth in 2019 thank you a greg treppr sure so for the full year i think where we are right now with worrying about customer decisions and watching other markets going i think we kind of feel pretty much in line with what we talked about in the past so any small changes in wording has not been intentional for the full year view of things but so we think we re from what we know now we think we re in a position to grow as we learn more about placements and promotional support we ll adjust that outlook moving forward in the overall market i think what we ve seen is we ve done particularly well in a number of categories that we ve been in traditionally when you if you put pressure cookers and air fryers aside we ve held up very well and adjust to things like e commerce and things but we certainly are very focused on also entering that fast growing part of the market to participate there and that ties into the products scott brought up so for pressure cookers and multi cookers as they finished the year last year still very strong very big big share of business that to scott s point they are still growing and the growth has slowed noticeably however it s been a quarter or two not i think could sort of pick back up who knows certainly very popular products it s not rolling over it s not tanking so i think if the these fast growing categories all sort of flatten out maybe grow a little bit maybe decline a little bit we don t expect them to go through the roof again or tank but they sort of stay modestly growing and modestly declining yeah they could well i think will be in a position to keep up with the market and hopefully beat the trend if pressure cookers were to roll over in a big way because we the silver lining for not participating in that growth would have been that it wouldn t hurt us as it came down so we would probably be ahead of the market but i say as we stand right now we re assuming that it s going to sort of soften to a lower growth rate and our goal is to grow a little faster than the overall market operator our next question comes from the line of mitchell lolley from nixon capital your line is open mitchell lolley i was just wondering first if you guys could give a little bit more color on the accounts payable timing shift issue in the quarter a greg treppr sure as you go into mitchell this is greg as you go into the through the holiday season each year we have between we order in our inventory we have depending on the time of the inventory sometimes the retailer will have a big event in september october november depends on which ones we win sometimes they ll do direct import perhaps they will do through our warehouse system so that affects when we buy it therefore our payables are when we receive it and it s such a big part of the year that as that flows through the fourth quarter it impacts when all those elements the working capital are coming to fruition during first quarter second quarter and a lot of times this spills over into early second quarter so as we look forward we feel like we ve made good improvement on our inventory as michelle said and then as the payables work through the based on again the timing that we experienced in the fourth quarter it really will just sort of roll off naturally in the second quarter and be in line with what we thought so really we naturally have a late first quarter second quarter movement of some of these things receivables and payables and i think we re sort of at a little point here where it moved a little bit on us but it s just timing more than anything else mitchell lolley and then another question i had is i noticed that operating losses at kitchen collection were almost they re about 14 15 lower year over year is that a pace of year over year improvement in operating losses that you think could hold for the rest of the year a greg treppr well we don t give specific guidance in that front but last year was a performance we were not happy with and we ve the things we ve talked about doing closing stores and holding our margin in line and all those getting out of stores that are causing a loss we have a lot of that hard work coming to fruition this year so our really with foot traffic being the big wild card we could see continued positive improvement versus the loss all year long if the foot traffic as we said earlier gets better or gets worse it s going to change it pretty fast but we ve assumed some level of foot traffic decline and our goal is to keep working margin expenses etc to make sure we improve in 2019 over 2018 mitchell lolley you just mentioned that changes in foot traffic can have a pretty dramatic and quick increase on the results and that leads me to kind of my broader question which is why is it a good strategy in general to continue dragging around a money losing asset that will never earn its cost of capital a greg treppr well we ve talked in some of the past calls that we look at our business from a long term shareholder value improvement point of view and so as we look at all of our portfolio whether it s parts of the hamilton beach business or the kitchen collection business we re going to come up we re going to work a strategy that allows us to improve shareholder value over time so as we work to improve kitchen collection we could take steps today that would provide some short term news but wouldn t be the most shareholder friendly way to make the business move to a different place so what i will say is that we are being very focused and very deliberate and very strategic but also very cold about the steps we ve got to take to move both hb and kc to a better place and so our view is that we got to keep working at this year and getting it to a much better place so i think we don t view it as we re dragging things around but we definitely know that we need to get that business and our whole business to a better place to help increase shareholder value operator there are no more questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters greg treppr and just a few last comments so we are excited about the prospects for advancing our strategic initiatives in our hamilton beach brands segment and for making further progress with our strategy to rightsize our kitchen collection store portfolio as we ve communicated our company takes a long term view and we are committed to building shareholder value over the long term we remain focused on the innovation initiatives and investments that are needed for the long term success of the business and before signing off i d like to note that in june we are participating in the baird consumer technology and services conference in new york our

the call over to greg greg trepp president and chief executive officer thank you lou anne good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call my remarks will cover the first quarter performance of our two business segments hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection as most of you know both businesses are seasonal the majority of the revenue and operating profit is typically earned in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday selling season the first quarter is the smallest of the year and the first half is the smallest half but first quarter results were only slightly behind our expectations and we expect the first half to be in line with our previous outlook at hamilton beach brands revenue for the first quarter was 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million last year revenue growth in the u s consumer market was partially offset by decreases in some of the international consumer markets global commercial revenue was comparable to last year unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced revenue by 700 000 as the canadian dollar and mexican peso weakened against the u s dollar progress with our strategic initiatives continued to drive growth in new areas in the u s e commerce channel initiatives we put into place to address the challenges we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 were beneficial and e commerce sales increased significantly in the first quarter compared to last year sales increased for our only the best products which are sold under the weston and hamilton beach professional brands and the license to wolf gourmet and chi brands driven in part by a number of new products launched for each brand in 2018 gross profit margin decreased to 20 7 from 22 1 last year primarily due to higher spot ocean freight rates on routes from china to the u s as importers accelerated container deliveries ahead of impending tariff increases while we were prepared for the impact of tariffs and expected some level of container cost increases the size of the increase during our peak shipping period was difficult to offset we expect our full year 2019 gross margin percent will be comparable to 2018 and we expect sequential improvement in each of the remaining quarters this year operating profit was 1 6 million compared to eight 3 8 million last year primarily due to the higher freight costs and to increased sg a expenses for the legal and professional fees including patent litigation expense next i d like to provide additional details regarding the important progress we continue to make with our key long term growth drivers new product platforms introduced in 2018 90 in all will benefit us in 2019 and beyond this year we are introducing a similarly strong line up of new products including a full line of air fryers and pressure cookers and we expect to gain share in these new fast growing categories in the first quarter the hamilton beach brand continued to hold the no 1 unit share position in the u s small kitchen appliance industry in both brick and mortar and e commerce channels each of the only the best brands generated double digit growth last year and all of them benefited from new product introductions and expanded retail distribution which we expect will benefit us this year and beyond we re introducing additional new products this year including a wolf gourmet stand mixer a weston electric food mill and sous vide circulator two hamilton beach professional hand mixers and new chi irons we expect growth from each of the brands continued distribution channel expansion and growth and share growth in stores and online global e commerce continues to grow for small kitchen appliances success in this channel requires providing products at the right price strong ratings and reviews and meaningful engagement with online shoppers our objective is to grow faster than the e commerce rate in each market where we compete we continue to focus on providing best in class retailer support increasing engagement with end users and enhancing programs designed to make us the preferred partner globally our products generally earn online ratings of four stars and above and favorable reviews in 2019 we expect e commerce sales growth in all markets in our global commercial business we have experienced strong growth across the americas europe and asia in the past few years we expect that broader distribution of several newer products will generate incremental revenue in the coming years increasingly the e commerce channel is becoming more significant in the commercial marketplace for both food service and hospitality purchase decision makers in those markets are using the internet more each day to both research products and purchase products we ve invested in a leading way to provide a digital marketing platform while maintaining our presence in traditional channels in international markets we plan to continue to expand in canada and mexico as well as latin america brazil and china where we have full teams in place we re finalizing plans to enter the india market with a soft launch in the second quarter we continue to evaluate additional markets through direct participation or brand licensing revenue in all the international markets in which we participate is expected to grow in 2019 we believe that our leadership in satisfying unmet consumer needs will enable us to continue to excel at providing products that are specifically designed to meet unique consumer needs in particular global markets examples of such items include a removable reservoir iron for the consumers in brazil the hamilton beach professional high performance blender for consumers in china and the hamilton beach professional juicer mixer grinder for consumers in india we launched new products in new categories outside of the traditional kitchen appliances in 2017 and 2018 including compact refrigerators coffee airpots knife sharpeners laundry accessories kitchen and bathroom scales among others revenue from new categories is expected to grow in 2019 as we introduce more products and gain traction the e commerce channel in particular enables us to introduce new products quickly and relatively inexpensively and react on a timely basis to consumer responses to new offerings we re excited about the progress we are making toward our long term growth objectives of reaching 750 million to 1 billion in annual revenue and 9 to 10 operating profit margin over time our initiatives provide many paths to reaching our revenue goals while some of our initiatives are delivering faster growth than others all of them have shown momentum and we will build upon them in the coming years next i will discuss the kitchen collection segment in 2018 and in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection continued to make solid progress with initiatives to return to profitability by closing underperforming stores moving all stores to a one year lease term maintaining gross margins reducing expenses and managing working capital at the end of 2018 kitchen collection had 189 stores in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection closed 21 stores and currently plans to close an additional 10 stores by the end of the year with the majority of the closures occurring in the second quarter by the end of 2019 kitchen collection expects to have 158 stores at that time 85 of the stores will have a lease term of approximately one year greatly increasing operating flexibility to respond to low store profitability levels kitchen collection believes it can rightsize its store portfolio aggressively over the next year or two with a core group of 100 to 150 adequately profitable stores in favorable outlet mall locations store lease decisions will be based on store by store profitability in the first quarter kitchen collection generated revenue of 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million last year the decrease was due to the closure of underperforming stores and lower comparable store sales both of which reflected a continued downward trend in customer traffic while the gross margin rate was down from last year given the number of stores we closed in the quarter we believe kitchen collection delivered a very good performance in gross margin percent we expect the full year gross margin to be in line with 2018 kitchen collection reduced its operating loss compared to last year the operating loss was 3 7 million an improvement of 600 000 compared to the operating loss of 4 3 million last year as a result of store closures and corporate expense reductions kitchen collection reduced operating expenses by 2 2 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 as most of you know kitchen collection typically has a loss in the early quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the business so in the first half our goal is to reduce the loss versus the prior year as we execute our strategy and the team accomplished that even with a large number of stores closing we offset the cost of closing which includes things like severance clearance promotions travel costs to and from the stores etc we re encouraging we re encouraged that kitchen collection is on track with the strategy we have been communicating and that its performance is improving as always if foot traffic to the malls is in line with our expectations as it was in the first quarter then we should be able to lever our improved performance if foot traffic improves or declines meaningfully kitchen collection s performance will likely follow with that overview of our two segments i ll turn the call over to michelle who will discuss our consolidated results michelle mosier vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you greg and good morning everyone my comments will focus first on our consolidated results for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year since greg has already reviewed our two segments in detail my comments will be mostly high level after discussing our consolidated first quarter results i will discuss our outlook for 2019 consolidated revenue was 145 4 million compared to 146 6 million last

collection partially offset by increased legal and professional service fees at hbb the consolidated operating loss was 2 1 million compared to an operating loss of 500 000 last year operating profit at hamilton beach brands was offset by an operating loss at kitchen collection consolidated net interest expense was 746 000 compared to 532 000 last year the increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding under hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection s revolving credit facility and higher average interest rate we recognize an income tax benefit of 800 000 on a loss before income taxes of 2 5 million an effective tax rate of 30 8 the effective tax rate increased from 25 9 for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to an insignificant one time tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to our non u s pension plan consolidated net loss was 1 8 million or 0 13 per diluted share compared to a consolidated net loss of 400 000 or 0 03 per diluted share for 2018 next i ll discuss cash flow consolidated use of cash before financing activities was 100 excuse me 51 million compared to 41 5 million last year at both segments efforts to lower inventory were successful however the benefit was more than offset by a change in accounts payable due to the timing of payments capital expenditures were 900 000 compared to 2 4 million last year the decrease was primarily due to lower capital spending related to hamilton beach brands software development costs total cash expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately 4 5 million at hamilton beach brands and 300 000 at kitchen collection the remaining planned capital expenditures are primarily for the development of our erp system and tooling for new products at hamilton beach brands the company had cash on hand of 1 7 million compared to 2 4 million last year debt was 94 2 million compared to 85 5 million the higher debt level was due to fund was used to fund working capital at hamilton beach brands

increase significantly over 2018 that concludes our prepared remarks we ll now turn the line back to the operator for q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of peter benedict from baird your line is open peter benedict baird analyst hey guys good morning i guess a couple of questions first just on the new categories you talked about the air fryers and pressure cookers coming just curious the timing when we should expect to see these in the market and is there any way to frame maybe the size of these categories relative to the broader market that s my first question scott tidey senior vice president north america sales and marketing hey peter this is scott we have talked about air fryers we currently have two air fryers in the market today one under proctor silex and one under hamilton beach and we ve got three more that are coming in the third quarter so we ve got two different sizes out there right now i think a one and a half and a two and a half liter with some larger capacities coming in the back half of the year and we continue to see that category grow also to go after that category we see that we think that business will transfer a little bit into the air fry and oven category and so we also work on new product development for that space as well for the pressure cookers we ve got two pressure cookers coming out one in the second quarter late in the second quarter and one in the third quarter so again a couple of platforms there that we ll be able to go after that size of business that category has slowed down a little bit but we do feel like that there s a good opportunity for us to come out with the two products that we have we think we re priced competitively and we ll be able to get some decent distribution in the marketplace peter benedict baird analyst ok good that s helpful the next one is just around in a private label which i know i think in the past you guys has been a big focus or even in this category necessarily but just curious i mean a lot of retailers working aggressively around private brands across their store curious kind of where you guys where your thought process is around private label maybe remind us what you ve done in the past and just how you re thinking about it going forward is it anything that s part of the plans that we should be thinking about greg trepp president and chief executive officer so we this is greg so private label has been a part of small appliances for a long time and sort of it s a little different than some other categories and mainly because once you put a plug on something there are safety issues there are performance issues you need a product that cooks properly or works properly and then certainly making sure you re understanding consumer needs and coming up with products that meet those needs so what we sort of found is that the in the small appliance business our private label will fluctuate between the low single digits i m sorry low double digits to maybe 15 to 20 of the market but it has not pushed up past that in the past so we assume that will continue to be the case we definitely have participated with retailers in the past and we currently do work with retailers in some areas on brands that are protected brands for them we have some meaningful business with some retailers so for us it s certainly a part of our portfolio it s one of the services we want to provide but generally speaking if it stays in that 10 to 15 range we won t find a role for ourselves in a lot of the businesses given the cost structure that the retailers need so my our belief is that it will sort be something that we participate in but not tried here at least in the near term peter benedict baird analyst ok that s helpful greg so you re not seeing just like a notable change in some of your customers desire to kind of to build out private brands further is that fair greg trepp president and chief executive officer that is fair yes we definitely many of our retail partners want a private label business as part of their portfolio for sure but that s sort of been the case for a long time so we don t see it changing in any way that s changing the whole industry scott tidey senior vice president north america sales and marketing and peter this is scott i do think we see some retailers are looking for more exclusive items so we will create an item that might be for one particular retailer and have a different feature set or different for different retailers so there could be exclusives but it would be under our brand and not under a private label brand name peter benedict baird analyst ok that s makes sense scott and then my last question just on the revenue outlook within hb i mean you re saying grow moderately now i think you were saying increase modestly my sense is that s an incrementally favorable comment but just wanted to clarify that and then just how do you think your 19 revenue plan compares to just the overall industry what is there anything going on from an industry standpoint that s noteworthy in terms of what you guys are seeing or expecting for growth in 2019 thank you greg trepp president and chief executive officer sure so for the full year i think where we are right now with worrying about customer decisions and watching other markets going i think we kind of feel pretty much in line with what we talked about in the past so any small changes in wording has not been intentional for the full year view of things but so we think we re from what we know now we think we re in a position to grow as we learn more about placements and promotional support we ll adjust that outlook moving forward in the overall market i think what we ve seen is we ve done particularly well in a number of categories that we ve been in traditionally when you if you put pressure cookers and air fryers aside we ve held up very well and adjust to things like e commerce and things but we certainly are very focused on also entering that fast growing part of the market to participate there and that ties into the products scott brought up so for pressure cookers and multi cookers as they finished the year last year still very strong very big big share of business that to scott s point they are still growing and the growth has slowed noticeably however it s been a quarter or two not i think could sort of pick back up who knows certainly very popular products it s not rolling over it s not tanking so i think if the these fast growing categories all sort of flatten out maybe grow a little bit maybe decline a little bit we don t expect them to go through the roof again or tank but they sort of stay modestly growing and modestly declining yeah they could well i think will be in a position to keep up with the market and hopefully beat the trend if pressure cookers were to roll over in a big way because we the silver lining for not participating in that growth would have been that it wouldn t hurt us as it came down so we would probably be ahead of the market but i say as we stand right now we re assuming that it s going to sort of soften to a lower growth rate and our goal is to grow a little faster than the overall market peter benedict baird analyst ok fair enough all right thanks guys appreciate it greg trepp president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mitchell lolley from nixon capital your line is open mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst hi i was just wondering first if you guys could give a little bit more color on the accounts payable timing shift issue in the quarter greg trepp president and chief executive officer sure as you go into mitchell this is greg as you go into the through the holiday season each year we have between we order in our inventory we have depending on the time of the inventory sometimes the retailer will have a big event in september october november depends on which ones we win sometimes they ll do direct import perhaps they will do through our warehouse system so that affects when we buy it therefore our payables are when we receive it and it s such a big part of the year that as that flows through the fourth quarter it impacts when all those elements the working capital are coming to fruition during first quarter second quarter and a lot of times this spills over into early second quarter so as we look forward we feel like we ve made good improvement on our inventory as michelle said and then as the payables work through the based on again the timing that we experienced in the fourth quarter it really will just sort of roll off naturally in the second quarter and be in line with what we thought so really we naturally have a late first quarter second quarter movement of some of these things receivables and payables and i think we re sort of at a little point here where it moved a little bit on us but it s just timing more than anything else mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst ok and then another question i had is i noticed that operating losses at kitchen collection were almost they re about 14 15 lower year over year is that a pace of year over year improvement in operating losses that you think could hold for the rest of the year greg trepp president and chief executive officer well we don t give specific guidance in that front but last year was a performance we were not happy with and we ve the things we ve talked about doing closing stores and holding our margin in line and all those getting out of stores that are causing a loss we have a lot of that hard work coming to fruition this year so our really with foot traffic being the big wild card we could see continued positive improvement versus the loss all year long if the foot traffic as we said earlier gets better or gets worse it s going to change it pretty fast but we ve assumed some level of foot traffic decline and our goal is to keep working margin expenses etc to make sure we improve in 2019 over 2018 mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst you just mentioned that changes in foot traffic can have a pretty dramatic and quick increase on the results and that leads me to kind of my broader question which is why is it a good strategy in general to continue dragging around a money losing asset that will never earn its cost of capital greg trepp president and chief executive officer well we ve talked in some of the past calls that we look at our business from a long term shareholder value improvement point of view and so as we look at all of our portfolio whether it s parts of the hamilton beach business or the kitchen collection business we re going to come up we re going to work a strategy that allows us to improve shareholder value over time so as we work to improve kitchen collection we could take steps today that would provide some short term news but wouldn t be the most shareholder friendly way to make the business move to a different place so what i will say is that we are being very focused and very deliberate and very strategic but also very cold about the steps we ve got to take to move both hb and kc to a better place and so our view is that we got to keep working at this year and getting it to a much better place so i think we don t view it as we re dragging things around but we definitely know that we need to get that business and our whole business to a better place to help increase shareholder value operator there are no more questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters greg trepp president and chief executive officer ok thank you and just a few last comments so we are excited about the prospects for advancing our strategic initiatives in our hamilton beach brands segment and for making further progress with our strategy to rightsize our kitchen collection store portfolio as we ve communicated our company takes a long term view and we are committed to building shareholder value over the long term we remain focused on the innovation initiatives and investments that are needed for the long term success of the business and before signing off i d like to note that in june we are participating in the baird consumer technology and services conference in new york our presentation is scheduled for wednesday june 5 at 3 10 p m and we hope to see

and chief executive officer today s presentation and our answers to your questions include forward looking statements these statements are based on our current assessment of the markets in which we

approximately two hours after the end of this call now here s todd todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today yesterday we reported fiscal 2019 third quarter results which reflected sears related weakness in north america as expected prolonged drought related softness in europe and australia and inefficiencies mainly related to the ramp up of our new commercial manufacturing operations while we were disappointed with the results the quarter held some meaningful bright spots mainly continued strong sustainable share gains in commercial engines and products the conversion of all remaining ferris mower production to our new plant and improved order fill rates on our service and parts business we were disappointed in the overall financial performance also as a result we announced a revision to our guidance for the 2019 fiscal year despite the near term headwinds we remain encouraged about the foundation of our business and remain confident in achieving our long term financial goals sales for the fiscal 2019 third quarter were down 24 million or 4 to 580 million product sales were strong up 26 million or approximately 10 engine sales declined 48 million or 13 with more than half of the sales declined due to the due to a reduction in international shipments of residential engines in europe retailers and dealers have been cautious in their buying patterns and have significantly slowed their seasonal ordering to work through current inventories following last season s drought ground moisture has significantly improved after the historic drought last season while spring temperatures have been somewhat cooler than normal however we along with several of our oem partners have had underestimated the level of channel inventory that remained at the end of last season the elevated inventories coupled with a lack of early spring season has caused retailers to be very cautious in their early season ordering patterns in australia historically severe drought conditions continue to the majority of the lawn and garden season which significantly hampered sales we had expected some late season rebound in order activity in the third quarter but the rebound failed to materialize given the continued dry conditions in north america the market for engines has played out much as expected as previewed last quarter we expected the sears bankruptcy to cause near term disruption in the market primarily in the third quarter as consumers migrate their shopping patterns and adjust to this change in the retail landscape we estimated the impact of the exit at approximately 25 million of sales in the third quarter which is predominantly comprised the sales of engines and service parts at the same time engine placement for other north america retailers were strong shipments to fill stores following brand transitions were particularly robust with early indications that consumers are responding positively to the brand changes the spring season here in the u s got off to a cooler than normal start in march which somewhat constrained our commercial mover growth and led to lower residential riding mower sales in the third quarter within our products segment temperatures improved in april and we ve seen more robust sell through to date which is encouraging we continued to achieve strong pressure washer sales growth in the third quarter due to our launch of craftsman branded units at lowe s this spring as well as elevated pollen levels in the southern u s the real strength in our business continued to be the commercial categories on a trailing 12 month basis sales of commercial products and engines grew 18 and accounted for 30 of total sales the strength was broad based including growth in job site ferris commercial mowers and hurricane stand on blowers which we acquired last year this success is a direct result of offering our customers demonstrably better more innovative products that make the end user more productive and deliver a lower total cost of ownership the growth in commercial demonstrates that we are truly winning in the marketplace and making significant sustainable share gains across all lines we have expanded distribution with increases in the number of dealerships distributors and rental houses for job site and commercial turf products over the past two fiscal years for example we have secured more than 60 new oem placements and wins for our commercial engines and turf products the quality of our products has led to substantial growth with multiple established oems as well third quarter results also include the impact of lower engine sales in production volumes unfavorable sales mix and inefficiencies which contributed to reduce profitability mark will provide more specifics on each but i would like to cover the inefficiencies during the quarter our results included approximately 8 million of inefficiencies primarily related to the start up of our business optimization initiatives operational excellence is a cornerstone of how we run the business consequently we are disappointed in our performance this past quarter and have worked diligently to implement solutions to restore operational excellence going forward the inefficiency breakdown in three areas freight costs incremental labor and production speed i would like to briefly comment on each first elevated freight spending accounted for approximately 40 of the 8 million in inefficiencies a large portion of freight spending was driven by unusual market conditions in which the rate to ship containers from china to the u s nearly doubled for a period of time during the quarter this spike in shipping rates was driven by a surge in global demand on the china to u s shipping routes the container rates dropped back in line by the end of the quarter the remainder of the elevated freight spend we incurred related to the start up of our projects to bring production of vanguard engines onshore and support our commercial mower growth we incurred elevated freight charges caused by supply chain issues in asia resulting in the need to air freight components to allow us to meet customer demand we also experienced increased costs for outbound freight to ship mowers to dealers and distributors driven by a shift in orders during the quarter to our newest models for which we had not been able to build the necessary inventory accordingly we were not able to fully consolidate shipments which increased cost despite the higher outbound shipping costs we met our commitments to our dealers by maximizing order fill rates at a crucial time in the selling season for commercial mowers and other products we have already taken actions to remediate these start up issues and anticipate reduced freight inefficiencies in the fourth quarter we do not expect the vast majority of freight inefficiencies to repeat in fiscal 2020 second incremental labor in the form of overtime and temporary workers accounted for another 40 of the total inefficiencies as we approach the peak season we opted to increase the temporary manpower in certain of our locations particularly within our north america service distribution center to ensure that we could meet peak season demand we have implemented plans to reduce the heightened labor in the fourth quarter as we gain more familiarity and rhythm with the new process following the upgrade of our erp system based on this we do not expect the vast majority of labor inefficiencies to repeat in fiscal 2020 the third and remaining 20 of inefficiencies in the quarter pertain to the ramp up of vanguard engine production at our u s facilities which fell short of our goals throughout the third quarter however we improved throughput and are now positioned to substantially achieve our original planned build rate for the fourth quarter we have also had the benefit of continued manufacturing volume from our japanese joint venture so as to ensure that we have plenty of vanguard engines to keep pace with the fast growing customer demand through the onshore in transition you can be assured that addressing the inefficiencies and restoring operational excellence has our full attention you can also be assured that we are going to do the right things to meet customer commitments the work our team has put in to improve the operations today has already driven up service parts fulfillment rates and we ve been able to keep up with the fast growing customer demand for our commercial engines and mowers this significant progress gives us great confidence we will drive improvements in closing out fiscal 2019 and we will drive substantial profitability improvements going into fiscal 2020 i would like to add that despite these near term headwinds we remain very encouraged about our long term prospects we have laid a solid foundation to accelerate growth improve profitability and drive higher capital returns we are already demonstrating the success for our strategy to diversify our business into higher margin commercial products and we remain confident that our business optimization program would deliver upwards of 40 million in pre tax cost savings by fiscal 2021 now here is mark to walk through our financial results for fiscal 2019 third quarter and provide details on the revised earnings outlook mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group thanks todd i ll begin by touching on some highlights from the financial results third quarter gaap consolidated net income of 8 million included business optimization costs and acquisition related charges of 6 6 million excluding these costs third quarter adjusted net income was 14 6 million or 0 34 per diluted share down from 0 84 for last year s adjusted eps the engines and product segments recognized 5 2 million and 4 7 million of pre tax charges respectively engines segment sales for the third quarter were 336 million a decrease of approximately 48 million from the prior year engine unit sales were approximately 2 1 million a decrease of 18 or approximately 456 000 engines engine sales decreased primarily for the reasons todd mentioned earlier namely the decline in shipments for sears and drought related softness in europe and australia in addition at our fiscal second quarter we had commented that 20 million of sales had accelerated from the third quarter for sequentially earlier production this season largely in support of brand transitions service parts sales were down slightly in the third quarter partly offsetting the reduction in sales vanguard commercial engine sales grew by nearly 10 in the third quarter in addition higher pricing was in place to offset higher material costs and tariffs the engines segment adjusted gross profit margin of 21 8 was down from 25 4 a year ago reflecting unfavorable sales mix lower production volumes and an increase in manufacturing inefficiencies unfavorable sales mix led to a decline in margins of approximately 160 basis points the mix change was due to proportionately less sales of engines to customers outside the u s which typically contained higher margins and lower service parts sales quarterly engine production volume was 1 7 million units down 14 from last year s third quarter production of 2 million units the lower production had an unfavorable impact on margins of approximately 130 basis points which is roughly in line with what we had anticipated total engine inventories at the end of the fiscal 2019 third quarter were approximately 1 7 million units which is consistent with a year ago inventory dollars are higher year over year due to proportionately more large engines and inventory and higher components on hand to support the onshoring of vanguard engines we expect the higher inventory levels of commercial engines to decrease before the end of the fiscal year and into early fiscal 2020 as we complete the onshoring program inefficiencies drove 100 basis points of the margin decline as todd detailed earlier the elevated freight costs higher labor costs and our vanguard production ramp up following behind the planned rate primarily drove to the inefficiencies and we are making good progress on actively abating the issues engines segment adjusted esg a declined by 3 million primarily from lower employee related expenses engines segment adjusted income of 28 million was down from 15 6 million a year ago product segment net sales for the third quarter increased by 26 million or 11 the increase was primarily due to 16 growth of commercial sales resulting from higher sales of ferris mowers and growth from the hurricane acquisition residential sales grew slightly on higher volumes of standby generators and pressure washers partially offset by lower sales of portable generators and riding mowers following cool spring temperatures in the u s outside the u s we achieved higher sales in brazil sales also benefited from higher prices to offset cost inflation adjusted gross profit margin in the product segment of 10 2 for the quarter was down from 13 8 for the same quarter last year largely due to inefficiencies and unfavorable sales mix inefficiencies were responsible for approximately 180 basis points for the margin decline were caused by the items todd detailed earlier including elevated freight costs and higher labor costs in addition to the inflated overseas container costs todd mentioned we incurred higher domestic outbound freight costs as we refined our processes to optimize loads from our plants to dealers and distributors the task of optimizing freight and manufacturing labor for our commercial lawn and garden products was complicated in the third quarter by the rapid growth in customer demand and the plant transition all remaining production of our ferris mowers transitioned to the new plant early in the third quarter and we are pleased with the build rate and product quality similar to the engines segment the product segment incurred higher labor costs to improve the throughput of service parts to support the peak season as todd mentioned earlier we have a clear line of sight to the causes of the inefficiencies and are actively working to abate the issues unfavorable sales mix drove approximately 170 basis points of margin decline in the third quarter for the products segment the mix change was driven by robust sales growth of pressure washers due to elevated pollen levels of the spring and brand transitions at retail lower sales of products with comparatively higher margins included lower sales of portable generators from fewer springtime storms and lower replenishment following a less active storm season this past fall in addition as todd mentioned earlier sales of residential riding mowers through our dealer channel were lower year over year due to the cool march weather higher sales of commercial mowers partially offset the unfavorable margin mix increases in material and tariff costs were largely offset by pricing product segment adjusted esg a expenses were down 1 9 million primarily from a reduction in employee compensation expenses the segment s adjusted loss for the quarter was 1 million compared with the adjusted income of 3 7 million for the third quarter of 2018 on the balance sheet net debt was 383 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter up from 279 million a year ago but down 93 million from the end of the second quarter in addition to funding internal projects to support our business optimization program our primarily primary goal for cash is to continue to pay down debt to strengthen the balance sheet further we expect to reduce inventory by over 100 million from current levels by the end of the fiscal year last 12 month cash provided by operating activities was 7 million and last 12 month free cash flow was negative 65 million depreciation and amortization for the quarter of 15 million was lower than capital expenditures of 12 million largely due to the winding down of investments in our business optimization program we continue to estimate that we will spend 65 million on capital spending this year a decrease of nearly 40 million from last year at the end of the quarter last 12 month average funded debt was 402 million and last 12 month ebitda was 131 million both was defined by our credit agreement resulting in a leverage ratio of 3 06 times which is within our debt covenant although leverage is elevated from where we have been historically we project that improved earnings and lower spending due to the completion of a business optimization program will result in decreasing leverage in future quarters before i turn the call back over to todd for his closing remarks let me spend a moment on the fiscal 2019 full year and fourth quarter outlook for the full year we expect sales in the range of 1 86 billion to 1 91 billion a decrease of approximately 40 million from our previous outlook approximately 30 million of the downward revision is due to weather related market conditions in australia and europe we incurred the majority of this revision in the third quarter with approximately 10 million of the outlook reduction expected to impact the fourth quarter given normal weather conditions this season we would expect elevated channel inventories in europe to normalize through the course of this season which would support a rebound in engine sales next year given the prolonged and severe nature of the drought in australia we believe that channel inventories are elevated and will not support a significant rebound in our sales next year there the australian market is substantially smaller however than the u s and europe markets in the u s we now estimate that service part sales will be lower than previously expected by approximately 10 million although we have substantially improved the throughput of our service distribution center and have improved fill rates we do not believe we ll fully restore our safety stock levels prior to the end of fiscal year we expect to normalize channel inventory early in the summer following the peak shipping season we also anticipate less favorable sales mix compared to our prior outlook following the cool start to spring in the third quarter we expect the growth of lawn and garden equipment to be slightly less than what was contemplated on our previous outlook offsetting this from a top line perspective we expect higher pressure washer sales given the amount of pollen growth in the southern u s and the success of the craftsman brand launch at lowe s these factors are expected to be neutral on sales and unfavorable to margins in response to the anticipated lower engine sales due to market conditions in australia and europe we plan to decrease engine production in the fourth quarter by 350 000 units compared to what we previously plan to produce we use production as expected to lower pre tax income by approximately 4 million to 5 million total engine production for fiscal 2019 is now expected to be 5 9 million units or about 1 million less than what was produced a year ago we had anticipated producing nearly 6 8 million units at the outset of fiscal 2019 but have since lowered production in response to transitory market conditions including the sears exit from the market combined with weather related softness in australia and europe because we have lowered production this year we expect to end fiscal 2019 with fewer engines than last year this reduction will help us manage working capital and should create the need for some rebound in production levels during fiscal 2020 taken together the impact of lower sales unfavorable sales mix and reduced production net of offsetting spending reductions is expected to be a reduction of 22 million pre tax or 0 40 per diluted share to our fiscal 2019 outlook in addition we expect start up inefficiencies associated with our business optimization initiatives net of spending to reduce our full year diluted earnings per share by approximately 30 million pre tax or 0 25 per diluted share although we believe we have addressed the majority of the causes driving inefficiencies we expect fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by inefficiency costs of 4 million to 5 million a portion of these costs were actually incurred prior to the fourth quarter but will only be recognized in the fourth quarter upon sale of the inventory as a result the inefficiency costs incurred in the fourth quarter are expected to be down substantially from what was recognized in the third quarter as indicated in last evening s earnings release we expect fiscal 2019 equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates to be 11 5 million and we expect interest expense to be 28 5 million the consolidated tax rate expected to be 10 to 12 due to the change in expected pre tax earnings for the full year we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of 0 45 to 0 65 per share lastly regarding the fourth quarter the midpoint of our sales guidance projects an increase of 4 compared to last year s fourth quarter as a reminder sales in last year s fourth quarter were negatively impacted by poor springtime weather in the u s as well as channel inventory reductions these factors were partially mitigated by the benefit we received last year due to shipping approximately 20 million of sales to build customer safety stock in advance of our erp upgrade go live which will not repeat for the current year despite a slow start in march we are optimistic regarding the u s lawn and garden season and are encouraged by april retail activity to date somewhat temporary fourth quarter sales growth our anticipated headwinds associated with the europe market conditions and their exit of sears here and the exit of sears here in the u s accordingly we expect engine sales in the fourth quarter to be relatively flat to last year we expect the fourth quarter consolidated gross margin rate to be lower than last year s fourth quarter margin rate by a little over 100 basis points the decrease is due to our anticipation of producing approximately 400 000 fewer engines in the fourth quarter than a year ago as mentioned previously we also expect 4 million to 5 million of inefficiency charges will impact fourth quarter earnings together lower production and inefficiencies are expected to pressure fourth quarter margins by approximately 170 basis points we expect to achieve offsets to these margin pressures from a favorable sales mix which will include higher commercial sales as well as higher service part sales and savings of approximately 2 million from our business optimization program we expect fourth quarter adjusted esg a spending to be slightly lower than the fourth quarter last year now let me turn the call back over to todd for some closing remarks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer third quarter results had several encouraging developments supporting the fundamental soundness of our long term strategy we continue to make significant progress in the diversification of our business into higher growth commercial products and engines customers are clearly responding to the innovation we are bringing to the market with products that deliver greater up time and make the professional more productive the same attention to user driven innovation is driving greater adoption of our engines while we have clearly faced some near term challenges we are making progress on several fronts which strengthens our optimism and confidence about our future and our ability to create value for our shareholders on our business optimization program we have made significant progress on adapting business processes to our erp upgrade particularly in our service parts area which we expect to be substantially back to normal operations this summer in commercial engines demand remained strong as volumes increased at our auburn alabama plant from the onshoring of production from our joint venture and product quality remains high our statesboro georgia facility continues to be in ramp up mode and is expected to be in full production by this summer similarly our new commercial mower plant in upstate new york is performing well as professional landscapers are increasingly choosing ferris and other briggs commercial products as their equipment of choice by the end of fiscal 2019 the implementation of our business optimization program will be nearly complete this important milestone lessens implementation risk as we end fiscal 2019 and enter fiscal 2020 it will also enable us to turn our full focus on operational excellence all of this positions us for significant improvements in cash generation improved earnings power as we move into the next fiscal year the increase in demand for our commercial products is due at least in part to our success in expanding global distribution we are building strong stronger relationships with oems who increasingly recognize the value of partnering with a global leader in power we are also forging stronger ties with rail houses including bose the leading company of its kind in europe which are specifying vanguard engines in the products they provide to their customers in construction and infrastructure these investments in market development which are ongoing will continue to pay dividends well into the future also in response to increasing demand we are expanding production capacity at our jobsite manufacturing facility to be better able to satisfy the volume requirement of rental houses by the end of this calendar year we will have installed new painting capacity and welding stations which will improve efficiency as well as improve responsiveness to customer demands we are also investing in product upgrades for our standby generator business which has experienced strong growth as a result of stronger dealer network and our success in making it easy to do business with briggs stratton our investments are also consistent with our goal of remaining responsible stewards of capital in addition to continuing to invest in organic growth including maintaining a robust culture of user driven problem solving our near term priority is to reduce debt so that when opportunities arise we are well positioned to supplement internal growth with acquisitions that expand our portfolio of commercial products where we see opportunities to leverage our manufacturing footprint and global scale to create value our recent acquisitions of ground logics spreader sprayers and hurricane ride on blowers are good examples of our product our focus on products that fill out the commercial landscapers trailer both acquisitions are performing well fiscal 2019 has proven to be a year filled with some unusual market activity combined with some start up inefficiencies associated with our business optimization program accordingly we thought it would be useful to provide our preliminary estimates regarding an our expected results beyond this fiscal year we have recently completed the annual update of our long range plan and we are very optimistic about the future our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2020 contemplate meaningful sales and earnings improvement we project net sales for fiscal 2020 to be in the range of 1 98 billion to 2 03 billion which contemplates an increase of over 6 from the fiscal 2019 sales outlook range we expect continued robust growth in commercial sales and a rebound of residential sales in europe as market conditions normalize along with a return to normal service parts throughput in north america we also expect that the residential lawn and garden market in the u s will benefit next season for former sears consumers migrating to new retail outlets i should add that our net sales estimates for 2020 assume normal growing conditions for the remainder of 2019 season and the 2020 season globally our 2020 estimates for diluted earnings per share are in a range of 1 20 to 1 40 per share which is a substantial improvement from expected results in fiscal 2019 in addition to the margins on the expected sales growth as well as a higher anticipated manufacturing volumes we also expect fiscal 2020 earnings to benefit from a recovery of the vast majority of inefficiencies that we experienced in 2019 as well as approximately 15 million of incremental benefits from business optimization program savings partially offsetting the expected earnings improvements is our expectation that production levels will be tempered in fiscal 2022 to lower working capital levels and improved cash flow we also expect approximately 0 07 of headwind associated with our frozen pension plan in fiscal 2020 based on current estimates as you can see from our preliminary estimates for fiscal 2020 we are optimistic about our future we will update these estimates when we provide our fiscal 2020 outlook in august after the completion of the fiscal after the completion of fiscal 2019 when we ll have better visibility on the progress of the current season we worked hard this year laying the foundation to make briggs stratton a better company with more diverse revenue streams in higher growth higher margin areas the business optimization program has been a big undertaking that is instrumental in helping build the foundation for a long term sustainable growth while we are disappointed by our near term profitability we are not discouraged about our future the strategy is right we are seeing our way through the difficult near term market headwinds from weather related issues in australia and europe and from the sears bankruptcy in the u s we are now coming to the late innings of implementing our business optimization initiatives and we have a path to improve operational excellence and generate an attractive return on the investment we ll now open it up for questions questions and answers operator all right all right your first question comes from the line of tom hayes your line is now open tom hayes northcoast research analyst hi good morning gentlemen todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning tom tom hayes northcoast research analyst hey todd i was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit more color on the european market it sounds like continued headwinds you called out the channel inventory maybe higher than you d originally expected but kind of given your comments on the 2020 outlook you re expecting some modicum of recovery in the market just wanted to get a little bit more color on that todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah tom so what happened last year is just to take you back i mean there was a pretty severe drought in europe in fact what s interesting is we ve experienced droughts before but we ve really never seen droughts on two continents between europe and australia which we re managing our way through but it just creates for some interesting market dynamics but in europe when you look at what happened last year was very hot very dry the grass wasn t growing and we knew coming out of the season that inventories were elevated the issue is we didn t the market in europe is very fragmented and you have a fairly robust dealer channel and you have a whole bunch of retailers that are out there and so when we talk to the oems and we talk to retailers we had an idea of where the inventories might be but as the we entered the season this year the oems kind of discovered that they the inventories were elevated in the channel and when the season got to be got off to a pretty slow start because it was very cold in europe through march into early april the oems really they started pulling orders and ultimately we ve got one significant oem over in europe that s going to take two weeks off in the middle of the season to give you an idea that this took them by surprise so now you get into well a couple of things first off we look at i look a lot at things like ground moistured maps and everything else so when you re looking at ground moisture where the season ended last year and where it is now it s improved dramatically which tells me that as it warmed up now here over the last couple of weeks over in europe we re anticipating that the season is moving it s improving but with the elevated inventory levels that have been out there we think that there s going to an impact for the season now when you get into the next year unless something dramatic happens like another drought in europe during the season which we re not anticipating the inventory levels will certainly normalize and in fact could get to be a little bit too low because remember the european production is done here in the u s for us for engine so it takes time on the water to get it to europe if it s going to a european oem or engines go to china because there s chinese oems that are now also shipping into europe and so that s why when we think about the headwinds for the remainder of the season we don t think there s going to be much of a benefit to us if it does bounce back simply because of timing but when you look at now into 20 as inventories are expected to normalize maybe you get to be a little bit low we would then expect a comeback into 20 which is really contemplated in this preliminary guidance that we ve given you folks tom hayes northcoast research analyst ok great and then maybe secondly on your thoughts on the craftsman s mower rollouts at lowe s into your participation and kind of the outlook for 2020 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah it s well the rollout s been very encouraging it s not just on mowers but on pressure washers too and you re seeing that come through the results the changes that have been made at lowe s with inventory stocking level remember last year they took inventories way down for a whole host of reasons including the brand transition so what s playing out on the craftsman situation is exactly what we thought was going to happen and in fact maybe to even a little bit stronger than what we had anticipated so as we look into 20 i mean you re going to have the channel flow that you saw this year because of the fact that they were stocking up on this but when you look at the amount of advertising that s going on by lowe s and by others it s very encouraging in the u s this season so that s as we look into fiscal 2020 we would expect that craftsman situation will continue to play very strongly tom hayes northcoast research analyst great and maybe two quick ones for you mark one you kind of faded out a little bit there on your comment on the inventory reduction the timing and the amount and then could you provide any color on the amount of business optimization expenses we should think about for the fourth quarter mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah the inventory reduction from the third quarter to the year end we re estimating to be about 100 million that said overall working capital change decline should be pretty similar sequentially year over year from q3 into q4 all in and then secondly on business optimization our outlook was just somewhere around 2 million to 6 million of optimization costs in q4 tom hayes northcoast research analyst great thanks for your time mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group thanks tom operator your next question comes from the line of sam darkatsh your line is now open unknown speaker good morning todd and mark this is josh filling in for sam thanks for taking my questions todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning josh mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group good morning josh unknown speaker long term question first in the past you had given a margin goal of 8 given some of the external headwinds you ve been facing can you give us an update on what year you might be able to reach that level and what sorts of things might need to happen in order to get there todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we re josh we re still the target s still 8 and we never put a date on it we just said that was our long term goal and we ultimately don t believe that a lot of the external things that are happening today ultimately have an impact on the long term goal that we have of 8 so what needs to happen is we just need to finish up on the business optimization program continue to put out really great products on the commercial side continue to put out really great products on the residential side and we will see the growth happen and we will see the margins improve get back to operational efficiency and we ll be back on track driving to that 8 so really nothing has changed and nothing this year all the stuff we view as being generally transitory and with a few things as we pointed out in the next year s preliminary guidance starts to work its way through and so the 8 is still a target and the time frame is still consistent with where we ve been unknown speaker thanks and then regarding the fourth quarter guidance can you give us a sense mark of what is baked into the high and low end in terms of how the season unfolds mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah we roughly assume pretty normal weather and as we commented looking pretty good now in the fourth quarter so far for the u s and europe the thing that is a little bit more of a wildcard this year is just a bit of dynamics in the landscape from a standpoint of sears not playing the same presence it used to and so it s one less retailer in place compared to the past and there s also a little bit less we anticipate less oem walk more production in the fourth quarter as well compared to where they would be the past due to some transitions going on there so those are the things that could potentially call it suppress a little bit of the fourth quarter even given good lawn and garden conditions and then on the high end it really comes down to a lot of the commercial growth and we ve seen some very nice growth to date there and anticipate some nice volumes in the fourth quarter as well we also anticipate some catch up on our service parts business which is helpful to the bottom line as well and we continue as todd mentioned the pressure washers have been going very well with the craftsman launch too and we see some continued strength there unknown speaker thank you and then you said your priority for cash uses debt reduction could you talk about how you might think about addressing the refinancing the upcoming maturity mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah with our bonds our senior notes of 195 million come due about a year from this december and so we ve begun the process to think through what options we could have in order to give ourselves financial capacity and financial flexibility roughly by the end of this calendar year so that we d be in a position to then retire the senior notes at a time of our choosing prior to their due date so that s something that we started working on and we ll keep you updated as we go forward unknown speaker and then the last one from me i saw you continued with the 0 14 dividend any commentary you want to give on your current thoughts on the dividend todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer the dividend s 0 14 and we expect the dividend to remain at 0 14 and over time we ll go higher unknown speaker thanks good luck with the next quarter todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs your line is now open tim wojs baird analyst hey everybody good morning todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer good morning mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group hi tim tim wojs baird analyst i have a few questions i guess maybe just starting with north america what do you what does the plan include for the residential engine business to grow in fiscal 19 and preliminarily in fiscal 20 and if you want to take out craftsman for fiscal 19 that s fine mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group well the primary goal for our residential engine business is really to hold the good share we have in improved margins and that s something that we re going to certainly continue to work on as we go forward the other thing that is significant there is new product development and we have targeted innovation that we ve launched over the years and we anticipate having continued pieces of innovation that help us improve our share in the market around the globe because when we have very high share in the traditional channels and north america and europe and australia there s other growing areas as well in those market so that channels like online and other things like that where we believe we can pick up market share as those things grow so those would be some of the primary areas on residential growth as well as the fact that the market remains pretty historically depressed and the housing market has been awfully choppy of late but the fundamental still seems to exist that there isn t enough supply for the demand at the entry level housing and the entry level housing is particularly where you re going to buy a walk behind mower which could inure well into our benefit as that balance were to shake out when that happens don t know but we would project more normalization there into the future tim wojs baird analyst ok ok and then i guess when you think about kind of fiscal 2020 guidance today i mean how i guess could we just maybe talk about the thought process behind giving that and i guess i m asking you from the perspective of we re just kind of getting into the current season and as you know there s just a lot of things and moving parts weather inventories and things that can develop over the course of the next 15 months so i guess when you look out to fiscal 2020 today i guess what are the key pieces of visibility that you have to maybe give that guidance this morning todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer so tim let me first address your comment or maybe question on why did we do this this is not normal that we would give next year s guidance in q3 at the end of q3 and we don t expect do it into the future but given just the significant transitory items that occurred in 19 we felt it was important to give all of you folks and investors and potential investors a glimpse into how we think about next year and how we think about some of the items this year and the takeaway you should have for why we did it was we wanted to communicate that these items are transitory they re temporary they re not structural and ultimately there s just a lot of moving pieces in fiscal 19 fiscal 19 is really a transition year in a number of different ways that then happened to have a lot of market headwinds due to weather related items and so that s why we thought it was important to give you an idea of where we currently think fiscal 2020 may shake out you re absolutely right there are a number of different things that will happen with inventories and the season progressing and where europe is and that sort of thing and what we ll do is we ll update this guidance as we get into august the thought process behind it is that ultimately we expect to see really strong commercial growth again in 20 we re seeing it here in 19 we ve seen it for the last five years we ve had double digit cagr over the last five or six years in this category and you should understand that we expect to continue to see that we also expect to see a rebound in residential as it relates to things like the european market again australia is has been so severe that we think that there s going to be some inventory higher levels of inventory coming out of this season because remember their season is now finishing up and so we have some visibility there so ultimately the other thing you need to understand is that we expect the inefficiencies will go away and we expect that we will get business optimization benefits and so that was the purpose behind giving you fiscal 2020 preliminary guidance early i think it s important for you to understand that we believe these things are transitory and they re just simply not going to repeat in 20 and we are on track as it relates to the execution of our strategy and we are just encountering some things of this year that are unfortunate are disappointing but at the end of the day we re managing our way through them tim wojs baird analyst ok ok understood and then i guess as we look at free cash flow for fiscal 19 is there a way to kind of think about what free cash flow should be into maybe this year and as you kind of look into fiscal 2020 what the rough conversion might look like mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah this year we came into the capex we expect to be around 65 million for the year which was online with what we planned we do think that free cash flow is going to as we ve talked about last quarter going to be negative slightly negative this year just given some of the headwinds of the operating results combined with the ongoing spending that we ve done this last year to complete the bring the business optimization program to completion as we go forward it s our long term financial goal to be able to convert about 3 to 4 of net sales into free cash flow and we think that we can make a lot of progress in getting there in fiscal 2020 based upon our preliminary estimates for 2020 where we would certainly be positive and quite positive in order to turn around that free cash flow as a percent of sales and that s going to come with the anticipated improved earnings combined with our ability to manage working capital and that s one of the benefits of the erp upgrade that we did is we do think that that s going to help in managing particularly inventory as we start going into 20 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer and tim let me just add tim let me add onto that when you look at preliminary 2020 guidance it s lower than what consensus has now this is the first time we ve come out with our number and a lot of you ve got a number that s out there the thing you got to keep in mind is we expect in 20 we re going we re not going to produce as much as we originally would expect meaning we re going to be producing especially on the engine business lower levels than what would be considered to be normal and that has a drag obviously on eps however what s really important now is to get the working capital back in line with where it needs to be and continue to get that cash flow generation back to where we ve historically had it if not better and so as mark pointed out we ve got targets on what we expect for free cash flow and things like that we re still going to see a little bit of an impact of kind of rolling out business optimization which i now think about it in terms of how do we flow the cash so that s having a drag on earnings for preliminary 2020 but the whole point is we use as mark pointed out we use the system we work through the system to ultimately have better asset velocity in the business and so again 18 19 has been kind of more transition years and as we now get into 20 we start to really realize some of the benefits we have the savings that we have baked we told you about we re experiencing now but then it also comes back to how do we better manage working capital in the balance sheet and flow cash and so that why we re really really optimistic about this new system it provides us with some new and different tools we just got a we ve got it up it s actually working quite well with the exception of what i would consider to be the service parts things we talked about in a little bit of australia but when you look at the rest of the business the business is now being able to understand this new system we re adapting our processes to the system and we expect that we re going to reap some real benefit out of this as we roll into 20 and 21 tim wojs baird analyst ok ok and then the last piece i have is maybe just a little more bigger picture so if you look at the engines business maybe over just the last 10 years the segments revenue s down maybe 400 million gross profit is kind of also down but the margin is actually up since then and really just sg a has been kind of flat or so over that period of time and i guess my question is just given the lower revenue levels what s the reasoning behind sg a i guess still being at that same level it was 10 years ago because it i guess it implies that sg a per unit is up fairly materially over the last 10 years and i guess business optimization probably will help with some of that but if you could just talk a little bit about how we should think of sg a over time just because that really hasn t moved over the last 10 years thanks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so tim what we ve done is we ve reallocated a lot of resources within esg a that you don t necessarily see how we ve reallocated them because we don t report segments that way let me give you let me tell you what i mean so if you think about our enabling technologies the two big or three big ones two of which are really big in the engine business in the power business one is electronic fuel injection and the other is electrification and so when you think about what we do and who we are we re a power application company so we don t think of ourselves any longer as being an engine company we think of ourselves as a power company a power application company and so what we ve done is we ve reallocated resources from what would be 10 years ago the traditional internal combustion engine engineering if you will in some of the support functions and now we ve reallocated that to things like electronic fuel injection some iot and then on electrification and you re going to start see coming out this fall we expect some of these offerings now on the electrification side so you ll see us coming out with our own products that ll have be battery powered and suffice to say in our long range plan we just took our board through some of our product planning over the last two days there is a tremendous amount of momentum with regards to battery type applications now some of that it s going to be some time before some of that adapts because internal combustion engines are still the most economical way to get power however when you look at the opportunities we have in electrification to expand the scope of our business beyond what historically has been lawn and garden there s other markets that we can play in now there s other markets we re playing in with vanguard engines as well my point to you is that esg a may have been relatively level but the way we spend the esg a is dramatically different and we ve been allocating to areas where we can get tremendous return while still being that provider of power so whether it s an internal combustion engine going forward and internal combustion engines will be around for a long time and we ll also have the opportunity to have batteries so when you look at kind of where we re at that s why you re not seeing sg a come down because of the investments that we re making in the enabling technologies tim wojs baird analyst ok ok thanks for the time and good luck over the summer here todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks tim operator your next question comes from the line of joe mondillo your line is now open joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst just regarding the 18 growth at the commercial business i was wondering if you could sort of not necessarily quantify what the sort of different buckets are generating but sort of obviously some bucket must be generating above 18 and probably below 18 so i m just wondering if you could sort of just hash through turf products turf engine industrial products not turf industrial engines are really making much of a movement at this point but if you could sort of just talk about that that d be great thanks todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah joe if you think about over the last few years we ve seen double digit cagr growth and early on we were seeing jobsite growth pretty tremendous and the reason we start seeing jobsite growth being pretty strong was when we bought allmand back in 15 it was really focused on oil and gas and as the oil and gas market really didn t do very well then shortly after 15 we pivoted into other things meaning light towers and for construction and jobsites and things like that and we also got into air towable air towable power so early on when we started to see the momentum that was stronger but we saw momentum across the board over the last 12 months or so jobsite is still strong but not perhaps as strong as it was two years ago and where we ve seen just tremendous growth has been on the commercial mowers and we ve seen tremendous growth in commercial engines and so i would tell you it s pretty much across the board with more recently being skewed toward the engines business as well as the commercial mowers where jobsite continues to grow but perhaps not at the same pace as it had a few years ago joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst all right and is that just on the engine side i guess it sounds like that s definitely a strength of the near term at least is that engine placement and just new customer wins could you just talk about the engine growth that you ve seen todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer well i would tell you the growth is both on engines and commercial turf we ve seen our ferris mowers have been tremendous over the last few years and that has to do with better placement out in the markets we re signing up new dealers new distributors i would also tell you that we ve got new models out over the last year and a half or two years it s been up almost 50 in terms of new models on the engine side it s a combination of things one is we now have a better value proposition if you will we always had a strong value prop coming out of japan but now being closer to the market we re finding that people really are excited about the fact that we ve shortened up lead times and they can do they can we re easier to business with that way we ve also launched some new products over the last for years and if you look at our vanguard 200 single cylinder you look at our vanguard 400 that we ve launched we ve got two other models that will be coming out we continue to see we see continued growth in this area simply because we ve got a better value proposition as we move onshore the engines and we ve got a better product offering than what we ve had in the past because we ve launched these new products over the last few years so it s not just one area it s broad based commercial growth mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group weigh in on the commercial turf area you had in some of the bolt on acquisitions that todd commented on earlier like the hurricane blowers and ground logic spreader sprayer it s gone really well and helped us round up the trailer nicely for the professional mower joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst and just a follow up a last question regarding this as you ve rolled out all these new models and new products within commercial and then probably more importantly the tariffs and higher costs and everything related to that are the margins at commercial that s this 18 growth at commercial are the margins still i mean you ve said in the past 500 to 600 basis points higher than residential is it still that strong and if so i m assuming that the product mix shift to commercial i guess it s just being offset tremendously by all these inefficiencies that you ve talked about on your prepared remarks and the call itself todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah joe so when you look at the margins it s still as up to 500 basis points different that doesn t mean it s on every product but i would tell you that when you look at the product mix shift yes it s benefited the thing that i think people get confused by at times though is when you look at the residential business when we don t have throughput in the plants obviously it has a drag on margins so yeah we had some of the inefficiencies that we talked about that but i think the other thing that s really important to understand is that the residential side of the business when you look at a year like we re having with market headwinds in europe and australia you ultimately don t have the throughput coming into the business the other thing is margins in europe and australia are generally better than what we get here in the u s given the different market structures over there so i wouldn t hang it all on the inefficiencies that s not it it s partially it but it s not the full picture so i think it s important to kind of consider the market headwinds on the residential side that we don t expect will continue into next year that s why we re projecting the kind of bounce back that we re projecting joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok and then i guess to follow on your sort of throughput comment i totally understand that with the erp system and sort of how you re managing working capital and how you re managing the plants and production overall could you talk about and i m guessing some of this or a lot of it is actually baked in the benefits of business up but talk about sort of the benefits that you re how the business overall changes because obviously with all these weather events the last two years inventory got way out of whack and now you re sort of trying to recover and try to sort of improve things going forward but it sounds like going forward the whole system and the process and working capital and everything is going to change hopefully a huge amount for the better could you just sort of talk more about that mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group joe i think you hit on it because the other thing that certainly been the case in 2019 as we have a lot of things all going at once at the same time initiative wise and so that onto themselves they re all excellent things but then from an execution standpoint that s where a little bit of the inefficiencies popped out and that we just have a lot of people working pretty hard to execute these things and the point with some the 2020 preliminary outlook is to show you just how confident we are that that bounces back and we got our arms around it so indeed from both a working capital standpoint particularly around inventory inventory management we ve had to ramp a little bit when you think about going live with the erp we ve now gotten better even in a short period of time with managing inventory we have new tools within our warehouses to be much more precise with what s where and we will be able to drive that to manage lower levels from the working capital standpoint and then the benefit standpoint from the todd commented that we expect to get an incremental 15 million of benefits and business optimization in 2020 on top of the i ll call it 2 million to 3 million that i commented on that we re recognizing in 19 a little bit behind pacing wise where we thought we d be but still on track to get to the up to 40 million benefits by 2021 so that s pretty significant and then on top of that you get the commercial sales mix that you guys are talking about as well and you combine that with more normal utilization of the facilities and more normalized service part throughput which comes at a nice margin relative to the portfolio and you re absolutely right it s a very different business from a top line bottom line perspective joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst ok last question i know the call is extended pretty long i just wanted to make sure that i understand any anticipated headwinds for fiscal 20 and one being australia that i can think of if there s anything else your comments regarding australia seem to i thought maybe it contradicted a little bit it sounded like initially in the prepared remarks you sort of cited the elevated inventory is going to probably be a headwind as we go into fiscal 20 but then i thought todd you may have said to sort of the opposite so i m wondering about that headwind and are there any sort of other headwinds that you re sort of thinking about i know there s several tailwinds that you ve obviously covered on the call but anything else that you think could be at risk going into fiscal 20 todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer yeah let me just clarify on the australia situation we don t expect that there s going to be a big rebound we would expect and maybe i misspoke earlier we expect that there will be inventory hangover if you will elevated inventories coming out of the season in australia and so therefore that will have an impact where we won t see the kind of bounce back next year that we would expect to see in europe because europe we expect to see a bounce back next year but australia we don t let me just note a couple of other things to your question then mark can fill it out i would tell you the other things that you just need to remember are the fact that production levels again are going to be are not going to be back to what we consider to be normalized levels that will be a headwind because ultimately we want to make sure we re taking down working capital and we re cash flowing the business other things mark mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah the two other things really that we commented on were the pension expense and we do expect about 0 07 per share of pension headwinds going into 20 and that s nothing other than our anticipation of a lower asset return compared to where we ve been as we work down our glide path to derisk our pension volatility as one item and then the other thing is related to our early comments we made on the whole sears market transition you recall when we took out the 30 million of revenue in 2019 we said we didn t anticipate all of it to come back right away and so indeed as we start to estimate out to 2020 it seems to be playing out roughly along the lines of what we had anticipated it would but we still have some more time to go in the season and we ll be able to better judge that in august but we want to anticipate all the loss sears volume coming back in 2020 some of it would hangover and come back later likely 21 joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst right and that would be a net tailwind still but just not maybe the full tailwind that you saw in terms of headwind in fiscal 19 right mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah especially if you re comparing against how we started out at the beginning of this year with our estimates and the ramp rate then into 20 and 21 compared to 19 that s a change in circumstance of course joe mondillo sidoti and company analyst great ok all right thanks a lot thanks for taking my questions todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thanks joe operator your next question comes from the line of matthew your line is now open unknown speaker hey guys i m just trying to square some comments about your cash generation and i m having difficulty with so if you take kind of the midpoint of your 2020 guidance for sales and then you take the midpoint of that 3 to 4 of sales for as your cash flow goal that s like 70 million of cash flow potentially but you said you sort of want to work up to that which implies that 2020 actual cash flow generation is going to be less but on the other hand you re saying that maybe production is going to be low while you sort of work through some inventory so maybe there s some working capital at least or cash flow is actually higher like how do we square what potential for cash flow generation in 2020 is going to be mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group yeah there s obviously some variables that ll have to play out but based on our estimates now we think we can get very close to our goal of that 3 to 4 conversion likely on the lower end of the range in 2021 and then it really comes down to some of the working capital management and timing that we can drive we think we have a good beat on things related to that we believe we have good control over capital spending and although our goal is 65 million a year of capital spending going forward we might even endeavor to try to do less than that if the opportunity arises so those are a couple of the big things that we are really working on hard to manage with that priority toward improving some delevering unknown speaker so along that front is the goal to use some of this cash flow generation over the next 15 quarters i m sorry 15 months to chip away that maturity before you go to refinance it with these continued open market purchases of the bonds mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group no i wouldn t necessarily say that specific our goal is more around our total net debt position and right now over the last 12 months or so our revolving credit agreement borrowings have been a little bit higher than they ve been in the past due to the operating performance and then just higher spending on initiatives and we ve also reduced a little bit of the senior notes over the last 12 months as well so we think about it more on the overall basis of the full debt and we d like to see the full debt relative to the earnings delever a bit with the use of the cash flow and then as i commented from a refinancing standpoint the whole thinking is that we just like to have good capacity and flexibility in place our goal would be by the end of the calendar year so that we could then retire the senior notes at a time of our choosing unknown speaker yeah so about that timing obviously if you let it go into calendar 2020 it becomes a current liability on your balance sheet which auditors may or may not approve of are you comfortable letting this maturity go into 2020 or do you intend to try to address it before calendar 2020 mark schwertfeger vice president and president job site and standby group really need to address that as we go through our whole financing options as we work through that in the upcoming couple of quarters and the like in getting toward that december 2020 we have i believe we have good options available to us and so we ll see where all of that goes but really i think the important part i d say i want to have good capacity and flexibility to the extent i can demonstrate i got capacity i think that eases the audit concerns and the like that you mentioned because it gives me the flexibility to take out the notes at a time of my choosing unknown speaker ok all right thanks very much todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this time please continue todd teske chairman president and chief executive officer all right well thank you very much for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again in august thanks operator duration 74 minutes call participants mark

this past week has seen massive queues in syria s capital damascus outside petrol gas stations the fuel shortage has become far worse than during the war bringing commercial life almost to a standstill with domestic oil production down as a result of war damage and disruption to only 24 000 barrels per day bpd far less than the 136 000 bpd it needs the government has rationed petrol private cars are allowed 20 litres every five days and taxis 20 litres every 48 hours before the war syria enjoyed relative energy autonomy this follows the ending of a credit line and oil supplies from iran in october and us sanctions against iran and syria that have intensified since us president donald trump s declared the final defeat of the islamic state of iraq and syria isis damascus sought to replace iranian supplies via private sector importers but this met with little success as ships have been prevented from reaching syria after entering regional waters in november the us treasury issued a warning threatening anyone involved in shipping petroleum to the syrian government with sanctions the aim is to cut off the syrian government and its supporters from the global financial and trade systems the pentagon has also made it clear that despite trump s plan to withdraw us troops from syria the illegal us military presence in syria will continue indefinitely with a residual force the us wants to preclude any reunification and reconstruction of the war ravaged country by carving out its own sphere of influence in syria s northeast this would seize control over the country s main oil and gas producing region using syria as a base for preparing a wider and bloodier war against iran while encouraging israel to play a major role in military operations against syria washington is seeking to create the conditions for a rebellion against the assad regime as in iran and venezuela by crashing its economy and exacerbating the country s social and economic crisis and thereby impose a pro us regime in damascus the assad government is compelled to manoeuvre between the threats from an increasingly rapacious us imperialism the demands of its backers in moscow and tehran and the mounting anger of an impoverished working class against the war profiteers traffickers and regime insiders benefiting from what little reconstruction is taking place washington s eight year long proxy war against syria along with its more than four years of intense aerial bombing has devastated the country causing immense human suffering nearly half a million people have died there are 3 million people living with permanent disabilities around 11 million people nearly half the population have fled their homes some 5 6 million are living in neighbouring countries including 3 6 million living in turkey while there are 6 2 million internally displaced creating the world s largest refugee crisis since world war ii the war involving hundreds of militias fighting the syrian regime and each other has laid waste to industrial cities and infrastructure water sanitation and electrical systems barely function in the former rebel held areas schools and hospitals have been flattened some 2 million children are not in school us bombing has reduced cities and towns such as raqqa to rubble while in rural areas irrigation channels no longer function and grain silos have been destroyed leading to a 40 percent reduction in food production particularly wheat more than 80 percent of syrians are living in extreme poverty on less than 1 90 per day in what was a middle income country according to a world bank survey 56 percent of the country s businesses have either closed or relocated outside the country since 2009 while unemployment rose from less than 10 percent in 2010 to over 50 percent in 2015 it estimates that the cumulative loss in gdp between 2011 and 2016 was 226 billion around four times syria s 2010 gdp a third of those losses were in the oil and gas sector soaring inflation a depreciating currency that has plummeted from a pre war exchange rate of 50 syrian pounds to 550 pounds to the dollar stagnant wages and plummeting purchasing power means that even the basics are unaffordable the ever deepening poverty is causing endless privation compounded by frequent and lengthy water and electricity shutoffs and fuel shortages many are dependent on remittances from syrians abroad estimated by the world bank to be about 1 62 billion in 2016 higher than the total from salaries and wages as well as unofficial transfers through unlicensed offices individuals and traffickers the wealthy are insulated from all of this with cafes and restaurants in the upscale neighbourhoods busy in stark contrast to the long queues to buy subsidised bread and replace empty gas canisters for cooking the hardships of the war have been compounded by the sanctions imposed since 2011 by the united states the european union eu and the un on imports such as some fuels as well as syrian individuals accused of financially supporting the regime last january after trump said he was bringing us troops in syria back home the eu issued sanctions against a further 11 businessmen and five associated companies while the us congress passed legislation the orwellian caesar syria civilian protection act broadening existing sanctions to include non us citizens who deal with the assad regime so called secondary sanctions while saudi arabia and the united arab emirates appear to be considering giving some financial support to damascus to counter long term iranian hegemony in syria these sanctions could hit anyone including gulf based companies involved in syria s reconstruction variously estimated at between 250 billion about four times syria s pre war gdp and 400 billion the banks block transfers from syria making it impossible to source european parts without using prohibitively expensive informal financial networks while russia and iran s military support was a crucial factor in the assad regime s survival they do not have the resources to make a major contribution to syria s reconstruction iran is in the grips of economic crisis due to us sanctions and is suffering from unprecedented floods especially in its oil producing region syria has indicated both countries will have first priority in the allotment of any reconstruction funds that it receives particularly in the energy and construction sectors in january 2018 damascus gave moscow exclusive rights to extract oil and gas from areas under assad s direct control and later the restoration of oil fields and the development of new deposits moscow also won a 50 year deal to run syria s phosphate industry the us and major european powers have refused any significant aid while assad remains in power in a bid to force his main international and domestic supporters to withdraw their backing last march international donors at an eu hosted conference in brussels pledged almost 7 billion including 397 million from the us for civilians affected by the conflict far less than the eu said was needed last year only 65 percent of the 3 4 billion required for the inside syria plan last year was received while its regional refugee and resilience plan costing 5 6 billion was only 62 percent funded the focus was not on reconstruction but on measures to encourage refugees to return home amid reports that the syrian government s treatment of returning refugees includes killings disappearances intimidation and sometimes compulsory military service new legislation makes it difficult for returnees to prove ownership of the homes they fled the eu fears an influx of refugees to europe unless aid for both syria and the countries hosting the refugees is forthcoming the us drive to crash syria s economy is bound up with its campaign to reimpose neo colonial bondage over the entire region and to continue the series of ruinous wars washington has sparked in the middle east since 1991 in a bid to exercise unfettered dominance of the world s most important oil and gas exporting region

officer thank you lou anne good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call my remarks will cover the first quarter performance of our two business segments hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection as most of you know both businesses are seasonal the majority of the revenue and operating profit is typically earned in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday selling season the first quarter is the smallest of the year and the first half is the smallest half but first quarter results were only slightly behind our expectations and we expect the first half to be in line with our previous outlook at hamilton beach brands revenue for the first quarter was 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million last year revenue growth in the u s consumer market was partially offset by decreases in some of the international consumer markets global commercial revenue was comparable to last year unfavorable foreign currency movements reduced revenue by 700 000 as the canadian dollar and mexican peso weakened against the u s dollar progress with our strategic initiatives continued to drive growth in new areas in the u s e commerce channel initiatives we put into place to address the challenges we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018 were beneficial and e commerce sales increased significantly in the first quarter compared to last year sales increased for our only the best products which are sold under the weston and hamilton beach professional brands and the license to wolf gourmet and chi brands driven in part by a number of new products launched for each brand in 2018 gross profit margin decreased to 20 7 from 22 1 last year primarily due to higher spot ocean freight rates on routes from china to the u s as importers accelerated container deliveries ahead of impending tariff increases while we were prepared for the impact of tariffs and expected some level of container cost increases the size of the increase during our peak shipping period was difficult to offset we expect our full year 2019 gross margin percent will be comparable to 2018 and we expect sequential improvement in each of the remaining quarters this year operating profit was 1 6 million compared to eight 3 8 million last year primarily due to the higher freight costs and to increased sg a expenses for the legal and professional fees including patent litigation expense next i d like to provide additional details regarding the important progress we continue to make with our key long term growth drivers new product platforms introduced in 2018 90 in all will benefit us in 2019 and beyond this year we are introducing a similarly strong line up of new products including a full line of air fryers and pressure cookers and we expect to gain share in these new fast growing categories in the first quarter the hamilton beach brand continued to hold the no 1 unit share position in the u s small kitchen appliance industry in both brick and mortar and e commerce channels each of the only the best brands generated double digit growth last year and all of them benefited from new product introductions and expanded retail distribution which we expect will benefit us this year and beyond we re introducing additional new products this year including a wolf gourmet stand mixer a weston electric food mill and sous vide circulator two hamilton beach professional hand mixers and new chi irons we expect growth from each of the brands continued distribution channel expansion and growth and share growth in stores and online global e commerce continues to grow for small kitchen appliances success in this channel requires providing products at the right price strong ratings and reviews and meaningful engagement with online shoppers our objective is to grow faster than the e commerce rate in each market where we compete we continue to focus on providing best in class retailer support increasing engagement with end users and enhancing programs designed to make us the preferred partner globally our products generally earn online ratings of four stars and above and favorable reviews in 2019 we expect e commerce sales growth in all markets in our global commercial business we have experienced strong growth across the americas europe and asia in the past few years we expect that broader distribution of several newer products will generate incremental revenue in the coming years increasingly the e commerce channel is becoming more significant in the commercial marketplace for both food service and hospitality purchase decision makers in those markets are using the internet more each day to both research products and purchase products we ve invested in a leading way to provide a digital marketing platform while maintaining our presence in traditional channels in international markets we plan to continue to expand in canada and mexico as well as latin america brazil and china where we have full teams in place we re finalizing plans to enter the india market with a soft launch in the second quarter we continue to evaluate additional markets through direct participation or brand licensing revenue in all the international markets in which we participate is expected to grow in 2019 we believe that our leadership in satisfying unmet consumer needs will enable us to continue to excel at providing products that are specifically designed to meet unique consumer needs in particular global markets examples of such items include a removable reservoir iron for the consumers in brazil the hamilton beach professional high performance blender for consumers in china and the hamilton beach professional juicer mixer grinder for consumers in india we launched new products in new categories outside of the traditional kitchen appliances in 2017 and 2018 including compact refrigerators coffee airpots knife sharpeners laundry accessories kitchen and bathroom scales among others revenue from new categories is expected to grow in 2019 as we introduce more products and gain traction the e commerce channel in particular enables us to introduce new products quickly and relatively inexpensively and react on a timely basis to consumer responses to new offerings we re excited about the progress we are making toward our long term growth objectives of reaching 750 million to 1 billion in annual revenue and 9 to 10 operating profit margin over time our initiatives provide many paths to reaching our revenue goals while some of our initiatives are delivering faster growth than others all of them have shown momentum and we will build upon them in the coming years next i will discuss the kitchen collection segment in 2018 and in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection continued to make solid progress with initiatives to return to profitability by closing underperforming stores moving all stores to a one year lease term maintaining gross margins reducing expenses and managing working capital at the end of 2018 kitchen collection had 189 stores in the first quarter of this year kitchen collection closed 21 stores and currently plans to close an additional 10 stores by the end of the year with the majority of the closures occurring in the second quarter by the end of 2019 kitchen collection expects to have 158 stores at that time 85 of the stores will have a lease term of approximately one year greatly increasing operating flexibility to respond to low store profitability levels kitchen collection believes it can rightsize its store portfolio aggressively over the next year or two with a core group of 100 to 150 adequately profitable stores in favorable outlet mall locations store lease decisions will be based on store by store profitability in the first quarter kitchen collection generated revenue of 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million last year the decrease was due to the closure of underperforming stores and lower comparable store sales both of which reflected a continued downward trend in customer traffic while the gross margin rate was down from last year given the number of stores we closed in the quarter we believe kitchen collection delivered a very good performance in gross margin percent we expect the full year gross margin to be in line with 2018 kitchen collection reduced its operating loss compared to last year the operating loss was 3 7 million an improvement of 600 000 compared to the operating loss of 4 3 million last year as a result of store closures and corporate expense reductions kitchen collection reduced operating expenses by 2 2 million compared to the first quarter of 2018 as most of you know kitchen collection typically has a loss in the early quarters of the year due to the seasonality of the business so in the first half our goal is to reduce the loss versus the prior year as we execute our strategy and the team accomplished that even with a large number of stores closing we offset the cost of closing which includes things like severance clearance promotions travel costs to and from the stores etc we re encouraging we re encouraged that kitchen collection is on track with the strategy we have been communicating and that its performance is improving as always if foot traffic to the malls is in line with our expectations as it was in the first quarter then we should be able to lever our improved performance if foot traffic improves or declines meaningfully kitchen collection s performance will likely follow with that overview of our two segments i ll turn the call over to michelle who will discuss our consolidated results michelle mosier vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you greg and good morning everyone my comments will focus first on our consolidated results for the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year since greg has already reviewed our two segments in detail my comments will be mostly high level after discussing our consolidated first quarter results i will discuss our outlook for 2019 consolidated revenue was 145 4 million compared to 146 6 million last year at hamilton beach brands revenue increased to 126 7 million compared to 125 4 million at kitchen collection revenue decreased to 19 3 million compared to 22 1 million consolidated gross profit was 34 7 million compared to 37 8 million last year as a percentage of revenue gross profit was 23 9 compared to 25 8 as greg said we expect full year gross profit margin in both segments to be comparable to 2018 consolidated selling general and administrative expenses were 36 5 million compared to 38 million last year the decrease was primarily due to expense reductions in kitchen collection partially offset by increased legal and professional service fees at hbb the consolidated operating loss was 2 1 million compared to an operating loss of 500 000 last year operating profit at hamilton beach brands was offset by an operating loss at kitchen collection consolidated net interest expense was 746 000 compared to 532 000 last year the increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding under hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection s revolving credit facility and higher average interest rate we recognize an income tax benefit of 800 000 on a loss before income taxes of 2 5 million an effective tax rate of 30 8 the effective tax rate increased from 25 9 for the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to an insignificant one time tax benefit recorded in 2019 related to our non u s pension plan consolidated net loss was 1 8 million or 0 13 per diluted share compared to a consolidated net loss of 400 000 or 0 03 per diluted share for 2018 next i ll discuss cash flow consolidated use of cash before financing activities was 100 excuse me 51 million compared to 41 5 million last year at both segments efforts to lower inventory were successful however the benefit was more than offset by a change in accounts payable due to the timing of payments capital expenditures were 900 000 compared to 2 4 million last year the decrease was primarily due to lower capital spending related to hamilton beach brands software development costs total cash expenditures for the year are expected to be approximately 4 5 million at hamilton beach brands and 300 000 at kitchen collection the remaining planned capital expenditures are primarily for the development of our erp system and tooling for new products at hamilton beach brands the company had cash on hand of 1 7 million compared to 2 4 million last year debt was 94 2 million compared to 85 5 million the higher debt level was due to fund was used to fund working capital at hamilton beach brands we re focused on getting our inventory cash flow and debt back to our desired level with inventory being the key element given the large volume in the fourth quarter traditionally the post holiday period brings large swings in working capital between the first and second quarters inventory in the first quarter was down meaningfully compared to the 2018 first quarter and we expect that trend to continue we continue to work to improve our dso and dpo and now let me turn to our outlook hamilton beach brands expects its 2019 revenue to grow moderately as a result of the continued successful implementation of its strategic initiatives including new customer new consumer and commercial product introduction only the best placements and continued expansion in the e commerce channel and international markets revenue for each of the strategic initiatives is expected to be above 2018 full year operating profit is currently expected to increase moderately over 2018 including a decrease in the first half of the year and an increase in the second half of the year compared to 2018 the second half outlook may change as customer commitments for the fall holiday selling season are confirmed in the second and third quarters while it s too early to confirm the final picture we have encountered new unfavorable issues that will pull our outlook down hamilton beach brands expects cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly in 2019 compared to 2018 kitchen collection expects its full future performance to be closely aligned with customer traffic trends including any potential improvements or further declines for 2019 kitchen collection s revenue is expected to decrease compared to 2018 as a result of store closures and low comparable store sales as a result of progress with its initiatives to return to profitability including significant expense reduction kitchen collection expects its operating loss and use of cash before financing activities in 2019 to improve if customer traffic to stores is line with expectations as it was in the first quarter kitchen collection expects to be able to deliver its anticipated improved performance based on the outlooks for the hamilton beach brands and kitchen collection segments hamilton beach brands holding company expects 2019 net income to increase and cash flow before financing activities to increase significantly over 2018 that concludes our prepared remarks we ll now turn the line back to the operator for q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of peter benedict from baird your line is open peter benedict baird analyst hey guys good morning i guess a couple of questions first just on the new categories you talked about the air fryers and pressure cookers coming just curious the timing when we should expect to see these in the market and is there any way to frame maybe the size of these categories relative to the broader market that s my first question scott tidey senior vice president north america sales and marketing hey peter this is scott we have talked about air fryers we currently have two air fryers in the market today one under proctor silex and one under hamilton beach and we ve got three more that are coming in the third quarter so we ve got two different sizes out there right now i think a one and a half and a two and a half liter with some larger capacities coming in the back half of the year and we continue to see that category grow also to go after that category we see that we think that business will transfer a little bit into the air fry and oven category and so we also work on new product development for that space as well for the pressure cookers we ve got two pressure cookers coming out one in the second quarter late in the second quarter and one in the third quarter so again a couple of platforms there that we ll be able to go after that size of business that category has slowed down a little bit but we do feel like that there s a good opportunity for us to come out with the two products that we have we think we re priced competitively and we ll be able to get some decent distribution in the marketplace peter benedict baird analyst ok good that s helpful the next one is just around in a private label which i know i think in the past you guys has been a big focus or even in this category necessarily but just curious i mean a lot of retailers working aggressively around private brands across their store curious kind of where you guys where your thought process is around private label maybe remind us what you ve done in the past and just how you re thinking about it going forward is it anything that s part of the plans that we should be thinking about greg trepp president and chief executive officer so we this is greg so private label has been a part of small appliances for a long time and sort of it s a little different than some other categories and mainly because once you put a plug on something there are safety issues there are performance issues you need a product that cooks properly or works properly and then certainly making sure you re understanding consumer needs and coming up with products that meet those needs so what we sort of found is that the in the small appliance business our private label will fluctuate between the low single digits i m sorry low double digits to maybe 15 to 20 of the market but it has not pushed up past that in the past so we assume that will continue to be the case we definitely have participated with retailers in the past and we currently do work with retailers in some areas on brands that are protected brands for them we have some meaningful business with some retailers so for us it s certainly a part of our portfolio it s one of the services we want to provide but generally speaking if it stays in that 10 to 15 range we won t find a role for ourselves in a lot of the businesses given the cost structure that the retailers need so my our belief is that it will sort be something that we participate in but not tried here at least in the near term peter benedict baird analyst ok that s helpful greg so you re not seeing just like a notable change in some of your customers desire to kind of to build out private brands further is that fair greg trepp president and chief executive officer that is fair yes we definitely many of our retail partners want a private label business as part of their portfolio for sure but that s sort of been the case for a long time so we don t see it changing in any way that s changing the whole industry scott tidey senior vice president north america sales and marketing and peter this is scott i do think we see some retailers are looking for more exclusive items so we will create an item that might be for one particular retailer and have a different feature set or different for different retailers so there could be exclusives but it would be under our brand and not under a private label brand name peter benedict baird analyst ok that s makes sense scott and then my last question just on the revenue outlook within hb i mean you re saying grow moderately now i think you were saying increase modestly my sense is that s an incrementally favorable comment but just wanted to clarify that and then just how do you think your 19 revenue plan compares to just the overall industry what is there anything going on from an industry standpoint that s noteworthy in terms of what you guys are seeing or expecting for growth in 2019 thank you greg trepp president and chief executive officer sure so for the full year i think where we are right now with worrying about customer decisions and watching other markets going i think we kind of feel pretty much in line with what we talked about in the past so any small changes in wording has not been intentional for the full year view of things but so we think we re from what we know now we think we re in a position to grow as we learn more about placements and promotional support we ll adjust that outlook moving forward in the overall market i think what we ve seen is we ve done particularly well in a number of categories that we ve been in traditionally when you if you put pressure cookers and air fryers aside we ve held up very well and adjust to things like e commerce and things but we certainly are very focused on also entering that fast growing part of the market to participate there and that ties into the products scott brought up so for pressure cookers and multi cookers as they finished the year last year still very strong very big big share of business that to scott s point they are still growing and the growth has slowed noticeably however it s been a quarter or two not i think could sort of pick back up who knows certainly very popular products it s not rolling over it s not tanking so i think if the these fast growing categories all sort of flatten out maybe grow a little bit maybe decline a little bit we don t expect them to go through the roof again or tank but they sort of stay modestly growing and modestly declining yeah they could well i think will be in a position to keep up with the market and hopefully beat the trend if pressure cookers were to roll over in a big way because we the silver lining for not participating in that growth would have been that it wouldn t hurt us as it came down so we would probably be ahead of the market but i say as we stand right now we re assuming that it s going to sort of soften to a lower growth rate and our goal is to grow a little faster than the overall market peter benedict baird analyst ok fair enough all right thanks guys appreciate it greg trepp president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mitchell lolley from nixon capital your line is open mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst hi i was just wondering first if you guys could give a little bit more color on the accounts payable timing shift issue in the quarter greg trepp president and chief executive officer sure as you go into mitchell this is greg as you go into the through the holiday season each year we have between we order in our inventory we have depending on the time of the inventory sometimes the retailer will have a big event in september october november depends on which ones we win sometimes they ll do direct import perhaps they will do through our warehouse system so that affects when we buy it therefore our payables are when we receive it and it s such a big part of the year that as that flows through the fourth quarter it impacts when all those elements the working capital are coming to fruition during first quarter second quarter and a lot of times this spills over into early second quarter so as we look forward we feel like we ve made good improvement on our inventory as michelle said and then as the payables work through the based on again the timing that we experienced in the fourth quarter it really will just sort of roll off naturally in the second quarter and be in line with what we thought so really we naturally have a late first quarter second quarter movement of some of these things receivables and payables and i think we re sort of at a little point here where it moved a little bit on us but it s just timing more than anything else mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst ok and then another question i had is i noticed that operating losses at kitchen collection were almost they re about 14 15 lower year over year is that a pace of year over year improvement in operating losses that you think could hold for the rest of the year greg trepp president and chief executive officer well we don t give specific guidance in that front but last year was a performance we were not happy with and we ve the things we ve talked about doing closing stores and holding our margin in line and all those getting out of stores that are causing a loss we have a lot of that hard work coming to fruition this year so our really with foot traffic being the big wild card we could see continued positive improvement versus the loss all year long if the foot traffic as we said earlier gets better or gets worse it s going to change it pretty fast but we ve assumed some level of foot traffic decline and our goal is to keep working margin expenses etc to make sure we improve in 2019 over 2018 mitchell lolley nixon capital analyst you just mentioned that changes in foot traffic can have a pretty dramatic and quick increase on the results and that leads me to kind of my broader question which is why is it a good strategy in general to continue dragging around a money losing asset that will never earn its cost of capital greg trepp president and chief executive officer well we ve talked in some of the past calls that we look at our business from a long term shareholder value improvement point of view and so as we look at all of our portfolio whether it s parts of the hamilton beach business or the kitchen collection business we re going to come up we re going to work a strategy that allows us to improve shareholder value over time so as we work to improve kitchen collection we could take steps today that would provide some short term news but wouldn t be the most shareholder friendly way to make the business move to a different place so what i will say is that we are being very focused and very deliberate and very strategic but also very cold about the steps we ve got to take to move both hb and kc to a better place and so our view is that we got to keep working at this year and getting it to a much better place so i think we don t view it as we re dragging things around but we definitely know that we need to get that business and our whole business to a better place to help increase shareholder value operator there are no more questions at this time i turn the call back over to the presenters greg trepp president and chief executive officer ok thank you and just a few last comments so we are excited about the prospects for advancing our strategic initiatives in our hamilton beach brands segment and for making further progress with our strategy to rightsize our kitchen collection store portfolio as we ve communicated our company takes a long term view and we are committed to building shareholder value over the long term we remain focused on the innovation initiatives and investments that are needed for the long term success of the business and before signing off i d like to note that in june we are participating in the baird consumer technology and services conference in new york our presentation is scheduled for wednesday june 5 at 3 10 p m and we hope to see some of you there so with that i will conclude our call today and thank you for

website and with that i d like to turn the call over to david david fisher chief executive officer good afternoon everyone thanks for joining our call today i m going to start by giving a brief overview of the first quarter and then i ll update you on our strategy after that i ll turn the call over to steve cunningham our cfo who will discuss our financial results and guidance in more detail we kicked off the year with a strong first quarter top line results were in line with our guidance driven by demand consistent with typical q1 seasonality in the quarter we also experienced good credit performance and very effective and efficient marketing this enabled us to deliver solid profitability that exceeded the top end of our guidance first quarter revenue of 293 million increased 15 over last year primarily driven by growth in our u s businesses and first quarter adjusted ebitda was a record 75 million an increase of 10 over last year while adjusted eps increased 14 to 1 16 these results reflect the strong credit quality i just mentioned as well as our continued consistent execution and solid operating leverage inherent in our online model during the quarter loans to new customers represented 26 of total originations in line with q1 of last year as we ve mentioned in the past these new customers ultimately expand our returning customer base and revenue potential going forward while our new customer mix was down slightly from the low 30s we saw in the back half of 2018 this is to be expected with typical first quarter seasonality driven by the tax return season in the u s as i mentioned we also saw excellent credit performance from our customers with noticeable improvements in credit quality across our portfolio and charge offs in line with our expectations while net charge offs were higher than last year this is largely a result of the high mix of new customers over the last several quarters as well as our ongoing portfolio mix shift to installment and line of credit products we are confident that our sophisticated analytics and over 15 years of experience as well as all of our data allows us to effectively maintain excellent credit quality across our products total companywide originations in the first quarter declined 3 year over year this was largely due to a tough comp as we did not experience the typical tax seasonality in 2018 which resulted in much higher than expected originations last year the 21 sequential decline in originations again reflects the seasonality we typically see in q1 combined with our ongoing diversification into loc and installment products this diversification can be seen in total a r which was up 16 year over year and down only 7 sequentially as steve will discuss in more detail the moderation of growth we saw in q1 resulted in adjusted ebitda and eps above our expectations while still delivering strong consistent revenue growth as expected in a year where we saw more typical seasonality in the first quarter originations have accelerated as we ve entered the second quarter we ve discussed on prior calls how managing growth can be challenging but our experienced team is able to leverage our sophisticated analytics models to respond rapidly to changes in demand by adjusting our marketing spend and credit cut offs our past results have demonstrated our ability to manage these growth versus profitability trade offs and we ll continue to focus on running the business with this balanced approach going forward we believe our strong performance is attributable to our focus on our 6 growth businesses namely our u s subprime business our u s near prime offering our u k consumer brands u s small business financing our installment loan business in brazil and enova decisions our analytics as a service business our large u s subprime consumer business generated another strong quarter of growth and profitability originations increased 6 year over year and the portfolio remains well diversified consisting of 52 line of credit products 34 installment products and only 14 single pay products we continue to believe there is a significant opportunity for future growth in the u s given the large addressable market and our single digit market share net credit loan balances increased 21 year over year to over 450 million and originations increased 8 year over year our u s near prime products represented 46 of our total portfolio at the end of q1 compared to 45 in q1 of last year netcredit has become a very large business yet we still see many avenues for future growth in the near prime market our first quarter u k revenue decreased 12 year over year on a constant currency basis primarily driven by the purposeful repositioning of our u k business to focus on installment offerings during the quarter we relaunched on stride financial our installment product in the u k on stride offers a variety of durations and a wider range of aprs and is resonating well with consumers there installment loan revenue in the u k increased 18 year over year and 26 on a constant currency basis overall we remain the leading subprime lender by market share in the u k and believe we are well positioned for future growth turning to small business as we discussed in our q4 earnings call in recent quarters we have seen a strengthening of demand for our small business products at attractive unit economics leading us to be moderately more assertive in expanding in this space the result was good growth in our small business financing products during q1 originations increased 58 year over year resulting in small business representing 10 of our total loan book at the end of q1 going forward we will be focused on maintaining growth in this market to the extent we continue to see attractive opportunities in brazil first quarter originations declined 13 year over year on a constant currency basis due to a difficult comparison to a strong q1 of last year in addition we intentionally slowed originations in brazil while we reconfigured certain operational practices to deal with new debiting practices implemented by the banks there brazil is one of our smaller businesses but we continue to see a large opportunity there with a huge population growing middle class and stable regulatory environment lastly enova decisions our real time analytics as a service business continues to develop their product offering and outreach to potential customers while this business remains in the early stages we still believe there are opportunities for us to use our sophisticated data and analytics to help other businesses with their decisioning before i wrap up i want to provide a brief regulatory update in march a federal judge ordered a stay on the august 2019 compliance date for the small dollar rule as you know earlier this year the cfeb announced it is revisiting the ability to repay portions of that rule the judge s stay also covers the payment provision in the rule right now it remains unclear how long that stay will remain and whether the payment provisions will also be revisited by the cfeb as with the ability to repay provision we believe the flexibility of our online platform diversified product offerings and our extensive experience navigating regulatory changes positions us well to succeed regardless of the outcome of the rulemaking and the litigation at the state level the california legislature is once again considering a number of bills dealing with consumer credit we have consistently supported good regulations based on facts that help consumers for example the senate banking committee in california passed a bill which we support that proposed a set of consumer oriented protections without restrictive rate caps our team will stay engaged as these bills progress through the summer in california separately oklahoma just passed a new installment lending bill which will open up a nice new product opportunity for us there when it takes effect next year overall we re off to a strong start in 2019 and are raising our outlook for the year as steve will describe in more detail as we have demonstrated we will continue to manage the business to effectively balance growth and profitability we believe our diversified revenue streams talented employees advanced technology world class analytics platform and strong competitive position set us up very well for the remainder of 2019 and beyond with that i ll turn the call over to steve who will provide more details on our financials and guidance and following his remarks we ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have steve steve cunningham chief financial officer thank you david and good afternoon everyone i ll start by reviewing our financial and operating performance for the first quarter of 2019 and then provide our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2019 as david mentioned we are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial results with revenue in the middle of our guidance range and adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share exceeding our guidance financial results reflect our typical first quarter seasonality with sequential declines in originations receivables and revenue which contribute to strong bottom line profitability in fact net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share this quarter are all quarterly records for enova as a public company total first quarter 2019 revenue increased 15 to 293 million above the midpoint of our guidance range of 280 million to 300 million on a constant currency basis revenue increased 16 year over year revenue growth was driven by a 16 year over year increase in total company combined loan and finance receivables balances which grew to 980 million from 844 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018 installment loan and line of credit products continue to drive the growth in total loans and finance receivables balances total quarterly originations decreased 3 year over year which was primarily driven by our continued diversification to installment and line of credit products lower originations in our international businesses and currency headwinds total domestic originations increased 10 year over year compared to the year ago quarter as consumer line of credit originations rose 34 and small business originations increased 58 installment loans receivables purchase agreements and line of credit products now comprise nearly 84 of our total revenue and 93 of our total portfolio demonstrating our customers preference for these products domestic revenue increased 21 on a year over year basis and declined 4 sequentially to 258 million in the first quarter of 2019 domestic revenue accounted for 88 of our total revenue in the first quarter again this sequential decline in revenue is typical seasonality for our u s business revenue growth in our domestic operations was driven by a 33 year over year increase in line of credit revenue and a 17 increase in installment loan and rpa revenue continued strong demand for these products drove our domestic combined loan and finance receivables balances up 21 year over year international revenue decreased 15 from the year ago quarter to 35 million primarily due to the aforementioned repositioning of our u k business as well as currency headwinds on a constant currency basis international revenue decreased 8 on a year over year basis international revenue accounted for 12 of total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 total international loans decreased 13 compared to a year ago international installment loan balances increased 4 year over year while international short term loan balances decreased 47 year over year on a constant currency basis international loan balances decreased 5 year over year turning to gross profit margins our first quarter gross profit margin for the total company was near the high end of our guidance range expectations at 53 this compares to 57 in the year ago quarter as we have described in the past we typically see gross profit margin in the upper end of our guidance range during the first quarter of the year as we experience seasonally lower growth typical of this seasonality our gross profit margin improved from 43 in the fourth quarter of 2018 total company gross profit margin continues to reflect the solid credit quality of the portfolio overall the credit performance of the portfolio is stable and in line with our expectations we continually monitor the marginal and portfolio economics across our products and vintages and remain pleased with the returns we re generating on our originations net charge offs as a percentage of average combined loan and finance receivables increased in the first quarter to 15 8 from 13 7 in the prior year quarter this increase was expected given the rising proportion of new customers in our portfolio over the past several quarters and was reflected in our ratio of allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of gross loan and financing receivables at the end of the previous quarter which was 15 7 as david mentioned originations from new customers across all of our businesses were 26 of the total during the first quarter equal to the proportion from the year ago quarter at the end of the first quarter the allowance and liability for losses for the consolidated company as a percentage of combined gross loan and financing receivables was 14 6 compared to the year ago quarter of 13 7 the increase reflects the expectation of continued seasoning of new customer receivables originated in recent quarters for 2019 we continue to expect our consolidated gross profit margin to be in the range of 45 to 55 quarter to quarter our gross profit margin will be influenced by seasonality and growth characteristics including the pace of growth in originations the mix of new versus returning customers in originations and the mix of loans and financings in the portfolio our domestic gross profit margin was 56 in the first quarter compared to 59 in the first quarter of 2018 and 43 in the fourth quarter of 2018 our international gross profit margin was 28 in the first quarter compared to 51 in the prior year quarter the decrease in international gross profit margin from the year ago quarter was driven primarily by the seasoning of new customer originations in recent quarters and by the change in gross profit margin for international installment loans which reflects the recent growth of new customers from the purposeful repositioning of our u k business to focus on installment offerings as david mentioned earlier we expect our international gross profit margin in 2019 to be in the range of 45 to 55 slightly lower than our previous guidance as we grow and attract new customers in our international installment businesses as a reminder quarter to quarter the international gross profit margin will be influenced by seasonality and growth characteristics including the pace of growth in originations the mix of new versus returning customers in originations and the mix of loans and financings in the portfolio efficient marketing and operating leverage in our scalable online model contributed to our ability to generate record quarterly levels of profit while meeting customer demand during the first quarter of 2019 total operating expenses including marketing were 83 million or 28 of revenue compared to 80 million or 32 of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 we continue to see efficiency in our marketing spend marketing expenses in the first quarter declined 15 year over year to 24 million or 8 of revenue compared to 28 million or 11 of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 we expect marketing spend will range in the low to mid teens percentage of revenue in 2019 with the highest spend during our seasonal growth periods in the second half of the year operations and technology expenses totaled 30 million or 10 of revenue in the first quarter compared to 26 million or 10 of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 and were higher primarily from volume related variable expenses including ongoing expenses associated with complaints in the u k general and administrative expenses were 30 million or 10 of revenue in the first quarter compared to 27 million or 11 of revenue in the first quarter of the prior year and were higher primarily from higher personnel related expenses adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure reached a quarterly record of 75 million and increased 10 year over year in the first quarter our adjusted ebitda margin was 25 5 compared to 26 7 in the first quarter of the prior year our stock based compensation expense was 3 1 million in the first quarter which compares to 2 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was 22 5 in the first quarter compared to a 20 8 rate in the first quarter of 2018 we expect our ongoing normalized effective tax rate to be in the mid 20 range net income increased to 35 million or 1 02 per diluted share in the first quarter from net income of 27 9 million or 0 81 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings a non gaap measure increased to 39 9 million or 1 16 per diluted share from 35 4 million or 1 02 per diluted share in the first quarter of the prior year we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position with strong operating cash flows and meaningful available capacity in our financing facilities during the first quarter cash flows from operations totaled 222 million and we ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 93 million and total debt of 792 million our debt balance at the end of the quarter includes 99 million outstanding under our 350 million of combined installment loan securitization facilities and no amount outstanding under our 125 million corporate revolver now i d like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2019 we expect to see our typical seasonality quarterly seasonality during 2019 as we move through the year seasonal demand in originations typically increase from the first quarter low point and peak during the fourth quarter as we move into our faster growth periods seasonality typically generates sequential revenues that rise faster than adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as growth related provisioning lowers gross margins and outpaces scale benefits our outlook also reflects an expectation of continued faster growth relative growth in installment and line of credit products stable credit steady growth in the mix of new customers and originations no significant impacts to our businesses from regulatory changes and no significant volatility in the british pound from current levels as noted in our earnings release in the second quarter of 2019 we expect total revenue to be between 265 million and 285 million diluted earnings per share to be between 0 41 and 0 63 per share adjusted ebitda to be between 45 million and 55 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between 0 48 and 0 70 per share full year we continue to expect total revenue to be between 1 25 billion and 1 31 billion and are revising our full year profitability higher based on first quarter performance we now expect diluted earnings per share to be between 2 83 and 3 48 per share adjusted ebitda to be between 237 million and 267 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between 3 17 and 3 82 per share as david mentioned we remain well positioned and are very optimistic about our ability to generate growth and increase profitability for the remainder of 2019 and with that we would be happy to take your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you your first question will be coming from john hecht from jefferies please go ahead john hecht jefferies analyst good afternoon thanks guys i really just want to focus on the line of credit versus the installment loans both of them had good year over year growth but it s clear that in terms of origination trends and this and that that there s been higher factors tied to the line of credit i m wondering are those tied to some marketing strategic marketing changes or consumer demand or are you just seeing different geographic pockets david fisher chief executive officer so i think what you re seeing there is especially in counts as opposed to dollar amounts it s a big shift and it s really over the last several years in our subprime business from short term products to line of credit products it s the combination of states passing new line of credit laws opening up availability for us as well as us expanding into states that didn t have didn t prior have line of credit or short term products that now do have or single pay products that do have line of credit products so certainly in terms of counts because those are relatively small loan sizes those have the biggest impacts in installment you ll see that that s somewhat muted in terms of dollar amounts because of our larger net credit loans which is actually one of our fastest growing businesses as you ve seen over the last year or two john hecht jefferies analyst ok then maybe can you talk about what s say over the last year with respect to average balance of line of credit versus installment loan what s happened steve cunningham chief financial officer our average balances haven t really meaningfully changed over the past year john john hecht jefferies analyst ok so it s mix ok then you talked about the international gross margin i guess it was impacted this year relative to last year on a few factors and then you talked about the recovery over the course of the year how fast do you expect that to recover is that just a one quarter migration as you move things in the u k or is there something longer term david fisher chief executive officer it s definitely longer term it s a pretty big shift for us from the short term product to the installment product and as any product ramps up you obviously are booking a lot of those losses from new customers upfront and that will take many quarters to normalize it s really until the growth slows pretty meaningfully long term it s a great thing as we ve talked above customers really seem to like this new installment product it does have a very wide range of aprs as well as a wide range of loan sizes to that flexibility seems to be really resonating in the u k so we ve seen strong adoption stronger than we expected and that s what led to the drop in the gross margins there john hecht jefferies analyst relative to our model just much better leveraging of various expenses including marketing maybe can you give us a sense for how you re deploying marketing budget any changes to the different channels there and any different kind of efficacy rates and response rates you re seeing in these channels david fisher chief executive officer we saw decent rates in q1 again q1 is more typical seasonality i mean that s what we saw that s what we typically saw in the past last year was definitely an anomaly it was a surprise to us i think surprised everybody so we re kind of getting back to that we pulled way back in marketing in q1 this year we just pulled back a little bit more as we ve entered q2 we ve definitely seen a strengthening demand of demand post tax return season as would be expected and we are clearly leaning into the marketing i think over the last couple of years the big growth has been on the direct mail side and i think now we re seeing good success in tv actually and so we re leaning in on the tv side but these are fairly minor and longer term mix shifts in terms of marketing they re not dramatic they re not overnight but they have had the effect over say the last three to five years of greatly reducing our reliance on lead providers and controlling our destiny much more in terms of attracting new customers john hecht jefferies analyst guys thanks very much and congrats on a good quarter operator thank you your next question comes from david scharf jmp securities go ahead please david scharf jmp securities analyst thank you and thanks for taking my questions this afternoon david i wanted to actually follow up on the prior questions and discussion on marketing it s become pretty clear that you guys have demonstrated that the model has an awful lot of flexibility in terms of kind of managing to your earnings guidance particularly by throttling or pulling back on marketing spend i m just wondering just to give us maybe a broader sense for how to think about the range of marketing spend from quarter to quarter i know you ve given guidance as a percentage of revenue for the year but based on the scale you re at now is 23 5 million i mean should we think of that as a floor on quarterly spend that anything below that can t sustain this kind of growth david fisher chief executive officer yes so a couple of things good question we did not pull back on marketing in q1 to try to achieve higher profitability we generated above our guidance range and profitability just through normal operations we tried to make sure we were hitting our return thresholds with our marketing and not exceeding them and just given the lower levels of demand because of the tax return season that s where marketing played out so unlike q4 where we purposefully pulled back because of extremely strong levels of new customer growth we did not do that in q1 but still saw one of our lowest percentages of marketing marketing as a percentage of revenue we ve ever seen and so i would not expect in the future marketing in either absolute dollars or as a percentage of revenue to get much below that number that was a very very low number in terms of the ranges we would be very comfortable spending mid to upper teens as a percentage of revenue for marketing in a given quarter we found some opportunities to accelerate that kind of in the middle of last year and it paid off so well that we ended up having to pull back in the back quarter of the year the last quarter of the year right now we re seeing some good opportunities to deploy marketing dollars as we have kind of exited the tax return season and kind of moved into growth season again and that s why kind of our guidance for marketing for the year hasn t changed a lot we think we can deploy more marketing dollars throughout the year and we would like to if we can because that s great growth for the future every marketing dollar we spend we think we re spending at attractive unit economics and generating good returns for the business so if you re thinking about a range we would not expect to go below where we were in q1 certainly not in the back three quarters of year but really like in any quarter going forward although crazy things can happen and we will be happy to spend kind of in the upper teens if we find the right opportunities in some of the more growth quarters david scharf jmp securities analyst that s real helpful going forward hey maybe a question just a point of clarification i wanted to make sure i understood the commentary on international gross margins because on the one hand i thought i heard that the full year guidance was modestly trimmed a couple of percentage points but still in the 45 to 55 range yet a little later i thought david you may have said that those margins aren t going to snap back overnight off that 28 level in the first quarter and i m trying to reconcile those if you could comment on how to think about the trend over the course of the year steve cunningham chief financial officer yes david this is steve i think over the course of the year you ll see some of the return there but again it s not it won t be overnight that s really what david was talking about as we re making some of these transitions and purposeful repositioning so expect to see that but as i talked about in my commentary it s also going to depend on how fast we re growing if there is deviations from our new versus returning as we re looking to the future so that s probably the best way to think about it it was a fairly meaningful reduction we brought it down 5 points but again you should expect to see some normalization based on our best view going forward today david scharf jmp securities analyst ok got it then hey lastly for you steve this is more just sort of a mechanical question but it looks like your ebitda guidance for the year was taken up by 7 million both at the high and the low end yet the earnings guidance went up by about 0 40 which by my calculation that s roughly like 18 million pre tax sort of wondering is there sort of an 11 million reduction in sort of below the operating line assumptions i can take it offline if it s easier but i was just trying to reconcile steve cunningham chief financial officer really below ebitda the big two levers are financing and tax so i think our tax view has been pretty steady but we did expect to have maybe a slightly lower balance sheet than we did going into the year so if there s lower size balance sheet you have a lower level of financing needed against that so that s really the leverage you see below the ebitda line and we also had some mix shifts across our financing instruments as well david scharf jmp securities analyst all right operator thank you thank you i would now like to turn the conference back to david fisher for any closing remarks david fisher chief executive officer great

central bank independence is increasingly at risk around the world in the u s president donald trump reportedly still plans to nominate political allies to the federal reserve even after potential nominee herman cain withdrew in the face of stiff opposition in italy the government proposed seizing control of banca italia s approximately us 100 billion in gold reserves which it reportedly would use to fund spending plans and has threatened the central bank s independence in other ways they re not alone governments and lawmakers in turkey the u k india and elsewhere have been steadily eroding the bedrock idea that a central bank should be left alone to manage the economy based on evidence and data not political goals this is motivating numerous commentators to write farewell notes for the concept of central bank independence while it is incredibly hard to build a sound central bank that is trusted it is even harder to do so after its credibility has been corroded i agree with their concern and find government interference deeply troubling that s because a large body of economic research makes it quite clear placing monetary policy into the hands of an independent central banker who bases decisions on evidence and data instead of populist ideals leads to lower inflation and greater economic stability key ingredients of a strong economy and as i know from research i ve done with a variety of colleagues political meddling comes with a hefty price tag while it is incredibly hard to build a sound central bank that is trusted by investors and citizens it is even harder to do so after its credibility has been corroded the promise of easy credit there s a reason politicians like to gain control over a central bank it s a powerful institution that literally supplies constituents with cheap money via lower interest rates creating jobs and boosting growth in the process at least in the short term to underscore the kind of weaponry central banks bring to bear economists and journalists use the term bazooka to describe their firepower and with populists taking power across the globe on promises of endless economic prosperity governments are tempted to use this bazooka to help meet them attempts to manipulate interest rates or to regain control over monetary policy for political gain is effectively undermining this credibility lowering interest rates is one such weapon another is the ability to essentially create money out of thin air even though technically central banks don t print cash this can help governments fill budget shortfalls and fund new spending programs presumably in the hope of more votes on election day economists call the ability to withstand such political pressures and steer the financial side of an economy in a consistent manner monetary credibility attempts to manipulate interest rates or to regain control over monetary policy for political gain is effectively undermining this credibility the price of political meddling a few historical examples show what can happen when a government meddles with a central bank in 1971 u s president richard nixon successfully pressured federal reserve chair arthur burns to lower interest rates which juiced up the economy and helped him win reelection the following year americans paid dearly for nixon s victory however as the low interest rates helped fuel double digit inflation throughout most of the 1970s and hurt the value of the u s dollar the fed s efforts to fight these rising prices with higher interest rates resulted in two recessions political interference in monetary policymaking can have even worse effects in countries that rely heavily on international investors to fund governments and the private sector hungary s decision to revoke its central bank s independence in 2011 prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade the country s debt to junk status this caused the currency to fall to record lows drove the economy into recession and pushed the country to the brink of default in argentina almost a third of its citizens are in poverty thanks in part to decades of central bank meddling in argentina almost a third of its citizens are in poverty thanks in part to out of control inflation a problem decades of central bank meddling largely caused and it doesn t take actual interference to have disastrous consequences in his attempt to mobilize popular pressure for lower interest rates president recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly attacked the bank of turkey and called interest rates the mother of all evil although the bank has resisted bending to his will the turkish lira and the country s financial markets have been on a roller coaster ride causing economic turmoil credibility lost is hard to recover undoing the consequences of political meddling and restoring faith in a central bank and the country s currency often requires a lot of short term pain primarily this takes the guise of rising interest rates even if the economy is in trouble this is a sure recipe for recession that s what happened in the 1980s as then fed chair paul volcker tried to restore the bank s credibility and bring inflation under control the fed raised rates to a record 20 in the process pushing the u s economy into recession twice the bank of turkey has hiked interest rates to 24 in attempts to fend off further rounds of speculative attacks on the lira and hang on to its credibility the economy is suffering as a result put bluntly political meddling with central banks is an incredibly bad and dangerous idea and in argentina although the current government says it believes in central bank independence banco central de la república argentina continues to struggle with the legacy of rampant inflation with only sky high interest rates likely to put it in check more economic pain is likely the experiences of central and eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall are further testimony of this long and often painful road to monetary credibility something today s populist movements might want to bear in mind put bluntly political meddling with central banks is an incredibly bad and dangerous idea this article is

by barrington m salmon nnpa newswire contributor disney heiress abigail disney is the latest critic of the vast disparity between workers and business executives to level intense and passionate criticism at a system that allows ceos to rake in unbelievable amounts of cash stock options and benefits while ordinary workers languish in stagnation in tweets and a recent op ed in the washington post disney excoriated disney ceo bob iger who made 65 million in 2018 which is 1 424 times greater than the median income of the average disney worker it is time to call out the men and women who lead us and to draw a line in the sand about how low we are prepared to let hardworking people sink while top management takes home ever more outrageous sums of money disney wrote in the opinion piece it is unreasonable to expect corporate boards to act as a check on this trend they are almost universally made up of ceos former ceos and people who long to be ceos to put that gap in context in 1978 the average ceo made about 30 times a typical worker s salary since 1978 ceo pay has grown by 937 percent while the pay of an average worker grew just 11 2 percent this growth in inequality has affected every corner of american life disney granddaughter of roy disney co founder of the legendary company with his brother walt is a philanthropist activist founder of peace is loud and co founder of level forward a start up that backs media projects of women and people of color to develop films podcasts stage shows and related projects at the pay levels we are talking about an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life she said for the people at the bottom it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt it could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child disney appealed to the moral conscience of the walt disney co leadership lead if any of this rings any moral bells for you know that you are uniquely situated to model a different way of doing business she wrote you do not exist merely for the benefit of shareholders and managers reward all the people who make you successful help rebuild the american middle class and respect the dignity of the men and women who work just as hard as you do to make disney the amazing company it is nobel prize winning economist joseph e stiglitz agreed with disney telling democracy now s amy goodman and juan gonzalez in an april 24 interview that capitalism hasn t been working for most americans for the last 40 years she s absolutely right you mentioned that in the late 70s it was 30 to one on average today it s over 300 to one said stiglitz a columbia university professor professor and chief economist at the roosevelt institute and former chairman of the council of economic advisers under president bill clinton and it s not as if our ceos have gotten 10 times as productive in those intervening years it s not as if you know american ceos get paid so much more than their workers relative to those in europe and even more relative to those in japan and it s not because our ceos are that much more productive it s because we have a real problem in our corporate governance laws in our norms that allow them to take away that much money stiglitz author of a new book people power and profits progressive capitalism for an age of discontent said using ceo bonus money to share the wealth among disney employees as disney suggests would make a significant difference to workers that money could also have gone into investment he said you know one of the striking things about the united states today is that while the rates of return are very very high relative to what they ve been in the past the levels of investment have been low so you would have thought those two would have gone together but with ceo pay and share buybacks being so large trillion dollars of share buybacks last year the money isn t going either to workers or to investment the widening wage gap and widespread disparities have been news lately with rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny vermont sen bernie sanders billionaire investor warren buffett entrepreneur and venture capitalist nick hanaeur activists from the left progressives and others leading the charge against and warning about the consequences of the excesses of the uber rich ocasio cortez a freshman legislator has proposed a 70 percent tax on incomes over 10 million while sen elizabeth warren posited a wealth tax of 2 percent for those whose net worth exceeds 50 million and sanders has suggested increasing the estate tax for estates above 1 billion so that children of billionaires do not unfairly reap the windfalls regular americans don t get all of which has caused consternation in wealthy circles they have been increasing critical of a republican tax cut in 2017 that transferred about 1 2 trillion of wealth from the middle class to the super rich and politicians and a business elite who have done little to address and alleviate the financial challenges that face their workers in 2018 the united way released data collected over 10 years that offers a disturbing snapshot of where the united states stands since the 2008 recession ended the alice asset limit income constrained employed project shows that almost 51 million americans make less than what s needed to survive in the modern economy stephanie hoopes the project s senior researcher said that number includes 16 1 million households living in poverty as well as the 34 7 million families that fall under the alice classification that translates to what she said is a staggering 43 percent of american households that can t afford basics such as food child care health care transportation and a cell phone there are many different alice stories some people are in different situations because of health problems natural disasters and a number of other issues hoopes said usually people who are in this field totally understand the magnitude of this problem the cause is a mismatch between basic elements of the average household budget and what people are making housing childcare food transportation and healthcare are increasing faster than inflation overall and faster than wages increasing wages would help offset fluctuating wages unpredictable hours and workhours incompatible with childcare america s working class is caught in an economic vice fueled by decades of stagnant wages the weakening of organized labor by republican lawmakers gaming of the system by politicians and corporations minimum wages for fast food and service jobs employees unemployment the spiraling cost of food medicine and rent gentrification foreclosures and the severe shortage of affordable housing dr elise gould a senior researcher at the washington d c based economic policy institute epi said research conducted by epi experts scholars and researchers corroborates the united way findings there are a lot of people working who are still in poverty said dr gould whose areas of expertise include wages poverty jobs healthcare and economic mobility we put data out titled 50 years after the poor people s campaign poverty persists because of a stingy safety net and a dysfunctional labor market which shows that a number of americans living in poverty who may be in school or retired but two thirds are otherwise employable of those 63 percent are working and 45 5 percent of them work fulltime stiglitz said the promise of decent well paying jobs a sturdy social safety net and retirement security has faded and the social contract between politicians corporations and the public is increasingly being ignored people need more jobs jobs that have more hours and the pay needs to be higher what people are earning is simply insufficient we also need a better safety net for caregivers and students stiglitz said in an article titled the american economy is rigged and what we can do about it it seems like people are working really hard and low income workers are more educated than ever before but the data make it clear that millions of people who are active participants in the labor market are unable to make ends meet either due to insufficient hours or low wages the basic perquisites of a middle class life including a secure old age are no longer attainable for most americans stiglitz continued we need to guarantee access to health care we need to strengthen and reform retirement programs which have put an increasing burden of risk management on workers who are expected to manage their portfolios to guard simultaneously against the risks of inflation and market collapse and which opened them up to exploitation by our financial sector which sells them products designed to maximize bank fees rather than retirement

her wellbeing the communications and public relations veteran said she has been living an increasingly precarious existence since discovering that she has breast cancer four years ago i was very blessed when i was diagnosed with cancer because i had a good job and good insurance with an 80 20 split meaning 20 percent of the costs are borne by me said hunt a howard university graduate who has been in her career field for 30 years i was paying 200 a month for four whole years to one doctor this has affected everything with me it s scary even though i have a great insurance i still had to pay cash acupuncture is no longer covered and i haven t even begun to figure how to pay for radiation i m thinking i may wait for the full seven years when my credit is clear and start from there it s certainly taken a toll on my standard of living i know so many friends with no insurance and the consequences for them have been so much worse what they re dealing with has knocked people out of the middle class one serious illness being unemployed for several months a year or us baby boomers not being hired all this affects one s ability to stay in the middle class what i see among my peers is that they are jammed up deciding whether they are going to eat or pay bills

since attempting to stage a recovery and rising to a high at 1314 70 on the june comex futures contract on april 10 the price of gold has moved lower and below the 1300 level the last time the yellow metal was over 1300 was on april 11 and after falling to a low at 1267 90 on april 23 june futures were at the 1279 level on wednesday april 24 not far off the recent low gold is a metal that tends to move higher during periods of uncertainty and lower when market participants are feeling good about other asset classes the recent rebound in the stock market that put the leading indices above their 2018 peaks has taken some of the shine off of the price of gold at the same time higher interest rates in the us and a dollar that is sitting just below its mid december high on the dollar index have weighed on the price of the precious metal i have been trading in the gold market since 1981 in the late 1980s and 1990s i ran one of the world s leading precious metals businesses with offices in new york london hong kong and other cities in asia even though the price of gold traded at a much lower price level in those days one thing has remained the same when gold looks its best it is usually time to sell and when it looks like it is going to explode to the upside it is typically a great time to sell the most direct route for a trade or investment position in the gold market is via the physical bars and coins available from dealers around the world the allocated and unallocated gold market in london is the most liquid physical choice which attracts the world s producers consumers central banks governments and monetary authorities who buy and sell the yellow metal in significant quantities the comex division of the cme offers futures and futures options in gold with a physical delivery mechanism the ability to make or take delivery of gold bars allows for the smooth convergence between the prices of the futures and physical during delivery periods many etf and etn products that are both unleveraged and leverages do an excellent job replication the price of the yellow metal shares in gold mining stocks typically act as leveraged tools in the gold market as the share prices often outperform the price action in gold on the upside and underperform on the downside each mining company has idiosyncratic risks such as their management and the locations of mines around the world aside from the political risk of producing gold in a myriad of countries mining companies also run the risk of property specific issues such as floods in mines inconsistencies between proven and probable reserves and output and others a bundle or diversified portfolio of mining stocks can mitigate some of the idiosyncratic risks and the vaneck vectors gold miners etf product gdx or the vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf product gdxj tend to provide leveraged returns in a rising and falling gold market as they hold a portfolio of mining shares the products temper some of the risks when it comes to holding a position in a specific mining company gold falls to the lowest level of 2019 gold continued to fall to new lows for 2019 on tuesday april 23 when the price reached 1267 90 per ounce on the nearby june comex futures contract source cqg as the daily chart shows gold looks awful as it has made a new low for 2019 over the past four out of six trading sessions on april 23 the yellow metal fell to its lowest level since december 20 on the june contract the next level of technical support is at the december 19 low at 1249 per ounce open interest tells us about herd behavior open interest is the total number of open long and short positions in a futures market the metric tends to rise when trends develop and fall when speculators and investors exit risk positions in the world of precious metals where sentiment is a primary force that drives prices open interest can be an effective indicator of what market participants are doing with the price of gold falling the metric is telling us that they have moved to other markets that offer more opportunity since march source cqg the daily chart with volume and open interest metrics show that after rising to a high at 541 737 contracts on march 14 the metric declined to 440 048 contracts on april 23 a drop of 101 689 contracts or just under 19 gold rose to a high at 1330 80 on march 25 and fell to 1267 90 on april 23 which was 62 90 or 4 7 lower as the price of gold the open interest metric is at its lowest level of 2019 and has not been this low since late december of last year falling price and declining open interest is typically not a validation of an emerging bearish trend in a futures market gold open interest rose with the price and fell with the price the open interest metric displays a pattern of rising with the price of gold and falling during corrective periods market participants tend to hop on board of the gold market when the price is appreciating and jump off when the price moves to the downside from late november 2018 through late january when gold was moving to the upside the metric rose from 390 899 to 537 605 contracts open interest remained between 470 000 and 541 737 contracts until late march but the move to new lows for this year in april drove the metric lower the falling open interest metric may not validate a continuation of lower lows in gold because the decline could mean that the futures market is coming close to a level where it will run out of selling early in my career a boss who ran the precious metals trading business for a leading world trading company told me that gold and silver move higher when there are more buyers than sellers and lower when sellers outnumber buyers at the time the lesson seemed almost too simplistic but what he was attempting to convey was that the two precious metals move on sentiment and herd behavior is the primary force when it comes to trends while the metric can continue to decline with the price at under 400 000 contracts a bottom could be in the cards for the yellow metal on a short to medium term basis the long term trend in gold is bullish in all currencies but the dollar is currently pushing the price lower the latest correction in the gold market is coming as the yellow metal is taking cues from the dollar index which has risen back over the 97 level as of april 24 source cqg as the weekly chart of the dollar index futures contract shows the critical level on the upside for the dollar is at the mid december 2018 peak at 97 705 since then the dollar has made multiple attempts to climb to a new high but on each occasion it failed at 97 670 on april 24 another attempt to conquer the resistance level is currently underway the inverse historical relationship between the dollar and the price of gold is currently weighing on the price of the precious metal as it is at the lows of 2019 however a look at longer term charts of gold in dollar terms and gold in the other leading reserve currencies of the world shows that the trend for at least a decade is higher source cqg the quarterly chart of gold in dollar terms displays a bullish trend that has been in place since the price reached a low at 252 50 per ounce in 1999 when the bank of england decided to liquidate half of their reserves source cqg the monthly chart of gold in euros shows that gold has appreciated dramatically since the turn of this century source cqg meanwhile the price of gold in japanese yen shows that it has also rallied since the turn of the century and in yen gold is not far off its all time peak the price action in gold when it comes to the three leading reserve currencies of the world provides a reason to pause during the current price correction as the long term trend is telling us that gold continues to gain value versus the world s leading fiat currencies while the bank of england was selling their gold reserves at the start of this century central banks have been net buyers of the yellow metal over recent years china and russia have built reserves by absorbing domestic output and occasionally purchasing gold on the international market there have been very few official sector sales of gold which is a sign that central banks and governments still believe that gold is the ultimate means of exchange a store of value and is an effective reserve asset even though they do not talk about gold often the action of the world s monetary authorities speaks a lot louder than their silence on the subject a higher low is in the cards for the yellow metal a golden opportunity to buy gold mining stocks i am not a gold bug who always believes the price gold is going to move higher but i do think that the yellow metal is the ultimate means of exchange as a student of history the metal has played a leading role as an asset for a lot longer than any currency currently in circulation for thousands of years gold has remained a constant symbol of wealth and it continues to receive validation from governments who hold the metal as part of their foreign exchange reserve assets gold currently looks like it is heading lower which in my experience has always been the perfect time to begin accumulating the yellow metal while most market participants tend to purchase gold as it is moving higher i have found that a scale down buying approach has optimized my results i prefer to sell gold on a scale up basis when the market becomes overpopulated with buyers the open interest metric has been a great monitor of the behavior of the herd of investors and speculators in the precious metal the recent decline in open interest is a sign that the gold futures market is going to run out of selling sooner rather than later gold mining shares provide a leveraged return on the up and the downside compared to the price of gold while buying specific mining companies involves idiosyncratic risk i prefer to use the vaneck vectors gold miners etf product for a leveraged position in gold or the vaneck vectors junior gold miners etf product for even more gearing as the juniors tend to move more on a percentage basis that the leading gold mining companies with open interest falling this could be the perfect time to begin building long positions in gdx and gdxj for the time when the selling stops and gold finds a bottom the price of gold has

ltd pan american silver and yamana gold which account for over 30 of the etf s holdings gdxj has net assets of 3 9 billion and trades an average of over 13 million shares each day a higher low may be in the cards for the gold market as it looks ugly enough to buy these days gdx and gdxj provided leveraged performance on the downside and are likely to do the same on the upside buying the mining etfs on a scale down basis could be the optimal strategy as gold searches for a low when open interest falls to a level where the market runs dry of selling

april 22 financial times hudson lockett and yizhen jia chinese stocks fell on monday amid concerns that beijing may renew a campaign against shadow banking that contributed to a heavy sell off across the market last year analysts pinned much of the blameâ on a statement issued late on friday following a politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping in beijing they were particularly alarmed by a term that surfaced in state media reports of the meeting of top communist party leaders deleveraging that word set off alarm bells among investors still hurting from beijing s campaign against leverage in the country s financial system last year those reforms focused largely on so called shadow banking which before the clampdown saw lenders channel huge sums of money to fund managers who then invested it in stocks and tuesday from bloomberg intelligence qian wan and chang shu the central financial and economics affairs commission cfeac the communist party s top policy body headed by president xi jinping is focused on ongoing structural reform and deleveraging citing proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy as key tools officials set a pragmatic growth target of 6 0 6 5 for 2019 the government plan also indicated credit growth in line with that of nominal gdp in 2019 echoing the people s bank of china s statement of maintaining macro leverage the shanghai composite was hammered 5 6 this week after last year s scare markets have good reason to fret the prospect of a return of chinese deleveraging and the pboc restricting the floodgates i would add that if beijing actually plans to manage credit growth to be in line with nominal gdp the entire world has a big problem over the past year china s nominal gdp increased about 7 5 meanwhile chinese aggregate financing expanded at a double digit annualized rate during q1 this would imply a meaningful deceleration of credit growth through the remainder of the year don t expect that to go smoothly april 23

totaling 43 7 billion faced repayment pressure as of last week a 25 jump from the tally at the end of marchâ the debt crisis at conglomerates can have more of a contagion impact on the corporate bond market compared with an average corporate default because those issuers typically have more creditors and large amount of outstanding debt said li kai a multi strategy investment director at genial flow asset management co chinese officials surely appreciate the risks associated with rampant debt growth they have carefully studied the japanese experience and they have surely studied the history of financial crises beijing has had ample time to research bubbles yet they still have limited actual experience with credit booms and busts china has no experience with mortgage finance and housing bubbles they have never before managed an economy with a massively leveraged corporate sector with much of the borrowings via marketable debt issuance they have no experience with a multi trillion us money market complex and minimal with derivatives they have zero experience with a banking system that has inflated to about 40 tn financing a wildly imbalanced and structurally impaired economy not to mention fraud and malfeasance of epic proportions i m not confident beijing comprehends how deranged credit can become late in the cycle a system dominated by asset bubbles and malinvestment over time evolves into a crazed credit glutton keeping the historic chinese apartment bubble levitated will require enormous ongoing cheap credit keeping the incredibly bloated chinese corporate sector afloat will require only more ongoing cheap credit ditto for the frighteningly levered local government sector and the acute and unrelenting pressure on the banking system to support myriad bubbles with generous lending terms will require massive unending banking balance sheet expansion worse yet at this late terminal phase of the cycle it becomes impossible to control the flow of finance it will instinctively flood into speculation and non productive purposes has china studied the late twenties u s experience if beijing is serious about managing risk it has no option other than to move to rein in credit growth last year s market instability economic weakness and difficult trade negotiations forced officials to back off restraint and instead push forward with stimulus measures this had characteristics of a short term gambit chinese officials will not be slamming on the brakes but if they re serious about trying to manage credit and myriad risks it would be reasonable to expect the imposition of restraint upon the completion of u s trade negotiations indeed there are indications that this transition has already commenced if this analysis has merit the global market backdrop is near an important inflection point potentially one of momentous consequence chinese credit growth is about to slow with negative ramifications for global market liquidity and economic expansion i would further argue that the synchronized global everything rally has ensured latent fragilities even beyond those that erupted last year the conventional view that china is now full speed ahead with stimulus resolving myriad issues could prove one of financial history s great episodes of wishful thinking it s worth recalling the 2018 market backdrop after beginning the year with a moonshot emerging markets trading to record highs in late january em turned abruptly lower and trended down throughout much of the year the shanghai composite traded to a high of 3 587 on january 29th only to

periphery supported speculative flows to core u s securities markets u s equities bounced back from february s short vol blowup and went on a speculative run throughout the summer in the face of mounting global instability after trading below 90 for much of april the dollar index had risen to 95 by late may and 97 in mid august while the fed raised rates 25 bps in june and again in september financial conditions remained exceptionally loose ten year treasury yields traded down to 2 80 little changed from early february held down by global fragilities and the surging dollar high yield debt posted positive returns through september ignoring rapidly escalating risks the s p 500 traded right at all time highs to begin the fourth quarter 10 3 the dam soon broke with crisis dynamics coming to fully envelop the core after a several month respite i m back on crisis dynamics watch carefully monitoring for indications of nascent risk aversion and waning liquidity at the periphery last year s market and economic developments provided important confirmation of the global bubble thesis including the fundamental proposition that major bubbles function quite poorly in reverse years of zero rates and qe had inflated myriad bubbles and a highly unbalanced global economy surreptitiously addicted to aggressive monetary stimulus as tepid as it was policy normalization had engendered latent fragilities though this predicament remained hidden so long as risk on held sway over the markets a speculative marketplace gleaned its own 2018 experience thesis confirmation central bankers won t tolerate bursting bubbles the dovish u turn sparked a major short squeeze unwind of bearish hedges and more generally a highly speculative market rally and in global markets dominated by a pool of trillions of trend following and performance chasing finance rallies tend to take on lives of their own with 2019 s surging markets and speculative leverage creating self reinforcing liquidity last year s waning liquidity and december s illiquidity scare are long forgotten but i ll offer a warning liquidity risk lies in wait when risk embracement runs its course and risk aversion begins to reappear it won t be long before anxious sellers outnumber buyers when risk off de risking deleveraging dynamics again attain momentum there will be a scarcity of players ready to accommodate the unwind of speculator leverage and when a meaningful portion of the marketplace decides to hedge market risk there will be a paucity of traders willing to take the other side of such trades and there s an additional important facet to the analysis come the next serious risk off market dislocation a further dovish u turn will not suffice that trump card was played surely earlier than central bankers had envisaged spoon fed markets will demand rate cuts and when rate cuts prove insufficient markets will impatiently clamor for more qe powell s abrupt intermeeting termination of policy normalization carried quite a punch markets were caught off guard with huge amounts of market hedges in place now with markets already anticipating a rate cut this year one wouldn t expect the actual fed announcement in the midst of market instability to elicit a big market reaction the fed is clearly preparing for the next episode where it will be called upon to backstop faltering markets our central bankers will undoubtedly point to disinflation risk and consumer prices drifting below the fed s 2 target i ll expect markets to play along but without the shock effect of spurring a big market reversal with attendant risk embracement and speculative leveraging it s likely that a 25 bps rate cut will have only ephemeral impact on marketplace liquidity markets will quickly demand more qe and chairman powell is right back in the hot seat i m getting ahead of myself here but the reemployment of fed qe should be expected to have unintended consequences depending on relative u s versus global growth dynamics and market performance if as was the case last year king dollar and speculative flows to the core temporarily boost u s output it would be an interesting backdrop for restarting qe but

happened to u s inflation and why it hasn t returned in any meaningful ways as suggested by the economic models the answer matters to the federal reserve s unique status as a central bank with a rare dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices the evidence is mounting that this dual mandate is clouding the fed s judgment especially at a time when the relationship between inflation and employment is being openly questioned congress has changed the mandate before and maybe it should do so again perhaps congress can give the fed a mandate of full employment and financial stability or

to devan ard reliant bancorp s president and ceo please go ahead sir devan ard president and chief executive officer thanks operator good morning and thanks for joining us on this morning s call to review our results for the first quarter of 2019 we appreciate your continued interest in our company s progress loan growth was exceptionally strong in a quarter that is normally slower due to seasonality loans increased 2 5 during the quarter our 15th consecutive quarter of loan growth and a reflection of nashville s ongoing economic expansion we re especially proud that our loan growth represents 100 core high quality loans at attractive yields and that we don t rely on purchased credits to generate growth total loans grew 14 2 to a record 1 26 billion compared with the first quarter of last year loan production remained strong in the first quarter at 116 2 million up 11 6 compared to the fourth quarter 10 stocks we like better than reliant bancorp inc when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and reliant bancorp inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 1 2019 we experienced loan growth across our markets including solid contributions from our new offices in murfreesboro and chattanooga our murfreesboro office opened late in the third quarter and our chattanooga office opened midway through the fourth quarter of last year we re continuing to benefit from a strong and diverse pipeline for new loans entering the second quarter first quarter net income attributable to common shareholders rose slightly to 3 8 million or 0 33 per diluted share compared with the first quarter of last year and down from the fourth quarter of 2018 due mainly to a decline in net interest income because of two fewer days in the quarter compression of our net interest margin in the first quarter and the recognition of a significant tax credit received on a loan originated during the fourth quarter 2018 when the noise from purchase accounting accretion and tax credits is stripped away our core net interest margin remained stable at 3 47 down only 1 basis point from the full year 2018 improvement in core loan yields partially offset our increase in funding cost dan will provide more color later in the call but we shifted our funding mix away from higher cost borrowings to deposits which is why you saw an outsized growth in both balances and costs in our deposit portfolio non interest expenses were up slightly in the quarter as we continue to ramp our new locations in murfreesboro and chattanooga hire revenue producing bankers and invest in the technology we need to serve our customers we expect to generate operating leverage and improved efficiencies as we realize the benefits of these investments as i ve noted in previous quarters the middle tennessee economy remains strong we have branches in seven counties with nashville davidson county at the core and we re well positioned to capture our share of the robust growth in our markets without reducing our focus on quality credits job growth most of which is higher paying white collar jobs continues to drive our economy and despite in migration of about 80 new residents per day the unemployment level is one of the lowest in the country the flourishing tourist industry is fueling significant growth in the hospitality business evidenced by many new hotels in the area revenue per available room and occupancy rates remain very strong supporting the additional capacity we re keenly aware of the boom and bust cycles in the economy so we continue to manage our loan portfolio and new loan production with solid underwriting and risk management practices our focus remains on lending to established home builders real estate developers and small to mid sized business customers we maintained our superior credit profile and do not have any loan loss provision or net charge offs in the quarter and criticized and classified loans fell to a cycle low we remain very positive about our company s future loan demand is strong the economy across our markets remains vibrant and growing and we believe that reliant has additional opportunities to grow organically and through potential acquisitions within our footprint m a is a core competency of our franchise and while i have nothing to report at this time m a will remain a key tenet of our strategic plan i ll now turn the call over to dan dellinger our cfo to review our first quarter results in more detail dan dellinger chief financial officer thanks devan and good morning reliant s first quarter balance sheet demonstrates the progress we ve made in growing loans and deposits over the past year total assets were up 9 3 to 1 8 billion since the first quarter of last year with net loans rising 14 2 to 1 3 billion year over year deposits were up 12 to 1 5 billion year over year as devan mentioned the addition of the new offices in murfreesboro and chattanooga have made a strong contribution to these results with especially good loan growth from our chattanooga location which increased loans by 20 6 million during the first quarter of 2019 new loan originations during the first quarter were a strong 116 million with a 5 62 weighted average rate loans generated in the first quarter were distributed across major segments that included 32 for c i loans 31 for cld loans and 16 for cre loans over the past year we ve put more focus on generating c i loans and this quarter s results highlight our progress in this area many of these new loans are not fully funded at the origination date so they represent future loan growth and interest income as deposits are built out and the loans are funded at march 31 our top 10 closed end construction loans had 39 million left to fund deposits set a new record in the first quarter and were up 12 over the first quarter of last year and up 5 1 from the fourth quarter or a 20 4 annualized growth rate we had solid growth in demand deposits up 7 4 annualized from the fourth quarter our revised incentive plans place a higher priority on core deposit growth time deposits were up 22 4 since the first quarter of last year and up 12 4 since the fourth quarter as devan mentioned seeing an opportunity to reduce our overall cost of funding we grew our time deposits and repaid some of our higher costing federal home loan bank advances this strategy resulted in a reduction of 20 basis points in our funding cost we expect the time deposit growth going forward will be more tied tied more closely with loan growth the state the result of our improved loan yields and shift in funding mix was a relatively stable core net interest margin our gaap reported margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 3 63 down 19 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2018 stripping out the impacts of purchase accounting accretion which declined 4 basis points for the quarter and tax credits which declined 19 basis points quarter over quarter the core net interest margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 3 47 which is down only 1 basis point from the fourth quarter of 2018 remember again that we recognized the full 2018 tax credit benefit of 500 000 from the community development loan originated in december of 2018 year over year net interest margin was down 16 basis points on a gaap basis and 18 basis points on an adjusted basis primarily due to a 58 basis point year over year increase in cost of funds offset by a 32 basis point year over year increase in loan yield our forecast for net interest margin in the second quarter reflects continued improvements in loan yields on originations and the benefit from increased yields on loans originated in recent quarters as devan noted we expect funding cost to stabilize devan also mentioned our continued emphasis on loan quality and that is reflected in our exit credit quality metrics no provision for loan losses was required during this quarter due to a net recovery of 462 000 generating a 2 basis point increase in our reserve total non performing loans were down 20 to 5 1 million compared with 6 4 million in the first quarter of last year total non performing assets were down almost 24 to 6 1 million from the first quarter of 2018 non performing loans to total loans declined 17 basis points to 0 41 in the first quarter of 2019 we also had net recoveries of 462 000 in the first quarter compared with net charge offs of 138 000 in the fourth first quarter of 2018 criticized assets declined 35 or 6 2 million from the first quarter of last year with most of the decline coming at no loss to the bank at the end of the first quarter we had one property in other real estate which is under contract for sale our allowance for loan loss has increased over the past year from 0 88 of total loans at march 31 2018 to 0 9 at march 31 2019 when the unadvertised discount on purchased loans is included our total reserve at march 31 2019 is 1 23 of total loans our credit team remains focused on high quality loans while aggressively pursuing loans that demonstrate early weaknesses at the end of the first quarter of 2019 38 of our loan portfolio carried adjustable interest rates flat with the fourth quarter of 2018 new loan production was more focused on variable rates with 66 of the first quarter s production carrying an adjustable rate competition for high quality commercial loans continues to be fierce in our markets construction loans normally float with time and remain very profitable for us in the fourth in the first quarter 29 of our loan portfolio or 34 million was construction related the outstanding balance of our book of construction loans was 169 million with 102 million remaining to be dispersed non interest income in our retail banking segment was flat with the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018 after removing the impact of the securities gains realized during the first quarter of 2019 efforts to improve the retail banking segment s non interest income continues and although we have experienced some nice improvements in service charges and fees as a result of the community first merger these gains were somewhat offset by a decline in brokerage income year over year non interest expenses for the retail banking segment excluding merger expenses were up 1 6 from the fourth quarter of 2018 and 10 5 year over year the increase in retail non interest expense has been proportionate to asset growth running at 2 2 of assets in the first quarter of 2018 and 2 3 of assets for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the year over year dollar increase was due largely to higher expenses associated with new branches in murfreesboro and chattanooga and investments made to add revenue producing employees and improve technological capabilities our fte year over year remains the same as we continue to hire revenue producing employees in both new and existing markets and staff our new branches we were able to reduce headcount by 17 fte from the day the community first deal closed our tax expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased excuse me decreased to 372 000 compared to 797 000 in the first quarter of last year and a credit of 59 000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 going forward in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be around 14 for purposes of our gaap financial statements the mortgage operation s revenue and expenses are combined with the bank and the holding company then netted out as non controlling interest of a subsidiary in the first quarter of 2019 the mortgage subsidiary generated a net loss of 1 5 million compared with a net loss of 1 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net loss of 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 as a reminder our joint venture partner is solely responsible for funding losses in the mortgage operation gains on mortgage loans sold are 56 4 or up 56 4 from the fourth quarter of 2018 and were down 67 1 compared with the first quarter of 2018 i ll wrap with few comments about our strong capital position reliant s total stockholders equity raised to 215 1 million at the end of the first quarter our capital ratios continue to be very strong with our tier 1 leverage ratio at 9 99 and our total risk based capital at 12 92 as both bank and holding company continue to meet the definition of well capitalized financial institutions finally tangible book value per share grew 0 63 at an annualized rate of 18 6 to 14 21 as of march 31 2019 and tangible capital grew at an annualized rate of 17 7 to 164 million we re returning a portion of these gains to our shareholders via quarterly dividends and our stock buyback program now i d like to turn the call back over to devan devan ard president and chief executive officer thanks dan before i open the call for questions i want to highlight our strategy for growth including m a opportunities focused on loan quality and our outlook for 2019 last quarter i highlighted our updated strategic plan that focuses on growing reliant bank by developing our existing markets to enhance our organic growth potential our new banking centers in murfreesboro and chattanooga were part of this plan and were strong contributors to our first quarter s growth in loans and deposits we re also ramping up our digital channels and making investments in new technology products and services that we expect to increase our wallet and market share we ve also revised our incentive plans to promote core deposit generation this contributed to our growth in demand deposits over the past quarter and will continue to be a focus of our bankers in the future we re evaluating m a opportunities on a regular basis a core competency of our team our ideal partner institution would have assets exceeding 500 million have a stable core deposit base not be a significant drag on our current growth targets and the transaction would be immediately accretive to earnings we would of course consider smaller opportunities as they arise particularly in counties contiguous to nashville and chattanooga there are several good candidates in the markets we serve dan highlighted the progress that we made over the past year in improving asset quality credit quality remains a key factor in our long term strategy and we re committed to maintaining our high credit standards as i stated last quarter we passed on potential loans that did not meet our underwriting standards and have increased our due diligence for many potential credits evaluating not only the credit quality of the deal but the overall market for new projects that are coming online that might impact on the borrower in the future our credit team is led by alan mims who s on the call with us today and will be available to answer your questions and finally late last year our board authorized repurchasing up to 12 million of our shares and we re consistently in the market buying shares back as we move into the second quarter of the year we remain optimistic about loan demand based on our existing pipeline and the sound economic fundamentals in our markets the unemployment rate is low business confidence remains high and our markets continue to generate new jobs at a healthy pace based on our current outlook we expect continued organic growth in 2019 operator that completes my remarks for this morning s call and we ll now open the call for questions questions and answers operator and we ll take our first question today from joe fenech with hovde group please go ahead joe fenech hovde group analyst good morning guys devan ard president and chief executive officer good morning joe joe fenech hovde group analyst devan you have some nice breathing room now it looks like with respect to the loan to deposit ratio i mean you were in good shape before but now even more so down sub 84 just kind of given that and the strength of the market do we maybe see loan growth pick up a little bit here or and just if you can comment on that that d be helpful devan ard president and chief executive officer sure joe we ve kind been growing loans in that 10 to 14 range now for several years and even though we ve got some room for some additional loan growth i think we probably expect to see that low kind of single digit i mean excuse me low double digit range for loan growth for the rest of the year so somewhere in the 10 to 14 range is where we re comfortable right now joe fenech hovde group analyst ok and you have mentioned some the stabilization expect stabilization in funding cost do you mean that as soon as this quarter we ll maybe see funding costs flatten out a bit or are you saying more sort of a gradual decline in the pace of increase in funding cost and then eventually kind of flattening out over the course of the year devan ard president and chief executive officer yes no i think you re going to see it flatten out in the second quarter joe we ve already kind of seen just through the first 24 25 days of this month a flattening out of our deposit cost probably started in march and i don t think you re going to see much if any increase in our deposit cost in the second quarter versus the first quarter we think they ll be stable for the balance of the year unless the fed does something that we don t really see right now joe fenech hovde group analyst so given that comment and maybe the benefit of the nine rate hikes still cycling through on the earning asset side in terms of a benefit and then balance that against maybe some accretion fall off from prior deals it sounds like in terms of reported nim could reported nim go up from here or do you sort of see reported nim and core nim kind of converging with maybe some increase in core nim along the way devan ard president and chief executive officer i think we ll probably see a fairly stable core nim going forward joe there s certainly a possibility since we ve got a lot of loan production that hasn t actually hit the books in terms of fundings yet at yields that are higher than our loan yield right now we may see a slight expansion but we re kind of modeling a nim for the balance of the year that s pretty much in line with what we saw in the first quarter joe fenech hovde group analyst ok and then within that you had some good wins go ahead sorry dan dellinger chief financial officer i m sorry joe i was just going to elaborate for a minute on the margin demand we stated that the core margin would remain relatively stable we will continue to have the tax credits for about 300 000 per quarter and the purchase accounting adjustments will continue at about the same rate that they are right now although they may decline or although they will decline somewhat over the next three quarters joe fenech hovde group analyst ok that s helpful dan thanks and then devan you had some good real good linked quarter deposit growth if you would to kind of ballpark it in terms of percentage that s the drivers of that is it primarily the new offices or is it spread nicely across the footprint i mean how would you characterize the drivers of that linked quarter deposit growth devan ard president and chief executive officer yes it s spread around the footprint joe i mean we re still seeing a lot of competition for deposits as i m sure you re aware in our market but we did have i d say kind of some outsized growth in chattanooga chattanooga has been a has just been a strong generator both of loans and core deposits for us since we opened our full service office down there but if you kind of look around our system in all of our counties economic growth is continuing and so we ve seen growth in all of our markets i do think the increased focus on especially non interest bearing and other low cost relationship deposits in our incentive plans is starting to pay off and we ll continue to build on that as we get through the year we ve got a campaign that we re going to kick off in the second quarter that is kind of targeted to our best most valued customers we re identifying who those are where they are and our plan is to generate either through referrals from our good our most valued customers or just from additional business from them significant growth in core deposits over the next three quarters we ve done that in the past and it was very successful so we ll kind of roll that out around the company this quarter joe fenech hovde group analyst ok and then last one for me on m a devan it seems like a common theme this quarter in terms of the lack of pickup in m a seems to be smaller banks not having adjusted expectations with sort of the market corrections in december and march what have you is that would you say that s also the case in and around the markets you operate in is there sort of a little bit of irrationality on the part of some of these smaller targets devan ard president and chief executive officer yes joe i mean especially with the private banks there s still some of that out there i think we ve been through a couple of quarters now though where these potential partners they kind of know what s going on in the market they understand long term value so i don t know that it s as pervasive as it was a couple of quarters ago we have as we talked about before i mean we ve had an opportunity to get involved in in the last 12 months four different deals and i don t know that pricing was as big an issue as maybe our disciplined approach to m a and we re just not going to do something that doesn t meet our criteria we re not going to make any offers without some fairly good level of due diligence and they ve got to meet the kind of the guidelines that we have out there so i m not going to price a deal that doesn t make sense for our shareholders and for our employees and our customers and i think in the last few quarters that s really been a bigger issue for us than just seller expectations joe fenech hovde group analyst understood all right thank you devan devan ard president and chief executive officer sure operator and our next question will come from stephen scouten with sandler o neill please go ahead devan ard president and chief executive officer good morning stephen unknown speaker hey guys this is actually peter on for stephen devan ard president and chief executive officer hi peter dan dellinger chief financial officer hi peter glad you are able to get on unknown speaker yeah appreciate all the color you guys have given around the nim and deposit costs could you maybe give us a little bit of color on the c i growth this quarter i think that was a bit surprising relative to the last couple of quarters we ve seen more focus on construction can you break out kind of what were the drivers there devan ard president and chief executive officer sure i m going to let alan mims talk about that peter alan mims chief credit officer we ve continued to have more focus trying to diversify the portfolio in some way we picked up a new lender in our out of our chattanooga office kind of late in the quarter he moved a few of his commercial deals over that were about 4 million toward the end of the quarter we also have one other fairly large commercial deal that we booked about mid quarter it s about 5 5 million so those we try to focus on finding those so that we can diversify a good bit and i think with the pickup of the lender in chattanooga he s primarily a commercial lender rather than commercial real estate so i think we ll see some continued diversity coming out of that with his pickup and we continue to look for those and when they come in we aggressively try to book those deals when we can underwrite them and they re appropriate for our risk profile unknown speaker ok that s great and you guys kind of mentioned the continued build out in the new offices can you give us a little bit of color on the hirings you made there and if you expect any additional hirings here in the near term maybe throughout the remainder of 2019 devan ard president and chief executive officer sure and that s not specifically focused on our new offices peter i mean we are consistently recruiting lenders in all of our markets and so if you get look back over the last 12 months we not only brought in a new lender in murfreesboro and one in chattanooga but we added some here in the middle tennessee area as well and the nashville williamson county area so we ll continue to do that we have we kind of targeted two to three new lenders a year we ve got prospects basically out there in all of our markets and where we can pick up somebody who we re comfortable can come on and be immediately productive and that s really key for us we ll bring them in and any market so kind of the real growth markets for us right now would be sumner county davidson county williamson county rutherford county and then down in chattanooga and where we have opportunities to pick up additional talent in those markets we ll certainly do that unknown speaker great thanks so much operator and we will now go to stuart lotz with kbw please go ahead stuart lotz kbw analyst hey guys good morning dan dellinger chief financial officer good morning devan ard president and chief executive officer hi stuart stuart lotz kbw analyst i guess dan one follow up here with i guess with deposit growth a lot of the growth this quarter was from i guess the cds from the state of tennessee what were those brought on at i saw that i think wholesale cds were up about 20 bps linked quarter just curious from a modeling standpoint alan mims chief credit officer yes they were brought on at about 2 25 for the most part on an average basis we try to keep those relatively short but obviously with the increase that we were beginning to see with the federal home loan bank advance rates it made a lot of sense as i mentioned in the script we saved about 20 basis points so that would have put us at about 2 45 or so with the federal home loan bank advances devan ard president and chief executive officer stuart the good news about the state of tennessee and we ve talked about this on other calls that they ve gotten a good bit more efficient in their pricing so over the last quarter we ve actually seen the rates that we re getting from the state of tennessee decline and as we got cds with them that roll over we ve got an opportunity to price those at a little bit lower level stuart lotz kbw analyst appreciate the color there and i guess going forward is that a strategy or how big is that book currently dan dellinger chief financial officer it is right at 300 million 300 million talking about the state of tennessee stuart lotz kbw analyst yes dan dellinger chief financial officer yes 300 million stuart lotz kbw analyst ok got it and i guess one just one more question back to the margin looks like core loan yields moved about 6 basis points higher this quarter and your earlier comments were that you still had some higher priced loans coming on the book that haven t been funded yet and so i was just curious what your outlook for core loans core loan yields is next quarter and the remainder of this year even with a flat curve and it sounds like obviously deposit pricing you expect to pull back a little bit so is it i guess another way to ask it is is there maybe more upside for the core margin from here devan ard president and chief executive officer i think it s certainly possible we re not modeling a big upside right now stuart there are two components in the unfunded portion the production in the first quarter is one where we did 116 million at a weighted average yield of a little bit north of 5 60 so yes you can compare that and that didn t all fund in the first quarter but you can compare that to what our portfolio yield was and then we we also at the end of the quarter we had about 40 million in unfunded closed end construction loans that some of those were originated several quarters ago and they re funding up over time those rates are not all at the 5 62 level i mean some of those were closed say a year ago and they re still in the 5 or sub 5 area but to the extent we ve got floating rate loans out there that are construction related they re all tied to prime and you see those move up as prime moves up so that s kind of a long winded way of saying yes i do think there s a possibility that we could see an expansion in our portfolio yield what we experienced in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter probably not unreasonable to see another 4 or 5 basis points in the second quarter alan mims chief credit officer i can expand on that a little bit too fourth quarter our coupon rates were about 4 85 on average first quarter of 2019 they were 4 95 it s up about 10 basis points quarter over quarter obviously in the fourth quarter we had a lot of noise as it related to the tax credits which represented about 29 basis points which pushed overall yields up to about 5 53 on the portfolio moving forward those are going to be at about 10 basis points which is what we had estimated before and also the purchase accounting is probably going to be around the 10 or 11 10 to 11 basis point range stuart lotz kbw analyst got it thanks and i guess just circling back one more on capital devan i know you mentioned the buyback how active have you been so far i saw that i guess in the period shares were down about 25 000 but just thoughts there and what we can expect over the next few quarters if an m a transaction doesn t come to fruition devan ard president and chief executive officer sure sure i don t know that an m a transaction would have a lot of impact on it the authorized amount was 12 million through the end of the quarter we had repurchased around 35 000 shares we think at the current price level of our stock it s still a good use of our capital so we re continuing to do that we are buying shares every day that we can there are some restrictions on how much you can buy on a daily basis that are related to your average daily volume so can t really get as much as i d like if there was a block available we could certainly take that too but at this point in the cycle we re in there has not been a block a larger block of shares available so we re going to continue to buy back stuart as shares are available unless the stock price spikes and in which case i think we d all be happy with that so stuart lotz kbw analyst got it well thanks for taking my question guys and congrats on a nice quarter alan mims chief credit officer thanks like it operator and it appears there are no further questions so i d like to turn it back to mr devan ard for any additional or closing remarks devan ard president and chief executive officer well yes i don t have any bank or financial related closing remarks but i do want to remind everybody that nashville is hosting the nfl draft this weekend and if you want to see the best and hopefully not the worst of nashville just tune in to espn and you ll get a good flavor of what s going on in nashville and i want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning and look forward to catching up with you again in the third quarter operator duration 38 minutes call participants devan ard president and chief executive officer dan dellinger chief financial officer joe fenech hovde group analyst

the presentation over to devan ard reliant bancorp s president and ceo please go ahead sir devan ard president and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks operator good morning and thanks for joining us on this morning s call to review our results for the first quarter of 2019 we appreciate your continued interest in our company s progress loan growth was exceptionally strong in a quarter that is normally slower due to seasonality loans increased 2 5 during the quarter our 15th consecutive quarter of loan growth and a reflection of nashville s ongoing economic expansion we re especially proud that our loan growth represents 100 core high quality loans at attractive yields and that we don t rely on purchased credits to generate growth total loans grew 14 2 to a record 1 26 billion compared with the first quarter of last year loan production remained strong in the first quarter at 116 2 million up 11 6 compared to the fourth quarter more from the motley fool advertisement advertisement we experienced loan growth across our markets including solid contributions from our new offices in murfreesboro and chattanooga our murfreesboro office opened late in the third quarter and our chattanooga office opened midway through the fourth quarter of last year we re continuing to benefit from a strong and diverse pipeline for new loans entering the second quarter first quarter net income attributable to common shareholders rose slightly to 3 8 million or 0 33 per diluted share compared with the first quarter of last year and down from the fourth quarter of 2018 due mainly to a decline in net interest income because of two fewer days in the quarter compression of our net interest margin in the first quarter and the recognition of a significant tax credit received on a loan originated during the fourth quarter 2018 when the noise from purchase accounting accretion and tax credits is stripped away our core net interest margin remained stable at 3 47 down only 1 basis point from the full year 2018 improvement in core loan yields partially offset our increase in funding cost dan will provide more color later in the call but we shifted our funding mix away from higher cost borrowings to deposits which is why you saw an outsized growth in both balances and costs in our deposit portfolio non interest expenses were up slightly in the quarter as we continue to ramp our new locations in murfreesboro and chattanooga hire revenue producing bankers and invest in the technology we need to serve our customers we expect to generate operating leverage and improved efficiencies as we realize the benefits of these investments as i ve noted in previous quarters the middle tennessee economy remains strong we have branches in seven counties with nashville davidson county at the core and we re well positioned to capture our share of the robust growth in our markets without reducing our focus on quality credits job growth most of which is higher paying white collar jobs continues to drive our economy and despite in migration of about 80 new residents per day the unemployment level is one of the lowest in the country the flourishing tourist industry is fueling significant growth in the hospitality business evidenced by many new hotels in the area revenue per available room and occupancy rates remain very strong supporting the additional capacity we re keenly aware of the boom and bust cycles in the economy so we continue to manage our loan portfolio and new loan production with solid underwriting and risk management practices advertisement advertisement our focus remains on lending to established home builders real estate developers and small to mid sized business customers we maintained our superior credit profile and do not have any loan loss provision or net charge offs in the quarter and criticized and classified loans fell to a cycle low we remain very positive about our company s future loan demand is strong the economy across our markets remains vibrant and growing and we believe that reliant has additional opportunities to grow organically and through potential acquisitions within our footprint m a is a core competency of our franchise and while i have nothing to report at this time m a will remain a key tenet of our strategic plan i ll now turn the call over to dan dellinger our cfo to review our first quarter results in more detail dan dellinger chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks devan and good morning reliant s first quarter balance sheet demonstrates the progress we ve made in growing loans and deposits over the past year total assets were up 9 3 to 1 8 billion since the first quarter of last year with net loans rising 14 2 to 1 3 billion year over year deposits were up 12 to 1 5 billion year over year as devan mentioned the addition of the new offices in murfreesboro and chattanooga have made a strong contribution to these results with especially good loan growth from our chattanooga location which increased loans by 20 6 million during the first quarter of 2019 new loan originations during the first quarter were a strong 116 million with a 5 62 weighted average rate loans generated in the first quarter were distributed across major segments that included 32 for c i loans 31 for cld loans and 16 for cre loans over the past year we ve put more focus on generating c i loans and this quarter s results highlight our progress in this area many of these new loans are not fully funded at the origination date so they represent future loan growth and interest income as deposits are built out and the loans are funded at march 31 our top 10 closed end construction loans had 39 million left to fund deposits set a new record in the first quarter and were up 12 over the first quarter of last year and up 5 1 from the fourth quarter or a 20 4 annualized growth rate we had solid growth in demand deposits up 7 4 annualized from the fourth quarter our revised incentive plans place a higher priority on core deposit growth time deposits were up 22 4 since the first quarter of last year and up 12 4 since the fourth quarter as devan mentioned seeing an opportunity to reduce our overall cost of funding we grew our time deposits and repaid some of our higher costing federal home loan bank advances this strategy resulted in a reduction of 20 basis points in our funding cost advertisement advertisement we expect the time deposit growth going forward will be more tied tied more closely with loan growth the state the result of our improved loan yields and shift in funding mix was a relatively stable core net interest margin our gaap reported margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 3 63 down 19 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2018 stripping out the impacts of purchase accounting accretion which declined 4 basis points for the quarter and tax credits which declined 19 basis points quarter over quarter the core net interest margin for the first quarter of 2019 was 3 47 which is down only 1 basis point from the fourth quarter of 2018 remember again that we recognized the full 2018 tax credit benefit of 500 000 from the community development loan originated in december of 2018 year over year net interest margin was down 16 basis points on a gaap basis and 18 basis points on an adjusted basis primarily due to a 58 basis point year over year increase in cost of funds offset by a 32 basis point year over year increase in loan yield our forecast for net interest margin in the second quarter reflects continued improvements in loan yields on originations and the benefit from increased yields on loans originated in recent quarters as devan noted we expect funding cost to stabilize devan also mentioned our continued emphasis on loan quality and that is reflected in our exit credit quality metrics no provision for loan losses was required during this quarter due to a net recovery of 462 000 generating a 2 basis point increase in our reserve total non performing loans were down 20 to 5 1 million compared with 6 4 million in the first quarter of last year total non performing assets were down almost 24 to 6 1 million from the first quarter of 2018 non performing loans to total loans declined 17 basis points to 0 41 in the first quarter of 2019 we also had net recoveries of 462 000 in the first quarter compared with net charge offs of 138 000 in the fourth first quarter of 2018 criticized assets declined 35 or 6 2 million from the first quarter of last year with most of the decline coming at no loss to the bank at the end of the first quarter we had one property in other real estate which is under contract for sale advertisement advertisement our allowance for loan loss has increased over the past year from 0 88 of total loans at march 31 2018 to 0 9 at march 31 2019 when the unadvertised discount on purchased loans is included our total reserve at march 31 2019 is 1 23 of total loans our credit team remains focused on high quality loans while aggressively pursuing loans that demonstrate early weaknesses at the end of the first quarter of 2019 38 of our loan portfolio carried adjustable interest rates flat with the fourth quarter of 2018 new loan production was more focused on variable rates with 66 of the first quarter s production carrying an adjustable rate competition for high quality commercial loans continues to be fierce in our markets construction loans normally float with time and remain very profitable for us in the fourth in the first quarter 29 of our loan portfolio or 34 million was construction related the outstanding balance of our book of construction loans was 169 million with 102 million remaining to be dispersed non interest income in our retail banking segment was flat with the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018 after removing the impact of the securities gains realized during the first quarter of 2019 efforts to improve the retail banking segment s non interest income continues and although we have experienced some nice improvements in service charges and fees as a result of the community first merger these gains were somewhat offset by a decline in brokerage income year over year non interest expenses for the retail banking segment excluding merger expenses were up 1 6 from the fourth quarter of 2018 and 10 5 year over year the increase in retail non interest expense has been proportionate to asset growth running at 2 2 of assets in the first quarter of 2018 and 2 3 of assets for both the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 the year over year dollar increase was due largely to higher expenses associated with new branches in murfreesboro and chattanooga and investments made to add revenue producing employees and improve technological capabilities our fte year over year remains the same as we continue to hire revenue producing employees in both new and existing markets and staff our new branches advertisement advertisement we were able to reduce headcount by 17 fte from the day the community first deal closed our tax expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased excuse me decreased to 372 000 compared to 797 000 in the first quarter of last year and a credit of 59 000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 going forward in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be around 14 for purposes of our gaap financial statements the mortgage operation s revenue and expenses are combined with the bank and the holding company then netted out as non controlling interest of a subsidiary in the first quarter of 2019 the mortgage subsidiary generated a net loss of 1 5 million compared with a net loss of 1 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net loss of 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 as a reminder our joint venture partner is solely responsible for funding losses in the mortgage operation gains on mortgage loans sold are 56 4 or up 56 4 from the fourth quarter of 2018 and were down 67 1 compared with the first quarter of 2018 i ll wrap with few comments about our strong capital position reliant s total stockholders equity raised to 215 1 million at the end of the first quarter our capital ratios continue to be very strong with our tier 1 leverage ratio at 9 99 and our total risk based capital at 12 92 as both bank and holding company continue to meet the definition of well capitalized financial institutions finally tangible book value per share grew 0 63 at an annualized rate of 18 6 to 14 21 as of march 31 2019 and tangible capital grew at an annualized rate of 17 7 to 164 million we re returning a portion of these gains to our shareholders via quarterly dividends and our stock buyback program now i d like to turn the call back over to devan advertisement advertisement devan ard president and chief executive officer thanks dan before i open the call for questions i want to highlight our strategy for growth including m a opportunities focused on loan quality and our outlook for 2019 last quarter i highlighted our updated strategic plan that focuses on growing reliant bank by developing our existing markets to enhance our organic growth potential our new banking centers in murfreesboro and chattanooga were part of this plan and were strong contributors to our first quarter s growth in loans and deposits we re also ramping up our digital channels and making investments in new technology products and services that we expect to increase our wallet and market share we ve also revised our incentive plans to promote core deposit generation this contributed to our growth in demand deposits over the past quarter and will continue to be a focus of our bankers in the future we re evaluating m a opportunities on a regular basis a core competency of our team our ideal partner institution would have assets exceeding 500 million have a stable core deposit base not be a significant drag on our current growth targets and the transaction would be immediately accretive to earnings we would of course consider smaller opportunities as they arise particularly in counties contiguous to nashville and chattanooga there are several good candidates in the markets we serve dan highlighted the progress that we made over the past year in improving asset quality credit quality remains a key factor in our long term strategy and we re committed to maintaining our high credit standards as i stated last quarter we passed on potential loans that did not meet our underwriting standards and have increased our due diligence for many potential credits evaluating not only the credit quality of the deal but the overall market for new projects that are coming online that might impact on the borrower in the future our credit team is led by alan mims who s on the call with us today and will be available to answer your questions and finally late last year our board authorized repurchasing up to 12 million of our shares and we re consistently in the market buying shares back as we move into the second quarter of the year we remain optimistic about loan demand based on our existing pipeline and the sound economic fundamentals in our markets the unemployment rate is low business confidence remains high and our markets continue to generate new jobs at a healthy pace based on our current outlook we expect continued organic growth in 2019 operator that completes my remarks for this morning s call and we ll now open the call for questions questions and answers operator and we ll take our first question today from joe fenech with hovde group please go ahead joe fenech hovde group analyst good morning guys devan ard president and chief executive officer good morning joe joe fenech hovde group analyst devan you have some nice breathing room now it looks like with respect to the loan to deposit ratio i mean you were in good shape before but now even more so down sub 84 just kind of given that and the strength of the market do we maybe see loan growth pick up a little bit here or and just if you can comment on that that d be helpful devan ard president and chief executive officer sure joe we ve kind been growing loans in that 10 to 14 range now for several years and even though we ve got some room for some additional loan growth i think we probably expect to see that low kind of single digit i mean excuse me low double digit range for loan growth for the rest of the year so somewhere in the 10 to 14 range is where we re comfortable right now joe fenech hovde group analyst ok and you have mentioned some the stabilization expect stabilization in funding cost do you mean that as soon as this quarter we ll maybe see funding costs flatten out a bit or are you saying more sort of a gradual decline in the pace of increase in funding cost and then eventually kind of flattening out over the course of the year devan ard president and chief executive officer yes no i think you re going to see it flatten out in the second quarter joe we ve already kind of seen just through the first 24 25 days of this month a flattening out of our deposit cost probably started in march and i don t think you re going to see much if any increase in our deposit cost in the second quarter versus the first quarter we think they ll be stable for the balance of the year unless the fed does something that we don t really see right now joe fenech hovde group analyst so given that comment and maybe the benefit of the nine rate hikes still cycling through on the earning asset side in terms of a benefit and then balance that against maybe some accretion fall off from prior deals it sounds like in terms of reported nim could reported nim go up from here or do you sort of see reported nim and core nim kind of converging with maybe some increase in core nim along the way devan ard president and chief executive officer i think we ll probably see a fairly stable core nim going forward joe there s certainly a possibility since we ve got a lot of loan production that hasn t actually hit the books in terms of fundings yet at yields that are higher than our loan yield right now we may see a slight expansion but we re kind of modeling a nim for the balance of the year that s pretty much in line with what we saw in the first quarter joe fenech hovde group analyst ok and then within that you had some good wins go ahead sorry dan dellinger chief financial officer i m sorry joe i was just going to elaborate for a minute on the margin demand we stated that the core margin would remain relatively stable we will continue to have the tax credits for about 300 000 per quarter and the purchase accounting adjustments will continue at about the same rate that they are right now although they may decline or although they will decline somewhat over the next three quarters joe fenech hovde group analyst ok that s helpful dan thanks and then devan you had some good real good linked quarter deposit growth if you would to kind of ballpark it in terms of percentage that s the drivers of that is it primarily the new offices or is it spread nicely across the footprint i mean how would you characterize the drivers of that linked quarter deposit growth devan ard president and chief executive officer yes it s spread around the footprint joe i mean we re still seeing a lot of competition for deposits as i m sure you re aware in our market but we did have i d say kind of some outsized growth in chattanooga chattanooga has been a has just been a strong generator both of loans and core deposits for us since we opened our full service office down there but if you kind of look around our system in all of our counties economic growth is continuing and so we ve seen growth in all of our markets i do think the increased focus on especially non interest bearing and other low cost relationship deposits in our incentive plans is starting to pay off and we ll continue to build on that as we get through the year we ve got a campaign that we re going to kick off in the second quarter that is kind of targeted to our best most valued customers we re identifying who those are where they are and our plan is to generate either through referrals from our good our most valued customers or just from additional business from them significant growth in core deposits over the next three quarters we ve done that in the past and it was very successful so we ll kind of roll that out around the company this quarter joe fenech hovde group analyst ok and then last one for me on m a devan it seems like a common theme this quarter in terms of the lack of pickup in m a seems to be smaller banks not having adjusted expectations with sort of the market corrections in december and march what have you is that would you say that s also the case in and around the markets you operate in is there sort of a little bit of irrationality on the part of some of these smaller targets devan ard president and chief executive officer yes joe i mean especially with the private banks there s still some of that out there i think we ve been through a couple of quarters now though where these potential partners they kind of know what s going on in the market they understand long term value so i don t know that it s as pervasive as it was a couple of quarters ago we have as we talked about before i mean we ve had an opportunity to get involved in in the last 12 months four different deals and i don t know that pricing was as big an issue as maybe our disciplined approach to m a and we re just not going to do something that doesn t meet our criteria we re not going to make any offers without some fairly good level of due diligence and they ve got to meet the kind of the guidelines that we have out there so i m not going to price a deal that doesn t make sense for our shareholders and for our employees and our customers and i think in the last few quarters that s really been a bigger issue for us than just seller expectations joe fenech hovde group analyst understood all right thank you devan devan ard president and chief executive officer sure operator and our next question will come from stephen scouten with sandler o neill please go ahead devan ard president and chief executive officer good morning stephen unknown speaker hey guys this is actually peter on for stephen devan ard president and chief executive officer hi peter dan dellinger chief financial officer hi peter glad you are able to get on unknown speaker yeah appreciate all the color you guys have given around the nim and deposit costs could you maybe give us a little bit of color on the c i growth this quarter i think that was a bit surprising relative to the last couple of quarters we ve seen more focus on construction can you break out kind of what were the drivers there devan ard president and chief executive officer sure i m going to let alan mims talk about that peter alan mims chief credit officer we ve continued to have more focus trying to diversify the portfolio in some way we picked up a new lender in our out of our chattanooga office kind of late in the quarter he moved a few of his commercial deals over that were about 4 million toward the end of the quarter we also have one other fairly large commercial deal that we booked about mid quarter it s about 5 5 million so those we try to focus on finding those so that we can diversify a good bit and i think with the pickup of the lender in chattanooga he s primarily a commercial lender rather than commercial real estate so i think we ll see some continued diversity coming out of that with his pickup and we continue to look for those and when they come in we aggressively try to book those deals when we can underwrite them and they re appropriate for our risk profile unknown speaker ok that s great and you guys kind of mentioned the continued build out in the new offices can you give us a little bit of color on the hirings you made there and if you expect any additional hirings here in the near term maybe throughout the remainder of 2019 devan ard president and chief executive officer sure and that s not specifically focused on our new offices peter i mean we are consistently recruiting lenders in all of our markets and so if you get look back over the last 12 months we not only brought in a new lender in murfreesboro and one in chattanooga but we added some here in the middle tennessee area as well and the nashville williamson county area so we ll continue to do that we have we kind of targeted two to three new lenders a year we ve got prospects basically out there in all of our markets and where we can pick up somebody who we re comfortable can come on and be immediately productive and that s really key for us we ll bring them in and any market so kind of the real growth markets for us right now would be sumner county davidson county williamson county rutherford county and then down in chattanooga and where we have opportunities to pick up additional talent in those markets we ll certainly do that unknown speaker great thanks so much operator and we will now go to stuart lotz with kbw please go ahead stuart lotz kbw analyst hey guys good morning dan dellinger chief financial officer good morning devan ard president and chief executive officer hi stuart stuart lotz kbw analyst i guess dan one follow up here with i guess with deposit growth a lot of the growth this quarter was from i guess the cds from the state of tennessee what were those brought on at i saw that i think wholesale cds were up about 20 bps linked quarter just curious from a modeling standpoint alan mims chief credit officer yes they were brought on at about 2 25 for the most part on an average basis we try to keep those relatively short but obviously with the increase that we were beginning to see with the federal home loan bank advance rates it made a lot of sense as i mentioned in the script we saved about 20 basis points so that would have put us at about 2 45 or so with the federal home loan bank advances devan ard president and chief executive officer stuart the good news about the state of tennessee and we ve talked about this on other calls that they ve gotten a good bit more efficient in their pricing so over the last quarter we ve actually seen the rates that we re getting from the state of tennessee decline and as we got cds with them that roll over we ve got an opportunity to price those at a little bit lower level stuart lotz kbw analyst appreciate the color there and i guess going forward is that a strategy or how big is that book currently dan dellinger chief financial officer it is right at 300 million 300 million talking about the state of tennessee stuart lotz kbw analyst yes dan dellinger chief financial officer yes 300 million stuart lotz kbw analyst ok got it and i guess one just one more question back to the margin looks like core loan yields moved about 6 basis points higher this quarter and your earlier comments were that you still had some higher priced loans coming on the book that haven t been funded yet and so i was just curious what your outlook for core loans core loan yields is next quarter and the remainder of this year even with a flat curve and it sounds like obviously deposit pricing you expect to pull back a little bit so is it i guess another way to ask it is is there maybe more upside for the core margin from here devan ard president and chief executive officer i think it s certainly possible we re not modeling a big upside right now stuart there are two components in the unfunded portion the production in the first quarter is one where we did 116 million at a weighted average yield of a little bit north of 5 60 so yes you can compare that and that didn t all fund in the first quarter but you can compare that to what our portfolio yield was and then we we also at the end of the quarter we had about 40 million in unfunded closed end construction loans that some of those were originated several quarters ago and they re funding up over time those rates are not all at the 5 62 level i mean some of those were closed say a year ago and they re still in the 5 or sub 5 area but to the extent we ve got floating rate loans out there that are construction related they re all tied to prime and you see those move up as prime moves up so that s kind of a long winded way of saying yes i do think there s a possibility that we could see an expansion in our portfolio yield what we experienced in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter probably not unreasonable to see another 4 or 5 basis points in the second quarter alan mims chief credit officer i can expand on that a little bit too fourth quarter our coupon rates were about 4 85 on average first quarter of 2019 they were 4 95 it s up about 10 basis points quarter over quarter obviously in the fourth quarter we had a lot of noise as it related to the tax credits which represented about 29 basis points which pushed overall yields up to about 5 53 on the portfolio moving forward those are going to be at about 10 basis points which is what we had estimated before and also the purchase accounting is probably going to be around the 10 or 11 10 to 11 basis point range stuart lotz kbw analyst got it thanks and i guess just circling back one more on capital devan i know you mentioned the buyback how active have you been so far i saw that i guess in the period shares were down about 25 000 but just thoughts there and what we can expect over the next few quarters if an m a transaction doesn t come to fruition devan ard president and chief executive officer sure sure i don t know that an m a transaction would have a lot of impact on it the authorized amount was 12 million through the end of the quarter we had repurchased around 35 000 shares we think at the current price level of our stock it s still a good use of our capital so we re continuing to do that we are buying shares every day that we can there are some restrictions on how much you can buy on a daily basis that are related to your average daily volume so can t really get as much as i d like if there was a block available we could certainly take that too but at this point in the cycle we re in there has not been a block a larger block of shares available so we re going to continue to buy back stuart as shares are available unless the stock price spikes and in which case i think we d all be happy with that so stuart lotz kbw analyst got it well thanks for taking my question guys and congrats on a nice quarter alan mims chief credit officer thanks like it operator and it appears there are no further questions so i d like to turn it back to mr devan ard for any additional or closing remarks devan ard president and chief executive officer well yes i don t have any bank or financial related closing remarks but i do want to remind everybody that nashville is hosting the nfl draft this weekend and if you want to see the best and hopefully not the worst of nashville just tune in to espn and you ll get a good flavor of what s going on in nashville and i want to thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning and look forward to catching up

paying taxes is no fun and with tax season just having ended there are millions of people who just sent more money to the irs than they really wanted to pay if you ve just written a big check to the federal government you might be curious about where your hard earned money will go each year the federal government gives the general public an idea of how it spends the tax revenue it brings in with spending coming up to just shy of 4 trillion in the most recent year for which government data is available the money that you and millions just sent to the treasury go toward meeting a large number of different purposes u s capitol building as seen from just left of center image source getty images the math of government budgets in the federal government s 2017 fiscal year the total amount collected in taxes amounted to 3 32 trillion that was well shy of the 3 98 trillion that the government spent that year leaving the treasury to borrow money to come up with the 665 billion difference the biggest share of that money came from individual taxpayers with 40 coming from personal income taxes and another 29 coming from the social security medicare unemployment and other taxes that are typically collected through payroll withholding borrowing to cover the deficit amounted to 17 of total spending advertisement advertisement as you can see below the government spent that money primarily in three key areas with five out of every six dollars falling into these categories pie graph showing federal government spending image source internal revenue service the biggest category is social security medicare and other retirement programs the federal government provides these programs to help give income support to retired workers and the disabled as well as offering medical care primarily to the elderly with more than 60 million people receiving social security and nearly all of those 65 or older qualifying to receive medicare coverage it comes as no surprise that the federal government spends two fifths of its budget supporting these programs advertisement advertisement social programs represent the second largest category of federal government spending the best known programs that fall under this category are the medicaid program for providing healthcare for low income americans and the supplemental nutrition assistance program that allows those with few financial resources to obtain money for buying food the supplemental security income program administered by the social security administration also falls under this category because of its need based guidelines and other similar programs provide temporary financial assistance to needy families and meet other social needs a small portion of this money goes toward health research and public health programs along with providing assisted housing unemployment compensation and other social services finally the third biggest expenditure goes to national defense this includes not only the money needed to pay military salaries and buy or upgrade military equipment but also funding for veterans benefits and services in addition military and economic assistance to foreign countries also falls into this category along with the expense of maintaining overseas embassies the remaining 16 or so of the budget gets divvied up across a wider range of programs about half goes to areas like agriculture natural resources environment transportation education job training science bank insurance commerce and housing credits and community development activities interest on the national debt requires 6 of total expenditures leaving 2 for general government needs future challenges ahead what s particularly concerning is that there s reason to believe that the stress on the federal budget will become even more pronounced in future years a host of factors will contribute to that trend advertisement advertisement the retirement of the baby boomer generation will lead to increased benefit payments for social security and medicare that could drain their respective trust funds higher interest rates could lead to a big increase in the amount of money needed to pay interest on the national debt healthcare expenses have risen at a faster pace than overall inflation for years and if that trend continues it ll put medicare and medicaid into further difficulty as a taxpayer you don t have any direct say in how the federal government spends the taxes you pay but the more you know about government expenditures the easier it ll be to use your rights as an american to seek out tax policies that make sense for you and the public at large more from the motley fool the motley fool has a disclosure policy
the human predicament is driven by overpopulation overconsumption of natural resources and the use of unnecessarily environmentally damaging technologies and socio economic political arrangements to service homo sapiens aggregate consumption declared notorious doomster paul ehrlich and his biologist wife anne ehrlich in the march 2013 proceedings of the royal society b they additionally warned another possible threat to the continuation of civilization is global toxification which has expos the human population to myriad subtle poisons in 1968 ehrlich infamously prophesied in the population bomb the battle to feed all of humanity is over in the 1970s the world will undergo famines hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now ehrlich was wrong then and he and his wife are wrong now the world is not going to be overpopulated run out of resources or see the outbreak of massive cancer epidemics due to exposures to synthetic chemicals let s take a close look at five threats that failed to materialize despite the warnings of 20th century doomsayers the cancer epidemic in 2007 an american cancer society poll found that 7 out of 10 americans believed that the risk of dying of cancer is going up and no wonder with authorities such as the prestigious president s cancer panel ominously reporting that with nearly 80 000 chemicals on the market in the united states many of which are used by millions of americans in their daily lives and are un or understudied and largely unregulated exposure to potential environmental carcinogens is widespread one member of that panel howard university surgeon dr lasalle d leffall jr went so far as to declare in 2010 that the increasing number of known or suspected environmental carcinogens compels us to action even though we may currently lack irrefutable proof of harm there s just one problem with the panic there is no growing cancer epidemic even as the number of man made chemicals has proliferated your chances of dying of the disease have been dropping for more than four decades and not only have cancer death rates been declining significantly age adjusted cancer incidence rates have been falling for nearly two decades that is of the number of americans in nearly any age group fewer are actually coming down with cancer what s more modern medicine has increased the five year survival rates of cancer patients from 50 percent in the 1970s to 68 percent today in fact the overall incidence of cancer has been falling about 0 6 percent per year since 1994 that may not sound like much but as dr john seffrin ceo of the american cancer society explains because the rate continues to drop it means that in recent years about 100 000 people each year who would have died had cancer rates not declined are living to celebrate another birthday what s going on according to the centers for disease control and prevention age adjusted cancer incidence rates have been dropping largely because fewer americans are smoking more are having colonoscopies in which polyps that might become cancerous are removed and in the early 2000s many women stopped hormone replacement therapy which moderately increases the risk of breast cancer how did it come to be the conventional wisdom that man made chemicals are especially toxic and the chief sources of a modern cancer epidemic it all began with rachel carson the author of the 1962 book silent spring in silent spring carson crafted an ardent denunciation of modern technology hostility to which drives environmentalist ideology to this day at its heart is this belief nature is beneficent stable and even a source of moral good humanity is arrogant heedless and often the source of moral evil carson more than any other person is responsible for the politicization of science that afflicts our contemporary public policy debates rachel carson surely must have known that cancer is a disease in which the risk goes up as people age and thanks to vaccines and new antibiotics americans in the 1950s were living much longer long enough to get and die of cancer in 1900 average life expectancy was 47 and the annual death rate was 1 700 out of 100 000 americans by 1960 life expectancy had risen to nearly 70 years and the annual death rate had fallen to 950 per 100 000 people currently life expectancy is more than 78 years and the annual death rate is 790 per 100 000 people today although only about 13 percent of americans are over age 65 they account for 53 percent of new cancer diagnoses and 69 percent of cancer deaths carson realized that even if people didn t worry much about their own health as they aged they did really care about that of their kids so to ratchet up the fear factor she asserted that children were especially vulnerable to the carcinogenic effects of synthetic chemicals the situation with respect to children is even more deeply disturbing she wrote a quarter century ago cancer in children was considered a medical rarity today more american school children die of cancer than from any other disease in support of this claim she reported that twelve per cent of all deaths in children between the ages of one and fourteen are caused by cancer although it sounds alarming carson s statistic is essentially meaningless out of context which she failed to supply it turns out that the percentage of children dying of cancer was rising because other causes of death such as infectious diseases were drastically declining the american cancer society reports that about 10 450 children in the united states will be diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and that childhood cancers make up less than 1 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year childhood cancer incidence has been rising slowly over the past couple of decades at a rate of 0 6 percent per year consequently the incidence rate increased from 13 per 100 000 in the 1970s to 16 per 100 000 now there is no known cause for this increase the good news is that 80 percent of kids with cancer now survive five years or more up from 50 percent in the 1970s so did the predicted cancer doom ever arrive no remember overall incidence rates are down with regard to cancer risks posed by synthetic chemicals the american cancer society in its 2014 cancer facts and figures report concludes exposure to carcinogenic agents in occupational community and other settings is thought to account for a relatively small percentage of cancer deaths about 4 percent from occupational exposures and 2 percent from environmental pollutants man made and naturally occurring similarly the british organization cancer research uk observes that for most people harmful chemicals and pollution pose a very minor risk how minor cancer research uk notes large organizations like the world health organization and the international agency for research into cancer have estimated that pollution and chemicals in our environment only account for about 3 percent of all cancers most of these cases are in people who work in certain industries and are exposed to high levels of chemicals in their jobs like the american cancer society cancer research uk advises lifestyle factors such as smoking alcohol obesity unhealthy diets inactivity and heavy sun exposure account for a much larger proportion of cancers overpopulation to ecologists who study animals food and population often seem like sides of the same coin wrote paul and anne ehrlich in 1990 if too many animals are devouring it the food supply declines too little food the supply of animals declines and then the kicker homo sapiens is no exception to that rule the ehrlichs predicted that if the global climate system remained stable it might take three decades or more for the food production system to come apart unless its repair became a top priority of all humanity they added one thing seems safe to predict starvation and epidemic disease will raise death rates over most of the planet it s 25 years later and instead of going up the global crude death rate has dropped from 9 7 per 1 000 people in 1990 to 7 9 now more than two decades later despite a distinct lack of apocalypses in the intervening time the couple was still singing the same tune for example during a may 2013 conference at the university of vermont paul ehrlich asked what are the chances a collapse of civilization can be avoided his answer 10 percent did the ehrlichs just get the timing wrong is the threat of overpopulation still looming over us in september 2014 demographers working with the united nations population division published an article in science arguing that world population would grow to around 11 billion by 2100 nearly all of that increase 4 billion people was projected in sub saharan africa but wolfgang lutz and his fellow demographers at the international institute for applied systems analysis beg to differ in their november 2014 study world population and human capital in the twenty first century lutz and his colleagues take into account the fact that the education levels of women are rising fast around the world including in africa in most societies particularly during the process of demographic transition women with more education have fewer children both because they want fewer and because they find better ways to pursue their goals they note given current age sex and education trends they estimate that world population will most likely peak at 9 6 billion by 2070 and then begin falling if the boosting of education levels is pursued more aggressively world population could instead top out at 8 9 billion in 2060 before starting to drop falling fertility rates are overdetermined that is there is a plethora of mutually reinforcing data and hypotheses that explain the global downward trend these include the effects of increased economic opportunities more education longer lives greater liberty and expanding globalization and trade the crucial point is that all of these explanations reinforce one another and accelerate the trend of falling global fertility even more interestingly they all emphasize how the opportunities afforded women by modernity produce lower fertility insight into how the life prospects of women shape reproductive outcomes is provided in a 2010 article in human nature examining the relationship between life expectancy reproduction and educational attainment in that study university of connecticut anthropologists nicola bulled and richard sosis divvied up 193 countries into five groups by their average life expectancies in countries where women could expect to live to between 40 and 50 years they bear an average of 5 5 children those with life expectancies between 51 and 61 average 4 8 children the big drop in fertility occurs at that point bulled and sosis found that when women s life expectancy rises to between 61 and 71 years her total fertility drops to 2 5 children between 71 and 75 years it s 2 2 children and over 75 years women average 1 7 children the united nations 2012 revision notes that global average life expectancy at birth rose from 47 years in 1955 to 70 years in 2010 these findings suggest that it is more than just coincidence that the average global fertility rate has fallen over that time period from 5 to 2 45 children today in any case it is a mistake to decry people as just consumers of resources with the advent of democratic capitalism they are also creators of new technologies services and ideas that have over the past two centuries enabled billions to rise from humanity s natural state of abject poverty and pervasive ignorance killer tomatoes given the well established advantages of modern biotech crops including such benefits to the natural environment as lessening pesticide use preventing soil erosion tolerating drought and boosting yields why do many leading environmentalist groups so strenuously oppose them much of that answer is historically contingent just as biotech crops were being commercialized in the 1990s they ran into a perfect storm of food and safety scandals in europe in order to protect beef farmers and suppliers british food safety authorities downplayed the dangers of mad cow disease which was spread by feeding cattle infected sheep s brains the agency in charge of french public health permitted human transfusions of hiv contaminated blood despite the existence of screening technology and the asbestos industry was revealed to have exercised undue influence over its regulators in evaluating the risks posed by that toxic mineral these incidents of fecklessness led to strong distrust and caused people to think that firms and public authorities sometimes disregard certain health risks in order to protect certain economic or political interests argues french national institute of agricultural research analyst sylvie bonny consequently the events increased the public s attention to critical voices and so the principle of precaution became an omnipresent reference so when biotech crops were being introduced much of the european public was primed to take seriously any claims that this new technology might carry hidden risks bonny points out that opposition to biotech crops arose first among ecologist associations including greenpeace and friends of the earth in fact hyping opposition to biotech crops served as a lifeline to these organizations bonny notes that in the late 1990s greenpeace in france was experiencing a serious falloff in membership and donations but the genetically modified organism gmo issue rescued the group its anti gmo action was instrumental in strengthening greenpeace france which had been in serious financial straits she reports it should always be borne in mind that environmentalist organizations raise money to support themselves by scaring people more generally bonny observes for some people especially many activists biotechnology also symbolizes the negative aspects of globalization and economic liberalism she adds since the collapse of the communist ideal has made direct opposition to capitalism more difficult today it seems to have found new forms of expression including in particular criticism of globalization certain aspects of consumption technical developments etc these concerns obviously go well beyond any scientific considerations regarding the safety of biotech crops for health and the environment and have had significant negative consequences for the acceptance of this useful technology around the world especially in poor countries no one has ever gotten so much as a cough sneeze sniffle or stomachache from eating foods made with ingredients from modern biotech crops every independent scientific body that has ever evaluated the safety of biotech crops has found them to be safe for humans to eat we have reviewed the scientific literature on crop safety for the last 10 years that catches the scientific consensus that has matured since ge plants became widely cultivated worldwide and we can conclude that the scientific research conducted so far has not detected any significant hazard directly connected with the use of gm crops asserted a team of italian university researchers in september 2013 and they should know since they conducted the largest ever survey of scientific studies more than 1 700 that evaluated the safety of such crops a statement issued by the board of directors of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the largest scientific organization in the united states on october 20 2012 point blank asserted that contrary to popular misconceptions gm crops are the most extensively tested crops ever added to our food supply there are occasional claims that feeding gm foods to animals causes aberrations ranging from digestive disorders to sterility tumors and premature death although such claims are often sensationalized and receive a great deal of media attention none have stood up to rigorous scientific scrutiny the aaas board concluded indeed the science is quite clear crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe in july 2012 the european commission s chief scientific adviser anne glover declared there is no substantiated case of any adverse impact on human health animal health or environmental health so that s pretty robust evidence and i would be confident in saying that there is no more risk in eating gmo food than eating conventionally farmed food at its annual meeting in june 2012 the american medical association endorsed a report arguing against the labeling of bioengineered foods from its council on science and public health the report concluded bioengineered foods have been consumed for close to 20 years and during that time no overt consequences on human health have been reported and or substantiated in the peer reviewed literature in december 2010 a european commission review of 130 e u funded biotechnology research projects covering a period of more than 25 years and involving more than 500 independent research groups found no scientific evidence associating gmos with higher risks for the environment or for food and feed safety than conventional plants and organisms catastrophic climate change let s start by accepting that global warming is real there are two ways to address concerns about climate change adaptation and mitigation in 2014 the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc issued two reports addressing these options climate change 2014 impacts adaptation and vulnerability hereafter the adaptation report which describes adaptation as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects and climate change 2014 mitigation hereafter the mitigation report which defines mitigation as a human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases the ipcc reports offer cost estimates for both adaptation and mitigation the adaptation report reckons that assuming that the world takes no steps to deal with climate change global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of around 2 c are between 0 2 and 2 0 percent of income the report adds losses are more likely than not to be greater rather than smaller than this range in a 2010 proceedings of the national academy of sciences article yale economist william nordhaus assumed that humanity will do nothing to cut greenhouse gas emissions nordhaus uses an integrated assessment model that combines the scientific and socioeconomic aspects of climate change to assess policy options for climate change control his rice 2010 integrated assessment model found that of the estimated damages in the uncontrolled baseline case those damages in 2095 are 12 trillion or 2 8 of global output for a global temperature increase of 3 4 c above 1900 levels nordhaus estimate evidently assumes that the world s economy will grow at about 2 5 percent annually reaching a total gdp of roughly 450 trillion in 2095 what might the world s economy look like by 2100 using various policies with the aim of mitigating or adapting to climate change in 2012 the ipcc asked the economists in the environment directorate at the organisation for economic co operation and development to peer into the future and devise a plausible set of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps to the year 2100 the oecd economists came up with five baseline scenarios let s take a look at a couple of the scenarios to get some idea of how the world s economy might evolve over the remainder of this century the oecd analysis begins in 2010 with a world population of 6 8 billion and a total world gross product of 67 trillion in 2005 dollars this yields a global per capita income just shy of 10 000 for reference the oecd notes that u s 2010 per capita income averaged 42 000 the ssp2 scenario is described as the middle of the road projection in which trends typical of recent decades continue with some progress towards achieving development goals reductions in resource and energy intensity at historic rates and slowly decreasing fossil fuel dependency if economic and demographic history unfolds as that scenario suggests world population will have peaked at around 9 6 billion in 2065 and fallen to just over 9 billion by 2100 the world s economy will have grown more than eightfold from 67 trillion to 577 trillion 2005 dollars average income per person globally will have increased from around 10 000 today to 60 000 by 2100 u s annual incomes would average just over 100 000 in the ssp5 conventional development scenario the world economy grows flat out which leads to an energy system dominated by fossil fuels resulting in high emissions and challenges to mitigation because there is more urbanization and because there are higher levels of education world population will peak at 8 6 billion in 2055 and will have fallen to 7 4 billion by 2100 the world s economy will grow 15 fold to just over 1 quadrillion and the average person in 2100 will be earning about 138 000 per year u s annual incomes would exceed 187 000 per capita it is of more than passing interest that people living in the warmer world of ssp5 are much better off than people in the cooler ssp2 world the oecd analysis adds with regard to climate change in this scenario that the much richer and more highly educated people in 2100 will face lower socio environmental challenges to adaptation result from attainment of human development goals robust economic growth highly engineered infrastructure with redundancy to minimize disruptions from extreme events and highly managed ecosystems in other words greater wealth and advanced technologies will significantly enhance people s capabilities to deal with whatever the deleterious consequences of climate change turn out to be as noted above the ipcc estimates that failure to adapt to climate change will reduce future incomes by between 0 2 to 2 percent for temperatures exceeding 2 c yale s nordhaus is one of the more accomplished researchers in the area of trying to calculate the costs and benefits of climate change in his 2013 book the climate casino risk uncertainty and economics for a warming world nordhaus notes that a survey of studies that try to estimate the aggregated damages that climate change might inflict at 2 5 c warming comes in at an average of about 1 5 percent of global output the highest climate damage estimate nord haus cites is a 5 percent reduction in income though the much criticized 2006 stern review the economics of climate change suggested that the business as usual path of economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions could reduce future incomes by as much as 20 percent future temperatures will perhaps exceed these but transient climate response temperatures over the remainder of the century are likely to be close to the 2 5 c benchmark cited by the ipcc in the scenarios sketched out above a 2 percent loss of income would mean that the 60 000 and 138 000 per capita income averages would fall to 58 800 and 135 240 respectively stern s more apocalyptic estimate would cut 2100 per capita incomes to 48 000 and 110 400 respectively so how much should people living now on incomes averaging 10 000 per year spend to make sure that people whose incomes will likely be six to 14 times higher aren t reduced by a couple of percentage points as nordhaus observes most philosophers and economists hold that rich generations have a lower ethical claim on resources than poorer generations making the extreme set of assumptions that all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately and adopt a single global carbon price and widely deploy current versions of low and no carbon technologies such as wind solar and nuclear power the ipcc s 2014 mitigation report estimates that keeping carbon dioxide concentrations below 450 parts per million ppm in 2100 would result in an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0 04 to 0 14 percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1 6 percent and 3 percent per year the median estimate in reduced annualized growth in consumption is 0 06 percent the ipcc mitigation report notes that the optimal scenario that it sketches out for keeping greenhouse gas concentrations below 450 ppm would cut incomes in 2100 by between 3 and 11 percent how much would that be as was done with regard to the losses from a lack of adaptation let s look at how much the worst case mitigation scenario might reduce future incomes without extra mitigation the increase of global gross product to 577 trillion in the middle of the road scenario implies an economic growth rate of 2 42 percent between 2010 and 2100 cutting that growth rate by 0 14 percentage points to 2 28 percent yields an income of 510 trillion in 2100 reducing per capita incomes from 60 000 to 57 000 per capita growth in the conventional development scenario is cut from an implied 3 07 percent to 2 93 percent reducing overall income from over 1 015 quadrillion to 901 trillion and cutting average incomes from 138 000 to 122 000 all of these figures must be taken with a vat of salt since they are projections for economic demographic and biophysical events nearly a century from now that being acknowledged projected ipcc income losses that would result from doing nothing to adapt to climate change appear to be roughly comparable to the losses in income that would occur following efforts to slow climate change in other words it appears that doing nothing about climate change now will cost future generations about the same as doing something now if the results of adaptation and mitigation are more or less the same for future generations how to pick which path to follow given what we know about the competence and efficiency of government it seems likely that what governments try to do to mitigate climate change may well turn out to be worse than climate change the better path is one that helps future generations deal with climate change by adopting policies that encourage rapid economic growth this would endow future generations with the wealth and superior technologies necessary to handle whatever comes at them including climate change mass extinction many biologists and conservationists are urgently warning that humanity is on the verge of wiping out hundreds of thousands of species in this century a large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk under projected climate change during and beyond the 21st century states the 2014 ipcc adaptation report current rates of extinction are about 1000 times the likely background rate of extinction asserts a may 2014 review article in science by duke university biologist stuart pimm and his colleagues scientists estimate we re now losing species at 1 000 to 10 000 times the background rate with literally dozens going extinct every day warns the center for biological diversity that group adds it could be a scary future indeed with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid century eminent harvard university biologist e o wilson agrees we re destroying the rest of life in one century we ll be down to half the species of plants and animals by the end of the century if we keep at this rate university of california at berkeley biologist anthony barnosky similarly notes it looks like modern extinction rates resemble mass extinction rates assuming that species loss continues unabated barnosky adds the sixth mass extinction could arrive within as little as three to 22 centuries let s assume 5 million species if wilson is right that half could be gone by the middle of this century that implies that species are disappearing at a rate of 71 000 per year or just under 200 per day contrast this implied extinction rate with pimm and his colleagues who estimate that the background rate of extinction without human influence is about 0 1 species per million species years this means that if one followed the fates of one million species one would expect to observe about one species going extinct every 10 years their new estimate is 100 species going extinct per million species years so if the world contains 5 million species then that suggests that 500 are going extinct every year obviously there is a huge gap between wilson s off the cuff estimate and pimm s more cautious calculations though both assessments are troubling but this is not the first time biologists have sounded the alarm over purportedly accelerated species extinctions in 1970 dr s dillon ripley secretary of the smithsonian institution predicted that in 25 years somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals would be extinct that is as much as four out of every five species of animals would be extinct by 1995 happily that did not happen in 1994 biologist peter raven predicted that since more than nine tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next thirty years or so it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it it s now more than 20 years later and nowhere near 90 percent of the rainforests have been cut down and no one thinks that half of the species inhabiting tropical forests have vanished in 1979 oxford university biologist norman myers suggested in his book the sinking ark that 40 000 species per year were going extinct and that the world could lose a million species or one quarter of all species by the year 2000 at a 1979 symposium at brigham young university thomas lovejoy a former president of the h john heinz iii center for science economics and the environment announced that he had made an estimate of extinctions that will take place between now and the end of the century attempting to be conservative wherever possible i still came up with a reduction of global diversity between one seventh and one fifth lovejoy drew up the first projections of global extinction rates for the global 2000 report to the president in 1980 if lovejoy had been right between 15 and 20 percent of all species alive in 1980 would be extinct right now no one believes that extinctions of this magnitude have occurred over the last three decades what did happen as of 2013 the international union for the conservation of nature iucn lists 709 known species as having gone extinct since 1500 a study published in science in july 2014 reported that among terrestrial vertebrates 322 species have become extinct since 1500 that s not nothing but those assessments amount to just 1 percent of all vertebrate terrestrial species alive today don t panic why does it matter if the population at large believes these dire predictions about humanity s future the primary danger is they may fuel a kind of pathological conservatism that could actually become a self fulfilling prophecy the closest thing to a canonical version of the precautionary principle was devised by a group of 32 leading environmental activists meeting in 1998 at the wingspread center in wisconsin the wingspread consensus statement on the precautionary principle reads when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically in this context the proponent of an activity rather than the public should bear the burden of proof the process of applying the precautionary principle must be open informed and democratic and must include potentially affected parties it must also involve an examination of the full range of alternatives including no action why was this new principle needed because the wingspread conferees asserted the deployment of modern technologies was spawning unintended consequences affecting human health and the environment and existing environmental regulations and other decisions particularly those based on risk assessment have failed to protect adequately human health and the environment as a result of these unintended side effects and the supposed regulatory inadequacy the conferees insisted corporations government entities organizations communities scientists and other individuals must adopt a precautionary approach to all human endeavors emphasis added contemplate for a moment this question are there any human endeavors at all that some timorous person could not assert raise a threat of harm to human health or the environment promoters of the precautionary principle argue that its great advantage is that implementing it will help avoid deleterious unintended consequences of new technologies unfortunately supporters are most often focusing on the seen while ignoring the unseen in his brilliant essay what is seen and what is unseen 19th century french economist frederic bastiat pointed out that the favorable predictable effects of any policy often produce many disastrous later consequences banning nuclear power plants reduces the imagined seen risk of exposure to radiation while boosting the unseen risks associated with man made global warming prohibiting a pesticide aims to diminish the seen risk of cancer but elevates the unseen risk of malaria demanding more drug trials seeks to

attempts to address the seen risks of dependence on foreign oil but heightens the unseen risks of starvation electricity automobiles antibiotics oil production computers plastics vaccinations chlorination mining pesticides paper manufacture and nearly everything that constitutes the vast enterprise of modern technology all have risks on the other hand it should be perfectly obvious that allowing inventors and entrepreneurs to take those risks has enormously lessened others how do we know people in modern societies are enjoying much longer and healthier lives than did our ancestors with greatly reduced risks of disease debility and early death the precautionary principle is the opposite of the scientific process of trial and error that is the modern engine of knowledge and prosperity the precautionary principle impossibly demands trials without errors successes without failures the direct implication of trial without error is obvious if you can do nothing without knowing first how it will turn out you cannot do anything at all explained aaron wildavsky in his 1988 book searching for safety an indirect implication of trial without error is that if trying new things is made more costly there will be fewer departures from past practice this very lack of change may itself be dangerous in forgoing chances to reduce existing hazards wildavsky added existing hazards will continue to cause harm if we fail to reduce them by taking advantage of the opportunity to benefit from repeated trials should we look before we leap sure we should but every utterance of proverbial wisdom has its counterpart reflecting both the complexity and the variety of life s situations and the foolishness involved in applying a short list of hard rules to them given the manifold challenges of poverty and environmental renewal that technological progress can help us address in this century the wiser maxim to heed is he who hesitates is lost
just before christmas last year japan s ailing emperor akihito 85 celebrated his final birthday as head of the world s oldest hereditary monarchy on a note of contentment his voice cracking with emotion akihito said he felt deep comfort when he recalled that his 30 years on the chrysanthemum throne had been free of war that peace was thanks largely to the war renouncing constitution which has kept japan out of foreign entanglements since 1945 but akihito s reign known as the heisei era which officially ends with his abdication at the end of this month had its share of trauma not least has been a steep erosion of national confidence and the fear among many in japan that the country s best years are over heisei began in january 1989 with a hubristic swagger cars and cool electronic gadgets poured out of japan s factories the raw facts of the heisei era seem to reinforce this concern after decades of strong growth japan s economic juggernaut slowed to a crawl particularly between 1997 2012 when it grew just 0 6 per cent a year for a quarter of a century during the post war boom years average annual growth had topped 10 per cent a collapsing asset bubble wiped out a generation of wealth commercial land prices in tokyo and five other major cities plummeted by 87 per cent from their peak public debt spiralled surpassing a quadrillion yen in 2013 or more than twice japan s gross domestic product no fewer than 17 leaders rotated through the doors of the prime minister s office read more reinforcing the sense of national malaise as japan takes stock of the heisei era is the ageing shrinking population in 2017 nearly 400 000 more people died in japan than were born that s certainly not the whole picture and in some ways the story of japan since 2010 is its resilience but heisei began in january 1989 with a hubristic swagger cars and cool electronic gadgets poured out of japan s factories its banks gorged on swelling asset and property prices to rival the world s largest financial institutions as 1989 ended the nikkei stock average hit a record high with america in decline some rashly predicted japan would become the world s greatest economic power britain s prime minister theresa may r is greeted by emperor akihito of japan during her visit to the royal palace photograph carl court getty of course it was not to be the party soured in the early 1990s and stagnation followed in 2010 japan lost its place as the world s second largest economy to china a title it had held since 1968 when it overtook west germany emperor akihito s reign was also studded with natural disasters an earthquake in 1995 killed more than 6 000 people and levelled much of kobe city another in 2011 left 19 000 people dead or missing along the east coast destroyed infrastructure worth 10 per cent of gdp and triggered the world s worst nuclear crisis since chernobyl in 1986 in hindsight these lost decades as they were dubbed obscured japan s underlying strengths throughout unemployment never rose above 6 per cent income was better managed than many western economies america has three times more poor and rich people crime fell to historic lows reconstruction was comfortably financed from japan s deep pool of savings the nation s banks steeled by the bad debt crisis weathered the global financial crash of 2008 9 better than elsewhere and the economy rebounded faster japan has since outperformed its major capitalist rivals in per capita income growth national decline rarely looked this good japan is back the unlikely political cheerleader for japan s late heisei recovery is prime minister shinzo abe who crashed and burned during his first term in office in 2006 2007 he returned in december 2012 with an inspiring message japan is back in one of his first major international speeches the following year abe pledged to turn around the 5 trillion economy keep counting on my country he said japan is not and will never be a tier two country for years japanese governments had seemed content to manage deflation now abe was calling a halt with bold plans for fiscal and monetary reform including a series of large stimulus packages and a vast expansion in the country s money supply that robust interventionism won the support of many who seemed content to turn a blind eye to his political hawkishness and right wing take on japan s past to some this all looked like nostalgia for japan s big power status as he coasts towards november when he will become the longest serving prime minister in japan s history however abe can point to an impressive list of banner figures the economy is enjoying its longest expansion since the end of the second world war unemployment is at a 26 year low japan has net external assets of about 3 trillion making it the world s largest creditor nation its corporations are perched on a mountain of retained earnings us president donald trump with shinzo abe japan s prime minister photograph shizuo kambayashi bloomberg moreover after years as an apparent economic laggard japan looks ahead of the pack a decade before european and american governments experimented with zero interest rates and asset purchases quantitative easing to prevent the unravelling of their economies in 2008 japan was pioneering these techniques other rich countries are also struggling with weak demand rising public debt and ageing workforces and looking to japan a country once considered a basket case for lessons abe s pledges to expand economic growth and return his nation to first tier status are hampered however by its grim demographics government projections say the labour force could collapse by 20 per cent before 2040 a decline notes glen s fukushima a senior fellow at the washington based think tank center for american progress that was predicted as far back as the 1970s not much was done to address it emperor akihito retires with his country in better health then than he might have hoped a decade ago the economy has responded by sucking millions of women and elderly people into the workforce which hit a record last year of nearly 67 million but what will japan do once that finite pool has dried up abe has surprised some with a solution largely shunned for decades immigration this month visa rules will be relaxed to allow in more foreign workers yet the published figures 345 000 workers in the next five years are a drop in the bucket efforts to raise the birthrate meanwhile would require a revolution of employment practices at japan s corporations with their punishing demands on the baby making population in any case conservatives value homogeneity and social harmony too much to embrace the multiculturalism of europe says yoko takeda of mitsubishi research institute a think tank that leaves machines robots and artificial intelligence will be pressed into service by 2030 she predicts japan may even have a labour surplus the reiwa era emperor akihito retires with his country in better health then than he might have hoped a decade ago but the reiwa era under his son naruhito opens on may 1st in a world dramatically reshaped by the rise of china as japan s share of the global economy has shrunk its neighbour s has grown for most of heisei china s gdp expanded by more than 9 per cent a year mirroring japan s miracle years and china gives the impression of preparing for war it now spends more on its military than any other country except the united states with whom its maritime ambitions put it on a collision course japan s response to china s expansion under abe has been to prepare for the worst with a string of record breaking military budgets and a reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution expanding its military role abroad the two countries have threatened to square off over a clump of rocks in the east china sea that japan owns but china claims the abe government s rejection of what his supporters call apology diplomacy for the nation s wartime misdeeds against china in the 1930s and 1940s have complicated what was already a fractious relationship the historic precedents for a peaceful transition are not encouraging most cases of rising and declining powers have ended in conflict indeed it may have been this fear that akihito alluded to in his birthday address moreover as abe prepares to shed the remains of japan s post war pacifism there is little political brake on his ruling liberal democratic party a brief experiment with multi party democracy in 2009 2012 has faded and japan s ageing voters seem little inclined to push for radical change will people look back at heisei nostalgically as the calm before the storm or think of it as an era of lost opportunities or a time of stagnation before new dynamism wonders tessa morris suzuki professor emerita of japanese history at the australian national university it all depends on how reiwa turns out she says japan s government has translated the era s name as beautiful harmony only time will tell if it lives to that billing

information on the ir portion of our website and with that i d like to turn the call over to david david fisher chief executive officer good afternoon everyone thanks for joining our call today i m going to start by giving a brief overview of the first quarter and then i ll update you on our strategy after that i ll turn the call over to steve cunningham our cfo who will discuss our financial results and guidance in more detail we kicked off the year with a strong first quarter top line results were in line with our guidance driven by demand consistent with typical q1 seasonality in the quarter we also experienced good credit performance and very effective and efficient marketing this enabled us to deliver solid profitability that exceeded the top end of our guidance first quarter revenue of 293 million increased 15 over last year primarily driven by growth in our u s businesses and first quarter adjusted ebitda was a record 75 million an increase of 10 over last year while adjusted eps increased 14 to 1 16 these results reflect the strong credit quality i just mentioned as well as our continued consistent execution and solid operating leverage inherent in our online model during the quarter loans to new customers represented 26 of total originations in line with q1 of last year as we ve mentioned in the past these new customers ultimately expand our returning customer base and revenue potential going forward while our new customer mix was down slightly from the low 30s we saw in the back half of 2018 this is to be expected with typical first quarter seasonality driven by the tax return season in the u s as i mentioned we also saw excellent credit performance from our customers with noticeable improvements in credit quality across our portfolio and charge offs in line with our expectations while net charge offs were higher than last year this is largely a result of the high mix of new customers over the last several quarters as well as our ongoing portfolio mix shift to installment and line of credit products we are confident that our sophisticated analytics and over 15 years of experience as well as all of our data allows us to effectively maintain excellent credit quality across our products total companywide originations in the first quarter declined 3 year over year this was largely due to a tough comp as we did not experience the typical tax seasonality in 2018 which resulted in much higher than expected originations last year the 21 sequential decline in originations again reflects the seasonality we typically see in q1 combined with our ongoing diversification into loc and installment products this diversification can be seen in total a r which was up 16 year over year and down only 7 sequentially as steve will discuss in more detail the moderation of growth we saw in q1 resulted in adjusted ebitda and eps above our expectations while still delivering strong consistent revenue growth as expected in a year where we saw more typical seasonality in the first quarter originations have accelerated as we ve entered the second quarter we ve discussed on prior calls how managing growth can be challenging but our experienced team is able to leverage our sophisticated analytics models to respond rapidly to changes in demand by adjusting our marketing spend and credit cut offs our past results have demonstrated our ability to manage these growth versus profitability trade offs and we ll continue to focus on running the business with this balanced approach going forward we believe our strong performance is attributable to our focus on our 6 growth businesses namely our u s subprime business our u s near prime offering our u k consumer brands u s small business financing our installment loan business in brazil and enova decisions our analytics as a service business our large u s subprime consumer business generated another strong quarter of growth and profitability originations increased 6 year over year and the portfolio remains well diversified consisting of 52 line of credit products 34 installment products and only 14 single pay products we continue to believe there is a significant opportunity for future growth in the u s given the large addressable market and our single digit market share net credit loan balances increased 21 year over year to over 450 million and originations increased 8 year over year our u s near prime products represented 46 of our total portfolio at the end of q1 compared to 45 in q1 of last year netcredit has become a very large business yet we still see many avenues for future growth in the near prime market our first quarter u k revenue decreased 12 year over year on a constant currency basis primarily driven by the purposeful repositioning of our u k business to focus on installment offerings during the quarter we relaunched on stride financial our installment product in the u k on stride offers a variety of durations and a wider range of aprs and is resonating well with consumers there installment loan revenue in the u k increased 18 year over year and 26 on a constant currency basis overall we remain the leading subprime lender by market share in the u k and believe we are well positioned for future growth turning to small business as we discussed in our q4 earnings call in recent quarters we have seen a strengthening of demand for our small business products at attractive unit economics leading us to be moderately more assertive in expanding in this space the result was good growth in our small business financing products during q1 originations increased 58 year over year resulting in small business representing 10 of our total loan book at the end of q1 going forward we will be focused on maintaining growth in this market to the extent we continue to see attractive opportunities in brazil first quarter originations declined 13 year over year on a constant currency basis due to a difficult comparison to a strong q1 of last year in addition we intentionally slowed originations in brazil while we reconfigured certain operational practices to deal with new debiting practices implemented by the banks there brazil is one of our smaller businesses but we continue to see a large opportunity there with a huge population growing middle class and stable regulatory environment lastly enova decisions our real time analytics as a service business continues to develop their product offering and outreach to potential customers while this business remains in the early stages we still believe there are opportunities for us to use our sophisticated data and analytics to help other businesses with their decisioning before i wrap up i want to provide a brief regulatory update in march a federal judge ordered a stay on the august 2019 compliance date for the small dollar rule as you know earlier this year the cfeb announced it is revisiting the ability to repay portions of that rule the judge s stay also covers the payment provision in the rule right now it remains unclear how long that stay will remain and whether the payment provisions will also be revisited by the cfeb as with the ability to repay provision we believe the flexibility of our online platform diversified product offerings and our extensive experience navigating regulatory changes positions us well to succeed regardless of the outcome of the rulemaking and the litigation at the state level the california legislature is once again considering a number of bills dealing with consumer credit we have consistently supported good regulations based on facts that help consumers for example the senate banking committee in california passed a bill which we support that proposed a set of consumer oriented protections without restrictive rate caps our team will stay engaged as these bills progress through the summer in california separately oklahoma just passed a new installment lending bill which will open up a nice new product opportunity for us there when it takes effect next year overall we re off to a strong start in 2019 and are raising our outlook for the year as steve will describe in more detail as we have demonstrated we will continue to manage the business to effectively balance growth and profitability we believe our diversified revenue streams talented employees advanced technology world class analytics platform and strong competitive position set us up very well for the remainder of 2019 and beyond with that i ll turn the call over to steve who will provide more details on our financials and guidance and following his remarks we ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have steve steve cunningham chief financial officer thank you david and good afternoon everyone i ll start by reviewing our financial and operating performance for the first quarter of 2019 and then provide our outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2019 as david mentioned we are pleased to report another quarter of solid financial results with revenue in the middle of our guidance range and adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share exceeding our guidance financial results reflect our typical first quarter seasonality with sequential declines in originations receivables and revenue which contribute to strong bottom line profitability in fact net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share this quarter are all quarterly records for enova as a public company total first quarter 2019 revenue increased 15 to 293 million above the midpoint of our guidance range of 280 million to 300 million on a constant currency basis revenue increased 16 year over year revenue growth was driven by a 16 year over year increase in total company combined loan and finance receivables balances which grew to 980 million from 844 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018 installment loan and line of credit products continue to drive the growth in total loans and finance receivables balances total quarterly originations decreased 3 year over year which was primarily driven by our continued diversification to installment and line of credit products lower originations in our international businesses and currency headwinds total domestic originations increased 10 year over year compared to the year ago quarter as consumer line of credit originations rose 34 and small business originations increased 58 installment loans receivables purchase agreements and line of credit products now comprise nearly 84 of our total revenue and 93 of our total portfolio demonstrating our customers preference for these products domestic revenue increased 21 on a year over year basis and declined 4 sequentially to 258 million in the first quarter of 2019 domestic revenue accounted for 88 of our total revenue in the first quarter again this sequential decline in revenue is typical seasonality for our u s business revenue growth in our domestic operations was driven by a 33 year over year increase in line of credit revenue and a 17 increase in installment loan and rpa revenue continued strong demand for these products drove our domestic combined loan and finance receivables balances up 21 year over year international revenue decreased 15 from the year ago quarter to 35 million primarily due to the aforementioned repositioning of our u k business as well as currency headwinds on a constant currency basis international revenue decreased 8 on a year over year basis international revenue accounted for 12 of total revenue in the first quarter of 2019 total international loans decreased 13 compared to a year ago international installment loan balances increased 4 year over year while international short term loan balances decreased 47 year over year on a constant currency basis international loan balances decreased 5 year over year turning to gross profit margins our first quarter gross profit margin for the total company was near the high end of our guidance range expectations at 53 this compares to 57 in the year ago quarter as we have described in the past we typically see gross profit margin in the upper end of our guidance range during the first quarter of the year as we experience seasonally lower growth typical of this seasonality our gross profit margin improved from 43 in the fourth quarter of 2018 total company gross profit margin continues to reflect the solid credit quality of the portfolio overall the credit performance of the portfolio is stable and in line with our expectations we continually monitor the marginal and portfolio economics across our products and vintages and remain pleased with the returns we re generating on our originations net charge offs as a percentage of average combined loan and finance receivables increased in the first quarter to 15 8 from 13 7 in the prior year quarter this increase was expected given the rising proportion of new customers in our portfolio over the past several quarters and was reflected in our ratio of allowance and liability for losses as a percentage of gross loan and financing receivables at the end of the previous quarter which was 15 7 as david mentioned originations from new customers across all of our businesses were 26 of the total during the first quarter equal to the proportion from the year ago quarter at the end of the first quarter the allowance and liability for losses for the consolidated company as a percentage of combined gross loan and financing receivables was 14 6 compared to the year ago quarter of 13 7 the increase reflects the expectation of continued seasoning of new customer receivables originated in recent quarters for 2019 we continue to expect our consolidated gross profit margin to be in the range of 45 to 55 quarter to quarter our gross profit margin will be influenced by seasonality and growth characteristics including the pace of growth in originations the mix of new versus returning customers in originations and the mix of loans and financings in the portfolio our domestic gross profit margin was 56 in the first quarter compared to 59 in the first quarter of 2018 and 43 in the fourth quarter of 2018 our international gross profit margin was 28 in the first quarter compared to 51 in the prior year quarter the decrease in international gross profit margin from the year ago quarter was driven primarily by the seasoning of new customer originations in recent quarters and by the change in gross profit margin for international installment loans which reflects the recent growth of new customers from the purposeful repositioning of our u k business to focus on installment offerings as david mentioned earlier we expect our international gross profit margin in 2019 to be in the range of 45 to 55 slightly lower than our previous guidance as we grow and attract new customers in our international installment businesses as a reminder quarter to quarter the international gross profit margin will be influenced by seasonality and growth characteristics including the pace of growth in originations the mix of new versus returning customers in originations and the mix of loans and financings in the portfolio efficient marketing and operating leverage in our scalable online model contributed to our ability to generate record quarterly levels of profit while meeting customer demand during the first quarter of 2019 total operating expenses including marketing were 83 million or 28 of revenue compared to 80 million or 32 of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 we continue to see efficiency in our marketing spend marketing expenses in the first quarter declined 15 year over year to 24 million or 8 of revenue compared to 28 million or 11 of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 we expect marketing spend will range in the low to mid teens percentage of revenue in 2019 with the highest spend during our seasonal growth periods in the second half of the year operations and technology expenses totaled 30 million or 10 of revenue in the first quarter compared to 26 million or 10 of revenue in the first quarter of 2018 and were higher primarily from volume related variable expenses including ongoing expenses associated with complaints in the u k general and administrative expenses were 30 million or 10 of revenue in the first quarter compared to 27 million or 11 of revenue in the first quarter of the prior year and were higher primarily from higher personnel related expenses adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure reached a quarterly record of 75 million and increased 10 year over year in the first quarter our adjusted ebitda margin was 25 5 compared to 26 7 in the first quarter of the prior year our stock based compensation expense was 3 1 million in the first quarter which compares to 2 4 million in the first quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was 22 5 in the first quarter compared to a 20 8 rate in the first quarter of 2018 we expect our ongoing normalized effective tax rate to be in the mid 20 range net income increased to 35 million or 1 02 per diluted share in the first quarter from net income of 27 9 million or 0 81 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted earnings a non gaap measure increased to 39 9 million or 1 16 per diluted share from 35 4 million or 1 02 per diluted share in the first quarter of the prior year we continue to maintain a solid liquidity position with strong operating cash flows and meaningful available capacity in our financing facilities during the first quarter cash flows from operations totaled 222 million and we ended the quarter with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 93 million and total debt of 792 million our debt balance at the end of the quarter includes 99 million outstanding under our 350 million of combined installment loan securitization facilities and no amount outstanding under our 125 million corporate revolver now i d like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2019 we expect to see our typical seasonality quarterly seasonality during 2019 as we move through the year seasonal demand in originations typically increase from the first quarter low point and peak during the fourth quarter as we move into our faster growth periods seasonality typically generates sequential revenues that rise faster than adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as growth related provisioning lowers gross margins and outpaces scale benefits our outlook also reflects an expectation of continued faster growth relative growth in installment and line of credit products stable credit steady growth in the mix of new customers and originations no significant impacts to our businesses from regulatory changes and no significant volatility in the british pound from current levels as noted in our earnings release in the second quarter of 2019 we expect total revenue to be between 265 million and 285 million diluted earnings per share to be between 0 41 and 0 63 per share adjusted ebitda to be between 45 million and 55 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between 0 48 and 0 70 per share full year we continue to expect total revenue to be between 1 25 billion and 1 31 billion and are revising our full year profitability higher based on first quarter performance we now expect diluted earnings per share to be between 2 83 and 3 48 per share adjusted ebitda to be between 237 million and 267 million and adjusted earnings per share to be between 3 17 and 3 82 per share as david mentioned we remain well positioned and are very optimistic about our ability to generate growth and increase profitability for the remainder of 2019 and with that we would be happy to take your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you your first question will be coming from john hecht from jefferies please go ahead john hecht jefferies analyst good afternoon thanks guys i really just want to focus on the line of credit versus the installment loans both of them had good year over year growth but it s clear that in terms of origination trends and this and that that there s been higher factors tied to the line of credit i m wondering are those tied to some marketing strategic marketing changes or consumer demand or are you just seeing different geographic pockets david fisher chief executive officer so i think what you re seeing there is especially in counts as opposed to dollar amounts it s a big shift and it s really over the last several years in our subprime business from short term products to line of credit products it s the combination of states passing new line of credit laws opening up availability for us as well as us expanding into states that didn t have didn t prior have line of credit or short term products that now do have or single pay products that do have line of credit products so certainly in terms of counts because those are relatively small loan sizes those have the biggest impacts in installment you ll see that that s somewhat muted in terms of dollar amounts because of our larger net credit loans which is actually one of our fastest growing businesses as you ve seen over the last year or two john hecht jefferies analyst ok then maybe can you talk about what s say over the last year with respect to average balance of line of credit versus installment loan what s happened steve cunningham chief financial officer our average balances haven t really meaningfully changed over the past year john john hecht jefferies analyst ok so it s mix ok then you talked about the international gross margin i guess it was impacted this year relative to last year on a few factors and then you talked about the recovery over the course of the year how fast do you expect that to recover is that just a one quarter migration as you move things in the u k or is there something longer term david fisher chief executive officer it s definitely longer term it s a pretty big shift for us from the short term product to the installment product and as any product ramps up you obviously are booking a lot of those losses from new customers upfront and that will take many quarters to normalize it s really until the growth slows pretty meaningfully long term it s a great thing as we ve talked above customers really seem to like this new installment product it does have a very wide range of aprs as well as a wide range of loan sizes to that flexibility seems to be really resonating in the u k so we ve seen strong adoption stronger than we expected and that s what led to the drop in the gross margins there john hecht jefferies analyst relative to our model just much better leveraging of various expenses including marketing maybe can you give us a sense for how you re deploying marketing budget any changes to the different channels there and any different kind of efficacy rates and response rates you re seeing in these channels david fisher chief executive officer we saw decent rates in q1 again q1 is more typical seasonality i mean that s what we saw that s what we typically saw in the past last year was definitely an anomaly it was a surprise to us i think surprised everybody so we re kind of getting back to that we pulled way back in marketing in q1 this year we just pulled back a little bit more as we ve entered q2 we ve definitely seen a strengthening demand of demand post tax return season as would be expected and we are clearly leaning into the marketing i think over the last couple of years the big growth has been on the direct mail side and i think now we re seeing good success in tv actually and so we re leaning in on the tv side but these are fairly minor and longer term mix shifts in terms of marketing they re not dramatic they re not overnight but they have had the effect over say the last three to five years of greatly reducing our reliance on lead providers and controlling our destiny much more in terms of attracting new customers john hecht jefferies analyst guys thanks very much and congrats on a good quarter operator thank you your next question comes from david scharf jmp securities go ahead please david scharf jmp securities analyst thank you and thanks for taking my questions this afternoon david i wanted to actually follow up on the prior questions and discussion on marketing it s become pretty clear that you guys have demonstrated that the model has an awful lot of flexibility in terms of kind of managing to your earnings guidance particularly by throttling or pulling back on marketing spend i m just wondering just to give us maybe a broader sense for how to think about the range of marketing spend from quarter to quarter i know you ve given guidance as a percentage of revenue for the year but based on the scale you re at now is 23 5 million i mean should we think of that as a floor on quarterly spend that anything below that can t sustain this kind of growth david fisher chief executive officer yes so a couple of things good question we did not pull back on marketing in q1 to try to achieve higher profitability we generated above our guidance range and profitability just through normal operations we tried to make sure we were hitting our return thresholds with our marketing and not exceeding them and just given the lower levels of demand because of the tax return season that s where marketing played out so unlike q4 where we purposefully pulled back because of extremely strong levels of new customer growth we did not do that in q1 but still saw one of our lowest percentages of marketing marketing as a percentage of revenue we ve ever seen and so i would not expect in the future marketing in either absolute dollars or as a percentage of revenue to get much below that number that was a very very low number in terms of the ranges we would be very comfortable spending mid to upper teens as a percentage of revenue for marketing in a given quarter we found some opportunities to accelerate that kind of in the middle of last year and it paid off so well that we ended up having to pull back in the back quarter of the year the last quarter of the year right now we re seeing some good opportunities to deploy marketing dollars as we have kind of exited the tax return season and kind of moved into growth season again and that s why kind of our guidance for marketing for the year hasn t changed a lot we think we can deploy more marketing dollars throughout the year and we would like to if we can because that s great growth for the future every marketing dollar we spend we think we re spending at attractive unit economics and generating good returns for the business so if you re thinking about a range we would not expect to go below where we were in q1 certainly not in the back three quarters of year but really like in any quarter going forward although crazy things can happen and we will be happy to spend kind of in the upper teens if we find the right opportunities in some of the more growth quarters david scharf jmp securities analyst that s real helpful going forward hey maybe a question just a point of clarification i wanted to make sure i understood the commentary on international gross margins because on the one hand i thought i heard that the full year guidance was modestly trimmed a couple of percentage points but still in the 45 to 55 range yet a little later i thought david you may have said that those margins aren t going to snap back overnight off that 28 level in the first quarter and i m trying to reconcile those if you could comment on how to think about the trend over the course of the year steve cunningham chief financial officer yes david this is steve i think over the course of the year you ll see some of the return there but again it s not it won t be overnight that s really what david was talking about as we re making some of these transitions and purposeful repositioning so expect to see that but as i talked about in my commentary it s also going to depend on how fast we re growing if there is deviations from our new versus returning as we re looking to the future so that s probably the best way to think about it it was a fairly meaningful reduction we brought it down 5 points but again you should expect to see some normalization based on our best view going forward today david scharf jmp securities analyst ok got it then hey lastly for you steve this is more just sort of a mechanical question but it looks like your ebitda guidance for the year was taken up by 7 million both at the high and the low end yet the earnings guidance went up by about 0 40 which by my calculation that s roughly like 18 million pre tax sort of wondering is there sort of an 11 million reduction in sort of below the operating line assumptions i can take it offline if it s easier but i was just trying to reconcile steve cunningham chief financial officer really below ebitda the big two levers are financing and tax so i think our tax view has been pretty steady but we did expect to have maybe a slightly lower balance sheet than we did going into the year so if there s lower size balance sheet you have a lower level of financing needed against that so that s really the leverage you see below the ebitda line and we also had some mix shifts across our financing instruments as well david scharf jmp securities analyst all right operator thank you thank you i would now like to turn the conference back to david

share was 0 75 and combined u s comp sales were up 2 4 this was a terrific start to the year and represents the sixth consecutive quarter of positive u s comp sales all u s concepts finished with positive comp sales including an impressive 3 5 at outback in addition adjusted operating margins grew 70 basis points year over year on a comparable basis our strong first quarter results reflect the continued focus on core execution in the restaurant and ongoing monetization of the strategic investments made over the past three years we are well positioned to achieve our 2019 financial objectives i want to thank the over 90 000 team members in the field who bring to life the hospitality service and experience that make our restaurants so successful i would also like to thank my colleagues in the restaurant support center who provide great service to our partners your enthusiasm and dedication to always putting the customer first is making a difference each and every day as discussed at investor day our no 1 priority remains driving healthy profitable sales growth across the portfolio over the past three years we invested over 50 million back into the customer experience at the same time we pursued incremental levers to accelerate growth across the digital loyalty off premise and international importantly each of these key platforms are contributing to our sustained success and continued ability to take market share first the investments to fortify the core experience were prioritized toward customer facing improvements this included 30 million in food quality portion enhancements and reduced complexity and 20 million in service training and labor in addition we invested over 400 million in remodels to contemporize our brand and improve curb appeal customers have taken notice as we have seen strengthening brand health measures second the off premise business continues to perform very well delivery is now available in over 550 locations across outback and carrabba s as of the end of q1 these locations are exceeding benchmarks against several key metrics including delivery time and we are pleased with the pace of the delivery ramp up importantly this business is profitable now that the business is reaching scale we will begin augmenting existing local marketing efforts with additional tactics to drive awareness we remain very excited about the incremental opportunity it represents as we capitalize on the growing consumer demand for enjoying restaurant meals at home third the successful dine rewards loyalty program now has over 8 5 million members the program is driving strong engagement across the portfolio we are leveraging the risk data we have collected over the years to enhance the customer segmentation opportunities our investments in it and crm enable more customer centric communications such as dine rewards member only invitations to theme dinners like carrabba s carnevale event this reallocation of marketing spend toward more digital provides a higher roi while reducing overall advertising spend lastly the international business continues to exceed expectations especially in brazil comp sales were up 3 7 with significant margin expansion we enjoy high brand regard and consumer engagement the market is still under penetrated and we have a potential to build another 50 outbacks for a total of 150 outbacks in brazil new restaurants continue to generate among the highest returns in the portfolio providing increased confidence in the plan in addition we have two emerging opportunities in brazil the first is abbraccio with growing sales and economics we currently have 12 locations and believe there s a potential for at least 50 locations the second is the rapidly growing delivery business we have a great local partner and currently have delivery in 12 locations with the opportunity to add many more a large incremental sales opportunity exists with delivery and customer feedback is extremely high these investments in key platforms help fortify the core business and expand our reach to new and existing customers we will continue to leverage our scale portfolio of brands and data analytics to enhance engagement and drive increased profitability we are clearly going to become an even better and more efficient restaurant company this starts by growing sales through the levers we just discussed and tightly managing costs while monetizing our investments we are already seeing the benefit of this focus as adjusted operating margins expanded by 70 basis points on a comparable basis in the first quarter now turning to outback outback comp sales were up 3 5 in the first quarter on top of an already strong 4 3 increase in q1 2018 this is outback s ninth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales we are benefiting from the ongoing returns from the investments in customer experience in addition we are seeing success with enhancements to the service model to strengthen customer engagement service represents a key priority and differentiator for the brand as outback remains focused on creating memorable dining experiences for its consumers every day we remain committed to refreshing our assets outback is testing multiple interior remodel prototypes the new designs modernize the look while expanding the off premise room to handle the higher expected order volume we are also relocating outback restaurants as quickly as quality sites become available this relocation program continues to deliver impressive results and recent relocations are generating sales lifts in excess of 30 outback remains well positioned to take further market share chris will provide more detail on the quarterly sales performance at carrabba s bonefish and fleming s in a moment but let me briefly summarize what we are trying to accomplish across these brands no 1 invest behind and simplify operations to enhance the core guest experience two offer unique and brand appropriate programs such as wine dinners at carrabba s to drive frequency three continue to opportunistically remove unprofitable discounting and invest in our people to continue to lower turnover and increase engagement importantly every brand posted positive comp sales and experienced margin expansion in the first quarter in summary the first quarter was an excellent start to the year we are excited about the prospects ahead and look forward to updating you as the year progresses and with that i ll turn the call over to chris meyer to provide more detail on q1 chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone i ll kick off with discussion around our sales and profit performance for the quarter i d like to remind everyone that when i speak to results i ll be referring to adjusted numbers that exclude certain costs and benefits please see the earnings release for reconciliations between non gaap metrics and the most directly comparable u s gaap measures we also provided a discussion of the nature of each adjustment with that in mind our first quarter financial results versus the prior year were as follows gaap diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 69 versus 0 68 in 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 75 versus 0 71 last year when evaluating our results it is important to keep in mind that our 0 71 from q1 2018 included a 0 03 benefit for the amortization of deferred gains from our sale leaseback transactions upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard we no longer recognize these deferred gains in our financial statements if you exclude this 0 03 impact of the new lease accounting standard from our q1 2018 results our adjusted eps would have been 0 68 on that basis our q1 2019 adjusted eps grew 10 from 0 68 last year to 0 75 in 2019 this growth is in line with our full year guidance the primary difference between our first quarter gaap and adjusted eps is related to certain restructuring relocation and restaurant closing costs excluded from the 2019 and 2018 first quarter results total revenues increased 1 to 1 1 billion in the first quarter and u s comp sales were up 2 4 in line with our full year guidance of 2 to 2 5 this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales for the combined u s portfolio u s traffic was down 90 basis points this was a little lower than expected due to an estimated 30 basis points of unfavorable weather a larger reduction in discounts than originally planned at outback and pockets of category softness in florida and texas where we index high we do not expect this regional softness to continue in the back half of the year in addition keep in mind that outback s q1 2018 traffic of 2 2 was the highest we posted all last year given this and the many levers dave discussed we remain confident in our ability to grow traffic in 2019 on a combined u s portfolio basis as it relates to our concepts outback comps were up 3 5 this is outback s ninth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales we continue to benefit from the ongoing monetization of our investments in food quality and portion enhancements in addition improved rois in our marketing programs and the growth of our loyalty platform allowed us to opportunistically reduce traditional discounting in q1 by 17 relative to last year this benefit showed up in increased check average finally our delivery rollout continues to go smoothly and we are seeing growth against several key metrics carrabba s comp sales were up 30 basis points we are seeing growth in our off premise business through catering delivery and our family bundle take home meals we also continue to focus on operational simplification as well as proprietary programs such as amore monday to drive dinner traffic bonefish grill comps were up 1 9 driven by the success of our ocean mixed grill and 3 course lobster dinner promotions these differentiated offerings helped both traffic as well as check average in q1 in the fourth quarter of last year we made the decision at bonefish to reduce the number of gift cards sold through discount channels some of these channels charge higher fees and it made financial sense to reduce our reliance on these types of discounts this reduction negatively impacted q1 traffic by an estimated 150 basis points since most holiday gift cards are redeemed in the first quarter this change did have a positive impact on profitability and margins that being said we are excited about the future growth potential of bonefish grill as we continue to revitalize this strong lifestyle brand comp sales at fleming s were up 60 basis points of all of our brands fleming s was the most impacted by unfavorable weather which we estimated lowered their q1 comp sales by 110 basis points in addition as we have discussed previously in q2 of 2018 we made the conscious decision at fleming s to move away from legacy value offerings such as our 567 bar menu while these actions have a short term negative impact on traffic they have had a positive impact on check average and profitability comp sales in brazil were up 3 7 we were pleased with this result and as a reminder brazil has had positive comp sales since the acquisition aside from two quarters where we faced unprecedented economic and political turmoil this business has strong consumer appeal and is well positioned for growth as the country emerges from the political and economic challenges faced in 2018 adjusted operating income margin was 7 8 in q1 this was up an impressive 70 basis points after adjusting 2018 for the impact of the lease accounting change there are a few key drivers of this improvement in operating margin first our 2 4 combined u s sales comp was driven by improved check average and fewer discounts second our margins benefited significantly from ongoing productivity efforts particularly in the area of food waste third we continue to find efficiencies on our marketing spend as we pivot away from mass marketing to higher roi digital spend finally in our international segment adjusted operating margins went from 8 7 in q1 of 2018 to 12 3 in q1 of 2019 an improvement of 360 basis points year over year our brazil business continues to perform at a high level and as we grow this market it will have increased visibility in our consolidated bloomin brands margins overall this was a very strong start to the year in demonstrating our ability to grow margins as we indicated at investor day the quarterly contribution of each of our levers may vary but they will all play a key role in closing the margin gap to our peers moving to tax our q1 adjusted tax rate was approximately 8 this was in line with our expectations on the development front we opened six systemwide locations in the first quarter including five international locations and one domestic outback location finally we are reconfirming all aspects of our guidance including our expectations for comp sales margin growth and eps for the year in summary q1 was a solid start to the year for bloomin brands we had healthy sales growth and strong management of our restaurant expenses has led to significant margin improvement in the quarter our strong start has positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 objectives and with that we will now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays please proceed with your question jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst great thank you very much two things one just on the comp outlook i mean it looks like from a growth perspective 2019 you re still expecting positive traffic across the portfolio yet they seem to be down in terms of traffic in the first quarter so on the flip side the average check was as you mentioned up significantly at the outbacks i m just wondering if you could talk about the balance of why you expect maybe the traffic to improve and or maybe the average check to ease as we think about outback and the broader portfolio through the year and then i had one follow up dave deno chief executive officer sure thanks jeff i m happy to see the sales we had in the first quarter the comps were above the industry average as was traffic and as chris mentioned although the traffic was a little bit lighter than we expected but we re quite pleased with what the quarter turned in and also what the rest of the year looks like so let me just talk about the quarter and then we can talk about the i can talk about the balance of the year and chris can turn to guest check average first of all outback comped year over year at 2 2 positive traffic benefit in q1 so that was something to consider we had about 30 basis points of unfavorable weather in q1 results and we did see pockets of category softness in florida and texas where we do have a lot of restaurants we expect this mainly due to the bounce back from the hurricane last year so we don t expect the traffic trends in florida and texas to be a challenge in the balance of the year in fact we expect the results to improve and then finally as chris mentioned in his remarks discounts at outback were down 17 in q1 as we moved away from some things that we ve always been looking at and bonefish did some stuff with their gift cards through a discount channel that we thought would be better off somewhere else and we didn t want to go through that discount channel now as it relates to the balance of the year first of all our ongoing benefits from our investments in customer experience are really paying off in brand health measures and other things and that s in food and service second we ve got the off premise business that we ve worked so hard to build and we re so happy to have our channel third we talked about our loyalty program that has 8 5 million members we re learning more and more about marketing each and every day on the digital side and what we can do there and increasing return on investment and also managing our spending and lastly we ve got our relocation and remodel programs so jeff as we look at the balance of the year these are the levers that we re going to continue to use as we go forward so i ll turn it over to chris now to talk about ppa chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and as it relates to check average jeff i think that we would anticipate check average to ease as the year progresses as we stated at investor day we expect to be very prudent in our thoughts around menu pricing moving forward so we would expect pricing to ratchet down as the year progresses and concurrent with that as dave mentioned we would expect traffic to start to ratchet up so it s all within the context of our 2 to 2 5 sales guidance that we gave out for the year jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst gotcha and then my one other clarification or question i know you reiterated all key components of guidance for 19 just specific to the commodity outlook i think it was a 2 basket wondering if you could talk a little bit about this in terms of whatever you re willing to share in terms of percent locked and whether that s up or down it seems that there s been a lot more talk lately about pressure potentially from african swine fever i m just wondering how you guys are positioned and where you think the commodity basket will play out as we move through the year chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no jeff we re in pretty good shape as it relates to beef for this year our overall commodity basket i m not going to give specific to beef but our overall commodity basket is actually a bit more locked at this point in time than it was last year at this point in time for us as we look at commodity headwinds i think that seafood has been the biggest driver of our inflation this year jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jeff farmer with gordon haskett please proceed with your question jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst thank you at the analyst day you pointed to 50 direct delivery units that have already seen off premise exceed i think it was 20 of sales mix so just curious what are the common characteristics of those units that have delivered that outsized off premise sales mix growth do you guys think that there s opportunities to see a large part of the system delivery at a similar level of off premise sales mix dave deno chief executive officer yes the main thing of anything on delivery is obviously the trade area is important but the talent engagement and operations of the restaurant partner is so important and we see restaurants that have incredible dine in business also do an absolutely incredible delivery business and i just want to say thanks to the restaurant partners out there that have really done a fantastic job on delivery for us as we built the system and they re just doing a great job and we re going to see more and more of these number of restaurants achieving these sales levels i m not going to get into each one and how quickly and things like that but it s just been so gratifying to see people get after this and look at our off premise opportunity both from a carryout and a delivery standpoint so jeff it s the common element is just the talent and leadership of our managing partners out there jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst and then just as a follow up i d like to drill down on that margin opportunity a little bit more so going back to at least 2012 the ipo bloomin has been guiding this 50 million in annual cost savings i know there s a lot of moving pieces there but as you look forward to 19 20 21 what are still some of the lower hanging opportunities you see in terms of pursuing cost savings moving forward chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we still in q1 we did really well with our food waste opportunity we also saw benefits on our distribution network energy r m dwl so it s pretty wide ranging we still have runway left over the next few years as we continue to execute against these opportunities in these areas such as waste and even in labor opportunities remain outside the restaurant with optimizing our supply chain logistics distribution activities we re working on a pipeline of ideas that can serve us well in the future as well such as incorporating technology into our restaurants leveraging high performance kitchens kds systems technology will be a big part of our leverage of productivity in the years to come this year though there are still a lot of low hanging fruit as it relates to opportunities in cost of goods sold and in restaurant operating expenses dave deno chief executive officer and jeff what i like about it is if you look at the capability of our organization to achieve this i ve already talked about the restaurant managing partners doing a great job on this but if you look at a very talented supply chain organization that manages food costs and distribution costs so well the group that the work the technology group is doing we re learning more and more about digital every day and the rois that come from that so i like the capability we have also within our company to achieve these results jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with j p morgan please proceed with your question john ivankoe j p morgan analyst hi first thank you just a clarification there is so many moving pieces in your same store traffic from 2016 to 2018 at the outback brand i just wanted to kind of verify given there is two year and three year comparisons which do vary quite widely especially in 2017 that you do view the first quarter of 19 as having the most difficult traffic comparison and that because of that comparison we should expect an acceleration plus all the other initiatives that you expect to drive sales in that regard dave deno chief executive officer yes john i think if you look at it correct me if i m wrong chris but the first quarter of 2019 had the big chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer 2018 dave deno chief executive officer sorry first quarter of 2018 the quarter we just left has the biggest traffic level john ivankoe j p morgan analyst yes that s true and i asked the question even going back to 2017 that we started the year in 2017 with traffic of down 2 1 and ended the year in the fourth quarter 17 with traffic about 4 3 so there is that very very we saw this major acceleration in traffic in 2017 some of that was actually explained by 2016 that in other words this is more than just a one year phenomenon and i m just asking that we re thinking about those two year and three year trends now i suppose kind of acknowledging those in the future dave deno chief executive officer yes we absolutely look at our trends but more importantly john we look at what we re doing in our restaurants right we look at the service that gregg scarlett and team his under his leadership at outback what we re doing on food and service and what s all the hip great things they re doing there and the different levers that we talked about be it delivery be it loyalty be it the remodels etc yes of course we look at the trends but also we what s very important is what we re doing for ourselves with our brand in our restaurants as we continue to grow that business john ivankoe j p morgan analyst ok great that s what i was hoping to hear just a couple more if i may are there any tactical changes that we might expect with the dine rewards program obviously there s a pretty considerable benefit that the consumer gets and there might even be some arbitrage that exists between brands of you re kind of earning points at one and redeeming at another i mean are there any changes that you see that could potentially optimize either one kind of the customer response to the program or secondly the profitability from this program dave deno chief executive officer sure with 8 5 million members we re really pleased with where we re at all brands are participating we really like what each brands are seeing the return on investment is there and growing of course we ll always look at how we can make the program better for our customers for our company and everything else but we don t expect any major changes to it but we ll always be looking at how we can make it better and better and better and we think it s one of the best programs in all of the restaurant business so each brand is participating return on investment is improving and we really look forward to now really using that database we have that s what people forget we have a database that we can use to help market to our key customers so that s a big part of this john ivankoe j p morgan analyst and then a final one i mean and this is from the analyst day i mean i think you guys discussed a dine in average ticket of 54 but a delivery ticket of 42 if i m remembering that correctly with most of that gap being beverages which is obviously a very very high margin ticket i mean is there anything that you can do that could kind of shrink that gap and that loss of profit from beverage sales in the delivery transaction versus the dine in transaction to where we don t have to worry about the profitability of those transactions going forward if incrementality over time proves to be a little bit less than what it is today dave deno chief executive officer yes i think john i think first of all you hit it the incrementality piece is important for us and we re seeing the incrementality in that business secondly i think how we market it how we service it using e commerce to help grow that guest check because what we see when people order stuff online as opposed to calling they build the gap check and so as we offer more service better service better marketing we can certainly hope to grow that guest check in delivery chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and one thing i would add john is that one of the advantages of having your own delivery network is that you have the ability to tweak the operating model as you see fit and we can make changes that can enhance profit ability enhance the experience for our guests that is one of the advantages we have with having our own drivers john ivankoe j p morgan analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley please proceed with your question john glass morgan stanley analyst thanks very much and good morning dave deno chief executive officer good morning john glass morgan stanley analyst can you just drill down a little on the restaurant level operating margin improvement this quarter a lot of it came from the other operating expense line and if i look from last year i think that s even where you got some of the sales leaseback benefits so i think the improvement there is even more pronounced is that a function primarily of reduction in advertising and can you just help us quantify this it sounded like this quarter in particular you removed some advertising and maybe that was or discount i don t know if that s reflected in the advertising line or not could you help us understand what are the drivers for that improvement i mean if it s a reduction in say media spend how much that may have been chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i ll give you the broader context and then i ll specifically go into restaurant operating expenses so if you think about broadly our improvement in restaurant margin we have always said the most important component of this margin journey is sales growth so the 2 4 combined u s comp sales was a key driver of margin expansion and that did have an impact on restaurant operating expenses and i would say that s the largest contributor to that line item specifically secondly we have we do have success with our productivity initiatives in the areas of food waste but i also mentioned areas like energy and utilities things like that so that impacted restaurant operating expenses as well and then finally as it relates to the u s business there was that shift in more dollars to digital marketing so we did see efficiencies in our overall marketing expenses so and that was probably 20 to 30 basis points of the improvement in the restaurant operating expense line hopefully that gives you a little more context dave deno chief executive officer yes and i think too john as we look at it this is that s a really important point because as we look at return on investment on those advertising dollars it doesn t necessarily mean that the advertising piece we re cutting advertising we re going to manage advertising we see great ideas and great roi we re going to continue to manage that line item so it will and as chris mentioned in his remarks each of these line items will have an impact on our restaurant profitability let me just add one more thing because i think it gets overlooked when we talk about margins and that is the remarkable performance in brazil this quarter i mean you saw our international segment up significantly in margins and that plays that comes into our consolidated results and played a piece in it so when you see sales growth like that margin growth significant margin growth and our new units going up that are so successful i just want to highlight that business one last time it is part of the margin story john glass morgan stanley analyst that s very helpful and can you kind of maybe some metrics on the off premise and total growth this quarter what the growth of the off premise business was what the contribution the percentage of sales and the growth there so we can just understand what contribution that has to the total comp growth dave deno chief executive officer sure so if you look i ll talk to what the impact is to outback and carrabba s because fleming s and bonefish have a relatively small business when it comes to off premise but it was 14 of our business and that s the total off premise which is carryout and delivery it s 14 of our business in q1 and 19 growth in carrabba s and outback ok chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes just to be clear when we say 14 that s 14 of the total business of outback and carrabba s dave deno chief executive officer right john glass morgan stanley analyst ok and you did close some express units this quarter i think and you those are relatively recent openings is that a shift in how you think about how you want to approach off premise or what was the rationale behind that if that is correct that you closed them dave deno chief executive officer yes no those are r d labs so we still have some that are open they are doing well and we re going to continue to work that business hard because we think it is part of our portfolio but as we do these experimental r d type restaurants we ll have openings and closures and stuff and i m just glad to be the leader of a company that s so agile and willing to do these things and we ll continue to work on these opportunities john glass morgan stanley analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from the line of andrew strelzik with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning so i was wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on the international margin expansion most of the dynamics that you called out some were u s centric so i m wondering what specifically was driving it on the international side it seems like given the magnitude it has to be more than comps and importantly as you re going to be lapping bigger margin declines over the next couple of quarters from last year and kind of softer operating performance on the top line as well is this kind of a repeatable type of margin expansion in the international segment for the next couple of quarters dave deno chief executive officer are we so that question was specifically around international right andrew andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst correct dave deno chief executive officer ok so brazil has the same opportunities in productivity and management that our u s business has and pierre and his team have just done a great job pursuing that so when you take the volumes that they have and you layer on sales growth like chris said earlier sales growth is first and foremost in margin expansion and we ll never lose sight of that but that doesn t mean we don t manage our expenses and pursue our opportunities so pierre has taken opportunities in food costs he did a fantastic job managing labor down there and in other parts of his p l and the other thing that is exciting about brazil we talked a lot about delivery here in the u s brazil was also pursuing their delivery opportunity they re doing it with a third party because we re still mall based there and the third party has good access to malls and things but they re really doing a fantastic job on taking that opportunity in brazil so i think we can certainly see continued margin improvement in brazil and see the sales that we have and we really enjoy and chris mentioned it in his opening remarks we bought the business in 2013 we ve had positive same store sales growth in that business every quarter except for the two that had some economic and political turmoil associated with it but that s the power of that business down there and the opportunity that represents in both sales and margin expansion andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst great and one other one if i could with the growth of the off premise business and maybe more group orders and things like that i know you called out some of the traffic dynamics this quarter at outback but i guess i m just wondering is there another maybe internal metric that you look at that might better judge what the number of customers that you re really serving where traffic might be understating that dave deno chief executive officer i ll try to i think i understand the question if i missed it let me know but we do look at the different types of delivery out there by restaurant so we have catering and we look at that mix which is really a great opportunity especially at carrabba s italian grill we look at that opportunity a large part is catering we look at the number of deliveries we look at our off premise business so we can segment it quite well by restaurant to understand where the opportunities are within our company and believe me we re pursuing them chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer and by channel right as well dave deno chief executive officer yes sure chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer and by channel meaning whether we do an online order they call in orders so there s a lot of different metrics we look at andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst ok great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian vaccaro with raymond james please proceed with your question brian vaccaro raymond james analyst thanks and good morning just a quick follow up on the other opex line this quarter i m curious was the component of the year on year leverage that you saw related to lapping investments or outsized other cost inflation that might have occurred in the first quarter last year and are there any lumpy comparison that we should just be mindful of as we think about q2 through q4 chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer nothing that jumps out at me brian in terms of lumpy comparisons moving forward restaurant operating expense line like i said in q1 had a lot to do with average unit volume appreciation initiatives in the productivity line and in the marketing line as well everything else is kind of cats and mice and there s not a whole lot of other things to talk about there was obviously some inflation but it was pretty minimal most of our inflation is isolated to the cost of goods sold and the labor line brian vaccaro raymond james analyst ok and thinking about the q1 comps and i guess outback specifically you mentioned weather a 30 bps bad guy but were there also any calendar shifts worth noting whether it be new year s eve or the easter and spring break shifts so anything worth calling out there chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely so weather was 30 basis points holiday shift was positive 20 basis points for us but there were two components to that right so we had the new year s eve shift at the beginning of the year that was favorable to us and then you had easter toward the back end of the quarter that was slightly unfavorable the net of those two things was a positive 20 basis points so all in all between weather and between holiday it was pretty pretty immaterial i guess the holiday shift we kind of knew about coming into the quarter the weather we didn t know dave deno chief executive officer and the other thing brian i just want to add and chris talked about earlier was we made a really good conscious decision to manage our discounting down a bit at outback and so it was about 100 and that was about 17 down in discounts so it had impact as well on traffic so that was all but it s all planned that was all part of our planning and it s certainly embedded in our guidance brian vaccaro raymond james analyst ok and on the discount topic and thinking about year on year rest of the year how do those comparisons look does that start to normalize in q2 at outback dave deno chief executive officer yes it will at outback it will normalize but we re always we re always going to be looking at how we come to market and things like that but as you followed our story for so long you know that we ve been trying to remove discounting of our portfolio and really focus on other parts of the business but we ll always look at where we stand within the company and making investments behind digital marketing and things like that so and i m not obviously for competitive reasons not going to get into that but we ll continue our path on trying to remove unprofitable discounting growing healthy traffic but we ll always be looking at how we go to market chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think that the improvement that we re seeing in some of the digital spend the rois as they improve it gives us a lot more flexibility to make these kind of decisions brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right that s great and then just last one for me on free cash flow i think 2018 around 80 million if memory serves i think it was suppressed by a few unusual items and timing etc could you walk through a couple of those items for us and then maybe as you think about your 2019 what does your 19 guidance sort of result in from a free cash flow perspective maybe a range on 19 free cash flow chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so as you look at 2018 and 80 million is the right context if you re looking at it from an operating cash flow minus capex perspective i would say that you had the 53rd week dynamic which was huge we did make a pretty opportunistic commodity buy which was north of 30 million at the end of last year so there were some shifts certainly in working capital and one of the tricky things about our year end is because our year end is december 31 and then changes as the year as we work toward another 53rd week you do have this gift card timing we do all these gift card sales right at the end of the year and then when you receive payment can have a huge impact on working capital so those shifts at the end of the year can get a little bit noisy but what i can tell you is moving forward and we did have this context we re not going to give specific cash flow guidance for 2019 however we do expect cash flow to be well in excess of the 100 million that we discussed at analyst day and again we feel really good about all the levers we have to grow margin sales as well as cash flow and i think the most important aspect of the cash flow conversation is that we have sufficient cash flow to meet all of our business needs and we will have excess funds available to return cash to shareholders brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gregory francfort with bank of america please proceed with your question gregory francfort bank of america analyst hey guys thanks for the question the first one was just is there any shift in the timing of easter that impacts your business or spring break holidays and then the second one was as i look at tax rate through the year and i know the full year guidance has been i think at 7 to 8 is that supposed to be relatively steady or would you expect some volatility in that line chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer the tax rate we should we would expect to be fairly steady i would think as the year progresses there s always going to be discrete items within quarters that can make that thing ebb and flow up and down as it relates to easter shift i would say when we call we talked about the holiday shift being positive 20 the new year s eve shift to the beginning of the quarter was probably 40 basis points positive easter was probably 20 basis points negative so those things largely offset but we did see some negative easter impact spring break shift timing q1 is always a little noisy because of those things gregory francfort bank of america analyst and then maybe just one on the discounting what s been the overall customer response i guess you guys see internal metrics that we can t see and what has been the big changes that that s had on your customer either perception or customer behavior just generally in the bloomin business dave deno chief executive officer yes we track brand health measures very carefully they re improving as a direct result of the investments we ve made in service in food and everything else and removing the unprofitable discounting so as we ve gone through this journey every week every month we track it by brand and look at our brand health measures that i think everybody is familiar with i won t mention all those but it s a really important part of our business and will be going forward gregory francfort bank of america analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matthew difrisco with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst thank you my question is with respect to the carrabba s refranchising was there any benefit i can t necessarily pull that out of the income statement in your earnings or your ebitda and then also a follow up to that i m just curious is this is there opportunity for both the bonefish brand or carrabba s brand domestically to potentially refranchise more of some of the lower margin market that could also help aid your aggregate corporate margins dave deno chief executive officer yes it we had refranchising was de minimis on our financials there s not much there at all it is more about how we go to market in certain periods and also we really have a great franchise partner i mean the guy is remarkable that bought these restaurants we know him well he s going to do a fantastic job and so we ll always look as we talked in the past matt we ll always be looking at how we go to market around the u s but we see our core competency as owning and operating restaurants it doesn t mean that we won t refranchise here and there and look at things it won t mean that we ll maybe expand more bonefish into certain key areas as company owned and things we ll be looking at all of those things as we go forward but we want to make sure that we bring the brands to market to our best ability and also the best possible return for our shareholders and that s the kind of work that we re try and do each quarter matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst has the benefit though i know you said it s not that large but is it in the g a line if you could just quantify if there was a benefit to that chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer there wasn t any benefit this quarter and frankly it s only a handful of restaurants and it s a small amount dave deno chief executive officer yes it s a small amount matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst all right guys thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon tower with wells fargo please proceed with your question jon tower wells fargo securities analyst hey thanks so you ve been pulling back on unprofitable discounting across the portfolio for a few years now and it has resulted in a bit of traffic headwind across the business but and it s also been in the context of the best casual dining environment in well over three years now so can you talk about how you plan to use this discounting lever in future periods particularly if and when the overall industry slows down dave deno chief executive officer well jon if we look at how we re running our company it s clearly we will invest in the customer experience and become an even better restaurant operating company that s the first and foremost thing we can do in becoming a more efficient company as well so we re going to start there then when you look at we have a really good sense of our discounting and our advertising investments and what kind of returns we get on those and so as the casual dining market fluctuates up and down we ll be able to make some decisions as to what we want to do and we have a great deal of knowledge on that i m just glad that we ve gone on this journey over the last couple of years to attack unprofitable discounting and to reinvest in the customer experience for competitive reasons i m not going to get into what our future plans look like but i can assure you that we have a really good pulse of what the customer is doing what it means for advertising what we do for our promotions as we go forward operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to dave deno for closing remarks dave deno chief executive officer well we appreciate everybody joining us today we look forward to talking about our company in july on our second quarter earnings release and i hope in the meantime everybody has a chance to visit our restaurants where you re going to get some great food and service i want to thank everybody again for being on the call have a great day operator duration 47

you have to give it up for the republicans when it comes to consistency concerning government policies if it helps corporations and the wealthy they love it but when it comes to programs that actually help people they slam it as socialism that was one of the many compelling points nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz made in our discussion this week on salon talks about his new book the price of inequality how today s divided society endangers our future stiglitz who served as chair of president bill clinton s council of economic advisers explained in a brief yet instructive history lesson how the right has long sought to oppose programs that help everyday americans by dubbing them socialism back when franklin roosevelt introduced social security some people called it socialist now everyone is in favor of social security he added when lyndon johnson introduced medicare some republicans said that s socialism today you ask one person on medicare whether they re socialist no and the fact is that it produced a health care for the aged that has worked and it s one of the reasons why we have seen extended longevity as stiglitz makes clear none of the 2020 democrats are pushing for socialism in the classical sense of government controlling the means of production rather the leading democratic presidential candidates today like in the past are pushing for programs that help americans in a range of areas from health care to education stiglitz who also wrote the 2013 new york times bestseller the price of inequality addressed how income inequality today has also given rise to political inequality he rightly notes that so many believe our political system today is rigged to favor the wealthy which is spreading a sense of discontent that could lead to people checking out of our political system stiglitz is clear that we need laws that will curb although not eliminate the influence and power of money in our political system he also offers a similar analysis for the growing concentration of corporate power in america which has led to an increasing number of monopolies in areas like prescription drugs and he delivers a cautionary note about trump taken from the lessons of history which he says shows parallels between 1930 s germany and the rise of the nazis to power and while stiglitz is deeply concerned by these parallels he s still optimistic that our nation will correct itself clearly that depends on us watch my salon talks episode with joseph stiglitz here or read the transcript of the conversation below this transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and length your book gives a history of how we got here and prescriptions going forward but first i want to ask you about the 2020 campaign you have actual 2020 candidates asking if they embrace capitalism can you explain to us from an economist s point of view simply what is capitalism joseph stiglitz these are words that we create to try to summarize a complex economic system it used to be that the word capitalism was used pejoratively it was capital the owners the means of production were using their economic power to exploit workers then milton friedman turned it around and said capitalism is a virtue not a vice and said it s what makes our economy great so capitalism became a good thing then now back in those days socialism was about government ownership of the means of production have you heard any political candidate on any spectrum saying the government should take over the steel mills or the coal mines no no of course not of course not so we re not talking about socialism we re not talking about maduro in venezuela we re not talking about that so socialism really is the government takes over the means of productions banks farms companies and then dictates what will be produced what s not going to be produced and picks essentially the winners and losers of our economy is that accurate that was socialism a hundred and some years ago so that s what it meant more in a classical definition of socialism in the classical definition and after the experiences of the last 150 years no one is in favor of that kind of socialism but there s a very different kind in europe it s called social democrats and in europe sometimes there are even parties called socialist parties but they don t believe in that classical form of socialism if you listened carefully the other night at the fox news town hall where bernie sanders tried to articulate what he stood for he says he thinks the economy ought to be serving individuals who could be against that that the purpose of the economy is to serve society not the other way around so that is what he means by democratic socialism the kinds of agenda that he s talking about are things that again most americans believe social security back when franklin roosevelt introduced social security some people called it socialist everybody s in favor of social security i don t know anybody who says because i m in favor of social security i m a socialist no nobody would say that when lyndon johnson introduced medicare some of the republicans said that s socialism today you ask one person on medicare whether they re a socialist no the republicans even had ronald reagan going around the country lobbying for them saying medicare is socialism it s the same exact language we hear today yeah and the fact is it produced a health care for the aged that has worked and has been one of the reasons why we ve had extended longevity so again it s part of making sure that everybody in the country has access to health care is part of the social democratic agenda in europe and part of what s called the democrat socialist agenda in the united states no one could disagree with that access to education for everybody now is that socialism i don t think so i think that s again good investment if i were trying to say what is the most important investment that a society can make it s in their people if you re born poor you don t have the wherewithal to make those investments so for society to make those investments and then reap the returns the guy is going to be making higher incomes and because he s making higher income he ll be paying more in taxes the government will get back the return in the form of higher taxes that s just good investment policy so i wouldn t call that socialist i would call that just good policy it s great that you point out that on the right medicare social security even the aca was called socialism to them it seems like if it s not helping corporations or the top one percent it s socialism the only thing that s not socialism is that now explain to me the title of your book and how can you be a progressive and a capitalist at the same time what i mean by progressive capitalism is that the word capitalist is to remind us that the market is going to be a big part of the economy none of us want to run steel mills or coal mines but there are many things that the market on its own won t provide like good annuities health care unemployment insurance you tell me what private company is providing unemployment insurance today all these other forms of social protection so to me what i see progressive capitalism is just another way of saying a mixed economy with better balance between the market and collective action between the state and i also include civil society here because that s an important part of our institutional structure sure absolutely i come from universities some of our best universities are not state universities they re not for profits the only for profit universities are things like trump university that have excelled in only one thing figuring out how to rob people s pockets and exploit the most vulnerable members or our society when we start thinking about how our economy actually works it actually has a broad ecology of institutional arrangements and what i m calling for in progressive capitalism is just a shorthand for saying let s get a better balance that we need the state collective action not only to temper the market and make sure we don t pollute the environment have banks that engage in excessive risk taking or in abusive practices that we have adequate safety health all these kinds of things that s a regulatory framework which i think is core and we who live in new york city know that without simple regulations like stop lights which say who can go first and then who can take a turn we would be a massive gridlock we couldn t survive that s one part which is the regulation but the other part is there are many services that the market simply won t provide or provide adequately so basic research which is the basis of the growth of our economy why our standard of living is higher than it was 50 100 150 years ago the private market doesn t engage in adequate amounts of basic research i talked about education for those who are poor as you document in your book a big swath of american has not seen their income go up for decades now even for a generation to be blunt they feel like the system is rigged so when they hear a bernie sanders or donald trump saying it s rigged it resonates with them because they re not seeing any growth they re seeing the wealthy get wealthier i have concerns in the long term for this country if they don t believe in the country they re not going to vote anymore it goes from income inequality to political inequality and that we re run by essentially wealthy oligarch so what do you do what do you say to the people who feel that the system is not working for them well the point you make that it is very natural for people to say the economy is rigged and our political system is rigged and to be almost angry that donald trump gets elected on a platform of draining the swamp and then what do you see the swamp has never been murkier overflowing he criticized the banks and then he brings in a rash of the worst bankers that you could ve imagined there is real grounds for the discontent there s only one way to respond to that and to say we are still a democracy we are a distorted democracy there s voter suppression we have gerrymandering we have money driven politics we ve legalized it but we still have a system where if enough people go out to vote they can change our elected officials and they can change the laws and we can change the laws to curb not eliminate but curb the influence of money in our politics we can change the laws to curb the influence of money in our economy corporate power one of the things that happened 100 and some years ago was we were at a moment where inequality was soaring it was called the gilded age and we had companies like standard oil monopolies and we passed laws it was called the progressive era and part of the reason of the choice of progressive capitalism is an echo back to that progressive era we passed antitrust laws the sherman antitrust law the clayton act a series of laws the intent of which was to curb the monopoly power and it worked we broke up standard oil we broke up other monopolies but then in the period of the 60s 70s a doctrine began to grow and that doctrine is that markets are naturally competitive we even forgot the reason that we passed this legislation bipartisan by the way was not just economics it was politics there was a worry that we were going to lose our democratic politics democratic in the sense that we were going to become overrun by a country of oligarchs politicrats so it was more than just a little bit of economic efficiency it was about the very fiber of our democracy and the chicago economist did two things one they narrowed the scope to say let s just look at economics and then let s pretend that the economy is naturally competitive so most of the time when you see something that looks anti competitive it s just the wonders of the market working themselves out and you sort of have to look at the glory of this wonderful artifice that we created what we ve now discovered is that most of those things that looked like they were anti competitive guess what they were they weren t competitive that s it and we now have an economy where we have large pockets of market domination not only in the things you see every day the internet telephone airlines drugs and so forth but even in little things like pet food and drug stores you can have multiple drug stores with different names all with the same ownership so you don t even know that you re facing this kind of market power why should the average person be concerned by this concentration of power in the handful of a smaller and smaller number of corporations in terms of their powers and also in terms of the price that we ultimately pay for these products what happens when you have market power you use it and increasingly abuse it so you raise prices to the level you can get away with in the case there s a big distinction here between the united states and europe in the united states we have a doctrine that says if you ve legitimately acquired your monopoly power your market power for instance a company buys the right to produce a drug you can raise your prices 1 000 percent no matter how important the drug is that people will die as a result we don t balance any of that we just say if you have a legitimately acquired market power use it in europe there s a doctrine called abuse of dominant power abuse of market power so the kinds of things that we ve seen in the united states with drug prices going up 1 000 percent doesn t happen in europe because they say that s abusive talking about prescription drug prices my mom is older she s on prescription drugs and the prices they keep going up i heard so many stories of others and i ve talked to countless people who are elected officials who spoke to seniors who have said i have to decide whether i m going to eat literally have dinner or not just to pay for my drugs because they keep going up in prices do we need the government to step in and put a caps on this well the basic point that i m trying to focus on here is we have to have a real focus on abuse of market power when facebook takes away your privacy rights it s because it has market power and germany is taking action to try to curb that kind of abuse of market power when you go and sign up for a credit card or a telephone company or a relative has to go into a nursing home you sign a contract usually in that contract you sign away your right to use public courts to adjudicate disputes and disputes will arise sure through arbitrations what you do is you go to arbitration arbitrators are appointed by the companies and these arbitrators work for the companies so that s an example of market power which you don t even think about when you sign the contract but you have a dispute and you will think about it the supreme court has basically come down on the side of corporations they have said you should have read that fine print as if you read that fine print you wouldn t have time to do any work and they re not going to change it anyway they re going to tell you this is our standard clause take it or leave it and your grandma or mom doesn t go the nursing home and you re like all right i ll sign it exactly or you go to the other internet company and what do you find same exact language so what good does it do all hope is not lost here though in your book you have a chapter on a decent life for all i wish you called it a wonderful life for all but i understand the decent part is in there you talk about public options and not just a health care public option but in various areas how can a public option be helpful for people to get health care at less cost that s still good for them and it s still accessible one of the things that we should have anticipated and we ve seen now in the last several years is that there are in many parts of the country only one two or three health insurance companies some places zero are limiting people s choice you asked me before what happens when there is limited choice and then you have high market power what do people do with market power raise prices the notion of a public option is you would have a government program increasing people s choice and the public isn t trying to rip off just trying to break even and provide services that people want so the very existence of this public option would give people more choice but also curb the monopoly power of the private sector it would lead to lower prices in the private sector better than regulation in some ways because it s giving somebody a choice and making them think how do i create alternatives that are preferable to what the government is providing to me it will actually encourage innovation as well as lower prices the public option if it s run by the government let s say it s a health care plan where the ceo s not making 15 million and not sponsoring a stadium for the new york mets to play at their money is focused and it s much more limited in what they re going to use they re not driven for profits or stock buybacks or driving up stock prices and they re not spending money what i call cream skimming trying to find out who are the lowest risk people and getting rid of the high risk people and saying that s their problem based on your experience should 2020 democrats be talking more about public option as opposed to medicare for all that s my preference i think the public option you might say is a more conservative approach but i think it is an approach that ensures health care for everybody but enriches choice the broad idea of a public option is something i think we ought to be exploring in other areas like in retirement go ahead tell us about retirement in retirement we know how the private financial sector has focused on how it can exploit ordinary individuals we had a big fight during the obama administration he proposed that those who sell financial products to older people should be subjected to a fiduciary standard that just means that when you sell a product you should think about the interest of the person to whom you re selling the product and the financial companies said no no no no we can only survive if we are allowed to exploit our conflicts of interest pursue our interest over that of the client to me that was unimaginable we need to be predatory right we need to be predatory it s remarkable so the public option is to say we have a good retirement insurance program called social security it provides a kind of annuity that no private sector provides that guarantees against inflation not a problem now but who knows in the future the idea here is that if you want to make a larger contribution to social security you can do that and that would increase your retirement benefits commensurately that s a public option no salesman you just go on and you make your additional contribution and you get additional benefits very simple low cost and they re practical no new bureaucracy and the public social security program s administrative costs are minuscule compared to private annuities at the end of your book you have a chapter on reclaiming america and you were pretty optimistic but at the same time you warn us about the dark history of authoritarianism when you see what donald trump is doing on a daily basis literally today before we came one here and tomorrow and the day after he ll continue to attack our checks and balances our institutions and now stonewalling congress to the point where he truly wants to be a king how are you still as hopeful is he a cautionary tale that we can be hopeful but we better be alert to history and what this man could become very much so in particular i make some reference to the book to what happened in the 30s the parallel between what has been happening in the united states in the 30s is a little bit more than a little bit unnerving basically the nazis never won a majority of votes they seized control by giving a minority very similar to the minority that are the core trump supporters joined with the business community that said well we ll keep his excesses under control but it will be very convenient for us to be good for business in just the way so many of the business community have said we ll overlook trump s flaws his undermining our democracy his weakening of our systems of checks and balances we ll even ignore the fact that even though our historically we ve been for globalization and the fact that he s for protection we ll even look the other way on that if we can just get a tax bill that gives a tax cut for corporations a tax cut for the billionaires even if a majority of americans in the middle have to pay a higher tax rate let s grab it and if we can get a deregulation to our finance sector maybe an opportunity for another grant prices like 2008 they don t talk about it that way but remember i was at a dinner with one of his people and he was talking about enthusiasm of the deregulation and somebody said didn t we have a crisis in 2008 and wasn t that caused by the excesses of the banks you know that was ancient history and you talk about environmental regulation we re headed for a crisis we need to accelerate our efforts and he s trying to roll them back it certainly is a wake up call like you i m optimistic i think our history allows us to be optimistic in this country but at the same time we must be aware of world history and where this can go and thankfully for those people who were engaged in 2018 we won the house of representatives we also flipped seven governorships and that showed if we come out big we can correct things that are going in the wrong way this is not the time for timidity thank you joseph thank you

comp sales including an impressive 3 5 at outback in addition adjusted operating margins grew 70 basis points year over year on a comparable basis our strong first quarter results reflect the continued focus on core execution in the restaurant and ongoing monetization of the strategic investments made over the past three years we are well positioned to achieve our 2019 financial objectives i want to thank the over 90 000 team members in the field who bring to life the hospitality service and experience that make our restaurants so successful i would also like to thank my colleagues in the restaurant support center who provide great service to our partners your enthusiasm and dedication to always putting the customer first is making a difference each and every day as discussed at investor day our no 1 priority remains driving healthy profitable sales growth across the portfolio over the past three years we invested over 50 million back into the customer experience at the same time we pursued incremental levers to accelerate growth across the digital loyalty off premise and international importantly each of these key platforms are contributing to our sustained success and continued ability to take market share first the investments to fortify the core experience were prioritized toward customer facing improvements this included 30 million in food quality portion enhancements and reduced complexity and 20 million in service training and labor in addition we invested over 400 million in remodels to contemporize our brand and improve curb appeal customers have taken notice as we have seen strengthening brand health measures second the off premise business continues to perform very well delivery is now available in over 550 locations across outback and carrabba s as of the end of q1 these locations are exceeding benchmarks against several key metrics including delivery time and we are pleased with the pace of the delivery ramp up importantly this business is profitable now that the business is reaching scale we will begin augmenting existing local marketing efforts with additional tactics to drive awareness we remain very excited about the incremental opportunity it represents as we capitalize on the growing consumer demand for enjoying restaurant meals at home third the successful dine rewards loyalty program now has over 8 5 million members the program is driving strong engagement across the portfolio we are leveraging the risk data we have collected over the years to enhance the customer segmentation opportunities our investments in it and crm enable more customer centric communications such as dine rewards member only invitations to theme dinners like carrabba s carnevale event this reallocation of marketing spend toward more digital provides a higher roi while reducing overall advertising spend lastly the international business continues to exceed expectations especially in brazil comp sales were up 3 7 with significant margin expansion we enjoy high brand regard and consumer engagement the market is still under penetrated and we have a potential to build another 50 outbacks for a total of 150 outbacks in brazil new restaurants continue to generate among the highest returns in the portfolio providing increased confidence in the plan in addition we have two emerging opportunities in brazil the first is abbraccio with growing sales and economics we currently have 12 locations and believe there s a potential for at least 50 locations the second is the rapidly growing delivery business we have a great local partner and currently have delivery in 12 locations with the opportunity to add many more a large incremental sales opportunity exists with delivery and customer feedback is extremely high these investments in key platforms help fortify the core business and expand our reach to new and existing customers we will continue to leverage our scale portfolio of brands and data analytics to enhance engagement and drive increased profitability we are clearly going to become an even better and more efficient restaurant company this starts by growing sales through the levers we just discussed and tightly managing costs while monetizing our investments we are already seeing the benefit of this focus as adjusted operating margins expanded by 70 basis points on a comparable basis in the first quarter now turning to outback outback comp sales were up 3 5 in the first quarter on top of an already strong 4 3 increase in q1 2018 this is outback s ninth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales we are benefiting from the ongoing returns from the investments in customer experience in addition we are seeing success with enhancements to the service model to strengthen customer engagement service represents a key priority and differentiator for the brand as outback remains focused on creating memorable dining experiences for its consumers every day we remain committed to refreshing our assets outback is testing multiple interior remodel prototypes the new designs modernize the look while expanding the off premise room to handle the higher expected order volume we are also relocating outback restaurants as quickly as quality sites become available this relocation program continues to deliver impressive results and recent relocations are generating sales lifts in excess of 30 outback remains well positioned to take further market share chris will provide more detail on the quarterly sales performance at carrabba s bonefish and fleming s in a moment but let me briefly summarize what we are trying to accomplish across these brands no 1 invest behind and simplify operations to enhance the core guest experience two offer unique and brand appropriate programs such as wine dinners at carrabba s to drive frequency three continue to opportunistically remove unprofitable discounting and invest in our people to continue to lower turnover and increase engagement importantly every brand posted positive comp sales and experienced margin expansion in the first quarter in summary the first quarter was an excellent start to the year we are excited about the prospects ahead and look forward to updating you as the year progresses and with that i ll turn the call over to chris meyer to provide more detail on q1 chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks dave and good morning everyone i ll kick off with discussion around our sales and profit performance for the quarter i d like to remind everyone that when i speak to results i ll be referring to adjusted numbers that exclude certain costs and benefits please see the earnings release for reconciliations between non gaap metrics and the most directly comparable u s gaap measures we also provided a discussion of the nature of each adjustment with that in mind our first quarter financial results versus the prior year were as follows gaap diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 69 versus 0 68 in 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 75 versus 0 71 last year when evaluating our results it is important to keep in mind that our 0 71 from q1 2018 included a 0 03 benefit for the amortization of deferred gains from our sale leaseback transactions upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard we no longer recognize these deferred gains in our financial statements if you exclude this 0 03 impact of the new lease accounting standard from our q1 2018 results our adjusted eps would have been 0 68 on that basis our q1 2019 adjusted eps grew 10 from 0 68 last year to 0 75 in 2019 this growth is in line with our full year guidance the primary difference between our first quarter gaap and adjusted eps is related to certain restructuring relocation and restaurant closing costs excluded from the 2019 and 2018 first quarter results total revenues increased 1 to 1 1 billion in the first quarter and u s comp sales were up 2 4 in line with our full year guidance of 2 to 2 5 this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales for the combined u s portfolio u s traffic was down 90 basis points this was a little lower than expected due to an estimated 30 basis points of unfavorable weather a larger reduction in discounts than originally planned at outback and pockets of category softness in florida and texas where we index high we do not expect this regional softness to continue in the back half of the year in addition keep in mind that outback s q1 2018 traffic of 2 2 was the highest we posted all last year given this and the many levers dave discussed we remain confident in our ability to grow traffic in 2019 on a combined u s portfolio basis as it relates to our concepts outback comps were up 3 5 this is outback s ninth consecutive quarter of positive comp sales we continue to benefit from the ongoing monetization of our investments in food quality and portion enhancements in addition improved rois in our marketing programs and the growth of our loyalty platform allowed us to opportunistically reduce traditional discounting in q1 by 17 relative to last year this benefit showed up in increased check average finally our delivery rollout continues to go smoothly and we are seeing growth against several key metrics carrabba s comp sales were up 30 basis points we are seeing growth in our off premise business through catering delivery and our family bundle take home meals we also continue to focus on operational simplification as well as proprietary programs such as amore monday to drive dinner traffic bonefish grill comps were up 1 9 driven by the success of our ocean mixed grill and 3 course lobster dinner promotions these differentiated offerings helped both traffic as well as check average in q1 in the fourth quarter of last year we made the decision at bonefish to reduce the number of gift cards sold through discount channels some of these channels charge higher fees and it made financial sense to reduce our reliance on these types of discounts this reduction negatively impacted q1 traffic by an estimated 150 basis points since most holiday gift cards are redeemed in the first quarter this change did have a positive impact on profitability and margins that being said we are excited about the future growth potential of bonefish grill as we continue to revitalize this strong lifestyle brand comp sales at fleming s were up 60 basis points of all of our brands fleming s was the most impacted by unfavorable weather which we estimated lowered their q1 comp sales by 110 basis points in addition as we have discussed previously in q2 of 2018 we made the conscious decision at fleming s to move away from legacy value offerings such as our 567 bar menu while these actions have a short term negative impact on traffic they have had a positive impact on check average and profitability comp sales in brazil were up 3 7 we were pleased with this result and as a reminder brazil has had positive comp sales since the acquisition aside from two quarters where we faced unprecedented economic and political turmoil this business has strong consumer appeal and is well positioned for growth as the country emerges from the political and economic challenges faced in 2018 adjusted operating income margin was 7 8 in q1 this was up an impressive 70 basis points after adjusting 2018 for the impact of the lease accounting change there are a few key drivers of this improvement in operating margin first our 2 4 combined u s sales comp was driven by improved check average and fewer discounts second our margins benefited significantly from ongoing productivity efforts particularly in the area of food waste third we continue to find efficiencies on our marketing spend as we pivot away from mass marketing to higher roi digital spend finally in our international segment adjusted operating margins went from 8 7 in q1 of 2018 to 12 3 in q1 of 2019 an improvement of 360 basis points year over year our brazil business continues to perform at a high level and as we grow this market it will have increased visibility in our consolidated bloomin brands margins overall this was a very strong start to the year in demonstrating our ability to grow margins as we indicated at investor day the quarterly contribution of each of our levers may vary but they will all play a key role in closing the margin gap to our peers moving to tax our q1 adjusted tax rate was approximately 8 this was in line with our expectations on the development front we opened six systemwide locations in the first quarter including five international locations and one domestic outback location finally we are reconfirming all aspects of our guidance including our expectations for comp sales margin growth and eps for the year in summary q1 was a solid start to the year for bloomin brands we had healthy sales growth and strong management of our restaurant expenses has led to significant margin improvement in the quarter our strong start has positioned us well to deliver on our 2019 objectives and with that we will now open up the call for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of jeffrey bernstein with barclays please proceed with your question jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst great thank you very much two things one just on the comp outlook i mean it looks like from a growth perspective 2019 you re still expecting positive traffic across the portfolio yet they seem to be down in terms of traffic in the first quarter so on the flip side the average check was as you mentioned up significantly at the outbacks i m just wondering if you could talk about the balance of why you expect maybe the traffic to improve and or maybe the average check to ease as we think about outback and the broader portfolio through the year and then i had one follow up dave deno chief executive officer sure thanks jeff i m happy to see the sales we had in the first quarter the comps were above the industry average as was traffic and as chris mentioned although the traffic was a little bit lighter than we expected but we re quite pleased with what the quarter turned in and also what the rest of the year looks like so let me just talk about the quarter and then we can talk about the i can talk about the balance of the year and chris can turn to guest check average first of all outback comped year over year at 2 2 positive traffic benefit in q1 so that was something to consider we had about 30 basis points of unfavorable weather in q1 results and we did see pockets of category softness in florida and texas where we do have a lot of restaurants we expect this mainly due to the bounce back from the hurricane last year so we don t expect the traffic trends in florida and texas to be a challenge in the balance of the year in fact we expect the results to improve and then finally as chris mentioned in his remarks discounts at outback were down 17 in q1 as we moved away from some things that we ve always been looking at and bonefish did some stuff with their gift cards through a discount channel that we thought would be better off somewhere else and we didn t want to go through that discount channel now as it relates to the balance of the year first of all our ongoing benefits from our investments in customer experience are really paying off in brand health measures and other things and that s in food and service second we ve got the off premise business that we ve worked so hard to build and we re so happy to have our channel third we talked about our loyalty program that has 8 5 million members we re learning more and more about marketing each and every day on the digital side and what we can do there and increasing return on investment and also managing our spending and lastly we ve got our relocation and remodel programs so jeff as we look at the balance of the year these are the levers that we re going to continue to use as we go forward so i ll turn it over to chris now to talk about ppa chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and as it relates to check average jeff i think that we would anticipate check average to ease as the year progresses as we stated at investor day we expect to be very prudent in our thoughts around menu pricing moving forward so we would expect pricing to ratchet down as the year progresses and concurrent with that as dave mentioned we would expect traffic to start to ratchet up so it s all within the context of our 2 to 2 5 sales guidance that we gave out for the year jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst gotcha and then my one other clarification or question i know you reiterated all key components of guidance for 19 just specific to the commodity outlook i think it was a 2 basket wondering if you could talk a little bit about this in terms of whatever you re willing to share in terms of percent locked and whether that s up or down it seems that there s been a lot more talk lately about pressure potentially from african swine fever i m just wondering how you guys are positioned and where you think the commodity basket will play out as we move through the year chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no jeff we re in pretty good shape as it relates to beef for this year our overall commodity basket i m not going to give specific to beef but our overall commodity basket is actually a bit more locked at this point in time than it was last year at this point in time for us as we look at commodity headwinds i think that seafood has been the biggest driver of our inflation this year jeffrey bernstein barclays analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jeff farmer with gordon haskett please proceed with your question jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst thank you at the analyst day you pointed to 50 direct delivery units that have already seen off premise exceed i think it was 20 of sales mix so just curious what are the common characteristics of those units that have delivered that outsized off premise sales mix growth do you guys think that there s opportunities to see a large part of the system delivery at a similar level of off premise sales mix dave deno chief executive officer yes the main thing of anything on delivery is obviously the trade area is important but the talent engagement and operations of the restaurant partner is so important and we see restaurants that have incredible dine in business also do an absolutely incredible delivery business and i just want to say thanks to the restaurant partners out there that have really done a fantastic job on delivery for us as we built the system and they re just doing a great job and we re going to see more and more of these number of restaurants achieving these sales levels i m not going to get into each one and how quickly and things like that but it s just been so gratifying to see people get after this and look at our off premise opportunity both from a carryout and a delivery standpoint so jeff it s the common element is just the talent and leadership of our managing partners out there jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst and then just as a follow up i d like to drill down on that margin opportunity a little bit more so going back to at least 2012 the ipo bloomin has been guiding this 50 million in annual cost savings i know there s a lot of moving pieces there but as you look forward to 19 20 21 what are still some of the lower hanging opportunities you see in terms of pursuing cost savings moving forward chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so we still in q1 we did really well with our food waste opportunity we also saw benefits on our distribution network energy r m dwl so it s pretty wide ranging we still have runway left over the next few years as we continue to execute against these opportunities in these areas such as waste and even in labor opportunities remain outside the restaurant with optimizing our supply chain logistics distribution activities we re working on a pipeline of ideas that can serve us well in the future as well such as incorporating technology into our restaurants leveraging high performance kitchens kds systems technology will be a big part of our leverage of productivity in the years to come this year though there are still a lot of low hanging fruit as it relates to opportunities in cost of goods sold and in restaurant operating expenses dave deno chief executive officer and jeff what i like about it is if you look at the capability of our organization to achieve this i ve already talked about the restaurant managing partners doing a great job on this but if you look at a very talented supply chain organization that manages food costs and distribution costs so well the group that the work the technology group is doing we re learning more and more about digital every day and the rois that come from that so i like the capability we have also within our company to achieve these results jeff farmer gordon haskett analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john ivankoe with j p morgan please proceed with your question john ivankoe j p morgan analyst hi first thank you just a clarification there is so many moving pieces in your same store traffic from 2016 to 2018 at the outback brand i just wanted to kind of verify given there is two year and three year comparisons which do vary quite widely especially in 2017 that you do view the first quarter of 19 as having the most difficult traffic comparison and that because of that comparison we should expect an acceleration plus all the other initiatives that you expect to drive sales in that regard dave deno chief executive officer yes john i think if you look at it correct me if i m wrong chris but the first quarter of 2019 had the big chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer 2018 dave deno chief executive officer sorry first quarter of 2018 the quarter we just left has the biggest traffic level john ivankoe j p morgan analyst yes that s true and i asked the question even going back to 2017 that we started the year in 2017 with traffic of down 2 1 and ended the year in the fourth quarter 17 with traffic about 4 3 so there is that very very we saw this major acceleration in traffic in 2017 some of that was actually explained by 2016 that in other words this is more than just a one year phenomenon and i m just asking that we re thinking about those two year and three year trends now i suppose kind of acknowledging those in the future dave deno chief executive officer yes we absolutely look at our trends but more importantly john we look at what we re doing in our restaurants right we look at the service that gregg scarlett and team his under his leadership at outback what we re doing on food and service and what s all the hip great things they re doing there and the different levers that we talked about be it delivery be it loyalty be it the remodels etc yes of course we look at the trends but also we what s very important is what we re doing for ourselves with our brand in our restaurants as we continue to grow that business john ivankoe j p morgan analyst ok great that s what i was hoping to hear just a couple more if i may are there any tactical changes that we might expect with the dine rewards program obviously there s a pretty considerable benefit that the consumer gets and there might even be some arbitrage that exists between brands of you re kind of earning points at one and redeeming at another i mean are there any changes that you see that could potentially optimize either one kind of the customer response to the program or secondly the profitability from this program dave deno chief executive officer sure with 8 5 million members we re really pleased with where we re at all brands are participating we really like what each brands are seeing the return on investment is there and growing of course we ll always look at how we can make the program better for our customers for our company and everything else but we don t expect any major changes to it but we ll always be looking at how we can make it better and better and better and we think it s one of the best programs in all of the restaurant business so each brand is participating return on investment is improving and we really look forward to now really using that database we have that s what people forget we have a database that we can use to help market to our key customers so that s a big part of this john ivankoe j p morgan analyst and then a final one i mean and this is from the analyst day i mean i think you guys discussed a dine in average ticket of 54 but a delivery ticket of 42 if i m remembering that correctly with most of that gap being beverages which is obviously a very very high margin ticket i mean is there anything that you can do that could kind of shrink that gap and that loss of profit from beverage sales in the delivery transaction versus the dine in transaction to where we don t have to worry about the profitability of those transactions going forward if incrementality over time proves to be a little bit less than what it is today dave deno chief executive officer yes i think john i think first of all you hit it the incrementality piece is important for us and we re seeing the incrementality in that business secondly i think how we market it how we service it using e commerce to help grow that guest check because what we see when people order stuff online as opposed to calling they build the gap check and so as we offer more service better service better marketing we can certainly hope to grow that guest check in delivery chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and one thing i would add john is that one of the advantages of having your own delivery network is that you have the ability to tweak the operating model as you see fit and we can make changes that can enhance profit ability enhance the experience for our guests that is one of the advantages we have with having our own drivers john ivankoe j p morgan analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john glass with morgan stanley please proceed with your question john glass morgan stanley analyst thanks very much and good morning dave deno chief executive officer good morning john glass morgan stanley analyst can you just drill down a little on the restaurant level operating margin improvement this quarter a lot of it came from the other operating expense line and if i look from last year i think that s even where you got some of the sales leaseback benefits so i think the improvement there is even more pronounced is that a function primarily of reduction in advertising and can you just help us quantify this it sounded like this quarter in particular you removed some advertising and maybe that was or discount i don t know if that s reflected in the advertising line or not could you help us understand what are the drivers for that improvement i mean if it s a reduction in say media spend how much that may have been chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i ll give you the broader context and then i ll specifically go into restaurant operating expenses so if you think about broadly our improvement in restaurant margin we have always said the most important component of this margin journey is sales growth so the 2 4 combined u s comp sales was a key driver of margin expansion and that did have an impact on restaurant operating expenses and i would say that s the largest contributor to that line item specifically secondly we have we do have success with our productivity initiatives in the areas of food waste but i also mentioned areas like energy and utilities things like that so that impacted restaurant operating expenses as well and then finally as it relates to the u s business there was that shift in more dollars to digital marketing so we did see efficiencies in our overall marketing expenses so and that was probably 20 to 30 basis points of the improvement in the restaurant operating expense line hopefully that gives you a little more context dave deno chief executive officer yes and i think too john as we look at it this is that s a really important point because as we look at return on investment on those advertising dollars it doesn t necessarily mean that the advertising piece we re cutting advertising we re going to manage advertising we see great ideas and great roi we re going to continue to manage that line item so it will and as chris mentioned in his remarks each of these line items will have an impact on our restaurant profitability let me just add one more thing because i think it gets overlooked when we talk about margins and that is the remarkable performance in brazil this quarter i mean you saw our international segment up significantly in margins and that plays that comes into our consolidated results and played a piece in it so when you see sales growth like that margin growth significant margin growth and our new units going up that are so successful i just want to highlight that business one last time it is part of the margin story john glass morgan stanley analyst that s very helpful and can you kind of maybe some metrics on the off premise and total growth this quarter what the growth of the off premise business was what the contribution the percentage of sales and the growth there so we can just understand what contribution that has to the total comp growth dave deno chief executive officer sure so if you look i ll talk to what the impact is to outback and carrabba s because fleming s and bonefish have a relatively small business when it comes to off premise but it was 14 of our business and that s the total off premise which is carryout and delivery it s 14 of our business in q1 and 19 growth in carrabba s and outback ok chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes just to be clear when we say 14 that s 14 of the total business of outback and carrabba s dave deno chief executive officer right john glass morgan stanley analyst ok and you did close some express units this quarter i think and you those are relatively recent openings is that a shift in how you think about how you want to approach off premise or what was the rationale behind that if that is correct that you closed them dave deno chief executive officer yes no those are r d labs so we still have some that are open they are doing well and we re going to continue to work that business hard because we think it is part of our portfolio but as we do these experimental r d type restaurants we ll have openings and closures and stuff and i m just glad to be the leader of a company that s so agile and willing to do these things and we ll continue to work on these opportunities john glass morgan stanley analyst ok thank you operator our next question comes from the line of andrew strelzik with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning so i was wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on the international margin expansion most of the dynamics that you called out some were u s centric so i m wondering what specifically was driving it on the international side it seems like given the magnitude it has to be more than comps and importantly as you re going to be lapping bigger margin declines over the next couple of quarters from last year and kind of softer operating performance on the top line as well is this kind of a repeatable type of margin expansion in the international segment for the next couple of quarters dave deno chief executive officer are we so that question was specifically around international right andrew andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst correct dave deno chief executive officer ok so brazil has the same opportunities in productivity and management that our u s business has and pierre and his team have just done a great job pursuing that so when you take the volumes that they have and you layer on sales growth like chris said earlier sales growth is first and foremost in margin expansion and we ll never lose sight of that but that doesn t mean we don t manage our expenses and pursue our opportunities so pierre has taken opportunities in food costs he did a fantastic job managing labor down there and in other parts of his p l and the other thing that is exciting about brazil we talked a lot about delivery here in the u s brazil was also pursuing their delivery opportunity they re doing it with a third party because we re still mall based there and the third party has good access to malls and things but they re really doing a fantastic job on taking that opportunity in brazil so i think we can certainly see continued margin improvement in brazil and see the sales that we have and we really enjoy and chris mentioned it in his opening remarks we bought the business in 2013 we ve had positive same store sales growth in that business every quarter except for the two that had some economic and political turmoil associated with it but that s the power of that business down there and the opportunity that represents in both sales and margin expansion andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst great and one other one if i could with the growth of the off premise business and maybe more group orders and things like that i know you called out some of the traffic dynamics this quarter at outback but i guess i m just wondering is there another maybe internal metric that you look at that might better judge what the number of customers that you re really serving where traffic might be understating that dave deno chief executive officer i ll try to i think i understand the question if i missed it let me know but we do look at the different types of delivery out there by restaurant so we have catering and we look at that mix which is really a great opportunity especially at carrabba s italian grill we look at that opportunity a large part is catering we look at the number of deliveries we look at our off premise business so we can segment it quite well by restaurant to understand where the opportunities are within our company and believe me we re pursuing them chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer and by channel right as well dave deno chief executive officer yes sure chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer and by channel meaning whether we do an online order they call in orders so there s a lot of different metrics we look at andrew strelzik bmo capital markets analyst ok great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian vaccaro with raymond james please proceed with your question brian vaccaro raymond james analyst thanks and good morning just a quick follow up on the other opex line this quarter i m curious was the component of the year on year leverage that you saw related to lapping investments or outsized other cost inflation that might have occurred in the first quarter last year and are there any lumpy comparison that we should just be mindful of as we think about q2 through q4 chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer nothing that jumps out at me brian in terms of lumpy comparisons moving forward restaurant operating expense line like i said in q1 had a lot to do with average unit volume appreciation initiatives in the productivity line and in the marketing line as well everything else is kind of cats and mice and there s not a whole lot of other things to talk about there was obviously some inflation but it was pretty minimal most of our inflation is isolated to the cost of goods sold and the labor line brian vaccaro raymond james analyst ok and thinking about the q1 comps and i guess outback specifically you mentioned weather a 30 bps bad guy but were there also any calendar shifts worth noting whether it be new year s eve or the easter and spring break shifts so anything worth calling out there chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes absolutely so weather was 30 basis points holiday shift was positive 20 basis points for us but there were two components to that right so we had the new year s eve shift at the beginning of the year that was favorable to us and then you had easter toward the back end of the quarter that was slightly unfavorable the net of those two things was a positive 20 basis points so all in all between weather and between holiday it was pretty pretty immaterial i guess the holiday shift we kind of knew about coming into the quarter the weather we didn t know dave deno chief executive officer and the other thing brian i just want to add and chris talked about earlier was we made a really good conscious decision to manage our discounting down a bit at outback and so it was about 100 and that was about 17 down in discounts so it had impact as well on traffic so that was all but it s all planned that was all part of our planning and it s certainly embedded in our guidance brian vaccaro raymond james analyst ok and on the discount topic and thinking about year on year rest of the year how do those comparisons look does that start to normalize in q2 at outback dave deno chief executive officer yes it will at outback it will normalize but we re always we re always going to be looking at how we come to market and things like that but as you followed our story for so long you know that we ve been trying to remove discounting of our portfolio and really focus on other parts of the business but we ll always look at where we stand within the company and making investments behind digital marketing and things like that so and i m not obviously for competitive reasons not going to get into that but we ll continue our path on trying to remove unprofitable discounting growing healthy traffic but we ll always be looking at how we go to market chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think that the improvement that we re seeing in some of the digital spend the rois as they improve it gives us a lot more flexibility to make these kind of decisions brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right that s great and then just last one for me on free cash flow i think 2018 around 80 million if memory serves i think it was suppressed by a few unusual items and timing etc could you walk through a couple of those items for us and then maybe as you think about your 2019 what does your 19 guidance sort of result in from a free cash flow perspective maybe a range on 19 free cash flow chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so as you look at 2018 and 80 million is the right context if you re looking at it from an operating cash flow minus capex perspective i would say that you had the 53rd week dynamic which was huge we did make a pretty opportunistic commodity buy which was north of 30 million at the end of last year so there were some shifts certainly in working capital and one of the tricky things about our year end is because our year end is december 31 and then changes as the year as we work toward another 53rd week you do have this gift card timing we do all these gift card sales right at the end of the year and then when you receive payment can have a huge impact on working capital so those shifts at the end of the year can get a little bit noisy but what i can tell you is moving forward and we did have this context we re not going to give specific cash flow guidance for 2019 however we do expect cash flow to be well in excess of the 100 million that we discussed at analyst day and again we feel really good about all the levers we have to grow margin sales as well as cash flow and i think the most important aspect of the cash flow conversation is that we have sufficient cash flow to meet all of our business needs and we will have excess funds available to return cash to shareholders brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gregory francfort with bank of america please proceed with your question gregory francfort bank of america analyst hey guys thanks for the question the first one was just is there any shift in the timing of easter that impacts your business or spring break holidays and then the second one was as i look at tax rate through the year and i know the full year guidance has been i think at 7 to 8 is that supposed to be relatively steady or would you expect some volatility in that line chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer the tax rate we should we would expect to be fairly steady i would think as the year progresses there s always going to be discrete items within quarters that can make that thing ebb and flow up and down as it relates to easter shift i would say when we call we talked about the holiday shift being positive 20 the new year s eve shift to the beginning of the quarter was probably 40 basis points positive easter was probably 20 basis points negative so those things largely offset but we did see some negative easter impact spring break shift timing q1 is always a little noisy because of those things gregory francfort bank of america analyst and then maybe just one on the discounting what s been the overall customer response i guess you guys see internal metrics that we can t see and what has been the big changes that that s had on your customer either perception or customer behavior just generally in the bloomin business dave deno chief executive officer yes we track brand health measures very carefully they re improving as a direct result of the investments we ve made in service in food and everything else and removing the unprofitable discounting so as we ve gone through this journey every week every month we track it by brand and look at our brand health measures that i think everybody is familiar with i won t mention all those but it s a really important part of our business and will be going forward gregory francfort bank of america analyst thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matthew difrisco with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst thank you my question is with respect to the carrabba s refranchising was there any benefit i can t necessarily pull that out of the income statement in your earnings or your ebitda and then also a follow up to that i m just curious is this is there opportunity for both the bonefish brand or carrabba s brand domestically to potentially refranchise more of some of the lower margin market that could also help aid your aggregate corporate margins dave deno chief executive officer yes it we had refranchising was de minimis on our financials there s not much there at all it is more about how we go to market in certain periods and also we really have a great franchise partner i mean the guy is remarkable that bought these restaurants we know him well he s going to do a fantastic job and so we ll always look as we talked in the past matt we ll always be looking at how we go to market around the u s but we see our core competency as owning and operating restaurants it doesn t mean that we won t refranchise here and there and look at things it won t mean that we ll maybe expand more bonefish into certain key areas as company owned and things we ll be looking at all of those things as we go forward but we want to make sure that we bring the brands to market to our best ability and also the best possible return for our shareholders and that s the kind of work that we re try and do each quarter matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst has the benefit though i know you said it s not that large but is it in the g a line if you could just quantify if there was a benefit to that chris meyer executive vice president and chief financial officer there wasn t any benefit this quarter and frankly it s only a handful of restaurants and it s a small amount dave deno chief executive officer yes it s a small amount matthew difrisco guggenheim securities analyst all right guys thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jon tower with wells fargo please proceed with your question jon tower wells fargo securities analyst hey thanks so you ve been pulling back on unprofitable discounting across the portfolio for a few years now and it has resulted in a bit of traffic headwind across the business but and it s also been in the context of the best casual dining environment in well over three years now so can you talk about how you plan to use this discounting lever in future periods particularly if and when the overall industry slows down dave deno chief executive officer well jon if we look at how we re running our company it s clearly we will invest in the customer experience and become an even better restaurant operating company that s the first and foremost thing we can do in becoming a more efficient company as well so we re going to start there then when you look at we have a really good sense of our discounting and our advertising investments and what kind of returns we get on those and so as the casual dining market fluctuates up and down we ll be able to make some decisions as to what we want to do and we have a great deal of knowledge on that i m just glad that we ve gone on this journey over the last couple of years to attack unprofitable discounting and to reinvest in the customer experience for competitive reasons i m not going to get into what our future plans look like but i can assure you that we have a really good pulse of what the customer is doing what it means for advertising what we do for our promotions as we go forward operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to dave deno for closing remarks dave deno chief executive officer well we appreciate everybody joining us today we look forward to talking about our company in july on our second quarter earnings release and i hope in the meantime everybody has a chance to visit our restaurants where you re going to get some great food and service i want to thank everybody again for being on the call have a great day operator duration 47

find out where the federal government uses tax revenue paying taxes is no fun and with tax season just having ended there are millions of people who just sent more money to the irs than they really wanted to pay if you ve just written a big check to the federal government you might be curious about where your hard earned money will go each year the federal government gives the general public an idea of how it spends the tax revenue it brings in with spending coming up to just shy of 4 trillion in the most recent year for which government data is available the money that you and millions just sent to the treasury go toward meeting a large number of different purposes the math of government budgets in the federal government s 2017 fiscal year the total amount collected in taxes amounted to 3 32 trillion that was well shy of the 3 98 trillion that the government spent that year leaving the treasury to borrow money to come up with the 665 billion difference the biggest share of that money came from individual taxpayers with 40 coming from personal income taxes and another 29 coming from the social security medicare unemployment and other taxes that are typically collected through payroll withholding borrowing to cover the deficit amounted to 17 of total spending as you can see below the government spent that money primarily in three key areas with five out of every six dollars falling into these categories the biggest category is social security medicare and other retirement programs the federal government provides these programs to help give income support to retired workers and the disabled as well as offering medical care primarily to the elderly with more than 60 million people receiving social security and nearly all of those 65 or older qualifying to receive medicare coverage it comes as no surprise that the federal government spends two fifths of its budget supporting these programs social programs represent the second largest category of federal government spending the best known programs that fall under this category are the medicaid program for providing healthcare for low income americans and the supplemental nutrition assistance program that allows those with few financial resources to obtain money for buying food the supplemental security income program administered by the social security administration also falls under this category because of its need based guidelines and other similar programs provide temporary financial assistance to needy families and meet other social needs a small portion of this money goes toward health research and public health programs along with providing assisted housing unemployment compensation and other social services finally the third biggest expenditure goes to national defense this includes not only the money needed to pay military salaries and buy or upgrade military equipment but also funding for veterans benefits and services in addition military and economic assistance to foreign countries also falls into this category along with the expense of maintaining overseas embassies the remaining 16 or so of the budget gets divvied up across a wider range of programs about half goes to areas like agriculture natural resources environment transportation education job training science bank insurance commerce and housing credits and community development activities interest on the national debt requires 6 of total expenditures leaving 2 for general government needs future challenges ahead what s particularly concerning is that there s reason to believe that the stress on the federal budget will become even more pronounced in future years a host of factors will contribute to that trend the retirement of the baby boomer generation will lead to increased benefit payments for social security and medicare that could drain their respective trust funds higher interest rates could lead to a big increase in the amount of money needed to pay interest on the national debt healthcare expenses have risen at a faster pace than overall inflation for years and if that trend continues it ll put medicare and medicaid into further difficulty as a taxpayer you don t have any direct say in how the federal government spends the taxes you pay but the more you know about government expenditures the easier it ll be to use your rights as an american to seek out tax policies that make sense for you and the public at large

when hawke took the prime ministership labour s share of income was more than 60 per cent of gdp according to the reserve bank analysis and today it s under 55 per cent shorten is right and the profits share of income has risen from about 30 per cent to 38 loading wages growth is weak indeed shorten wants the may 18 election to be a referendum on wages the labor leader s stump speech refrain everything is going up except wages and again shorten s version of reality is supported by the reserve bank the most impartial of australia s arbiters the central bank s governor philip lowe has gone so far as to say that there is something deep and underlying going on with low wages growth in a revolutionary remark for a reserve bank chief lowe said that if workers were to ask their bosses for a pay rise that would be a good thing wages growth under the liberals shorten says is north of 2 per cent under labor it s north of 3 per cent not that he s actually promising to restore annual wages growth of above 3 per cent if he should win but he s certainly going to try for it he s careful not to enter the realm of populist fantasy the fantasy of offering unworkably simple answers to complex questions we won t pass a law to mandate a uniform 3 per cent wage rise he promises sensible reforms in consultation with business prime minister scott morrison visits the ausproof manufacturing facility in gladstone on friday credit aap he s committed a shorten labor government to overrule the fair work commission s cut to penalty rates for the hospitality sector he s offering to mount a vigorous government case for a substantial rise in the minimum wage in front of the fair work commission he would consider increasing the negotiating power of low wage workers in specific feminised sectors such as childcare how by allowing a return to pattern bargaining in place of enterprise bargaining and he is unabashed in promising a more heavily redistributive tax system capital is taxed too lightly shorten says and income is taxed too heavily we have an intergenerational scheme that disadvantages young people he says taxing income from work more heavily than property investment for instance by curbing negative gearing we are going to start taking that away and the opposition leader gets quite worked up on the tax concession currently paid to some self funded retirees we have a tax system that gives you free money if you own shares and you don t pay any tax he says in arguing for his plan to abolish cash refunds for dividend imputation i would rather spend revenue on health care on aged care on child care than spend it on property investors and tax subsidies he has pledged to cut taxes on lower incomes but to increase tax on workers in the top bracket the top marginal tax rate for people earning over 180 000 would rise from 47 per cent to 49 but despite the pernicious whispering campaign of disinformation labor does not plan to introduce inheritance taxes or death taxes by cautiously tipping the balance from profits towards wages by redistributing the tax burden from low income workers onto selected types of capital shorten wants to increase fairness if he can he will be doing australian capitalism a favour capitalism in australia is under question especially if you listen to a dissatisfied younger generation or listen to the strident statements from the actu s sally mcmanus but the problems of unfairness and inequality in australia are nowhere near those of the us or uk loading in many countries satisfaction with capitalism is under challenge in the home of capitalism in the raw the us only 45 per cent of voters under the age of 30 have a positive view of that system according to a gallup poll last year and the percentage with a positive view of socialism fifty one you don t need to listen to self declared socialist bernie sanders to know that there s a problem i m a capitalist says ray dalio the multi billionaire founder of the world s biggest hedge fund and even i think capitalism is broken american capitalism needs to reform or die says the bridgewater chair net worth us17 billion why do you think a raft of american billionaires has been buying doomsday bolt holes in new zealand leaders of industry from silicon valley to wall street are joining the survivalism movement as the new yorker magazine reported the co founder of linkedin venture capitalist reid hoffman estimated that 50 per cent of silicon valley billionaires had bought some level of apocalypse insurance ranging from an underground bunker to an nz farm they fear the consequences of the very system that has allowed them to make their fortunes among other fears revolution is very much on their minds and not only on american minds one of the high priests of the global capitalist system the former governor of the reserve bank of india and former chief economist at the international monetary fund raghuram rajan last month told the bbc i think capitalism is under serious threat because it s stopped providing for the many and when that happens the many revolt against capitalism loading the annual gathering of the fashionable elites at the world economic forum at the swiss ski resort town of davos is supposed to be a good indicator of the mood of the global monied the mood of this year s january forum at davos if a single theme ran through this week it was acceptance that the capitalist system of which the attending elites are the masters is broken said steve levine of the us news site axios and if they don t take charge changes may come that they won t like in australia the former chief executive of the australian stock exchange recently advised business leaders to read the communist manifesto by karl marx and friedrich engels why the struggle between the capitalist class and the proletariat is becoming more relevant today elmer funke kupper informed readers of the australian financial review several of the drivers of discontent in the 1800s echo in 2019 these include a lack of real wage growth concerns about trade and globalisation and a growing sense of inequality
mofg earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 midwestone financial group inc mofg 3 82 q1 2019 earnings call 12 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good afternoon and welcome to the midwestone financial group incorporated first quarter 2019 earnings conference call all participants will be in listen only mode operator instructions after today s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions after today s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions operator instructions please note this event is being recorded i would like to now turn the conference over to charles funk president and ceo please go ahead charles n funk president and chief executive officer thank you jacob and good morning or good afternoon wherever you maybe this morning and thanks for joining us on the call i ll begin with the forward looking statement as always and remind you this presentation contains forward looking statements relating to the financial condition results of operations and business of midwestone financial group inc forward looking statements generally include words such as believes expects anticipates and other similar expressions actual results could differ materially from those indicated among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are interest rates the change in the mix of the company s business competitive pressures general economic conditions and the risk factors detailed in the company s periodic reports and registration statements filed with the sec mofg undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this presentation and with that out of the way i would say that in many ways this was a normal quarter for our company but for three issues that i will discuss that caused us to fall slightly short of our own internal expectations those three issues being the size of our loan loss provision unusually high loan paydowns in the quarter as well as a significant shortfall in our home mortgage center and again i will detail all three of those things in my remarks at the end of the call i ll also cover updated projections for the american trust atbancorp transaction as we have not provided any guidance since last august and we do plan to close this transaction on may 1st so first let s talk for a minute about the balance sheet we showed only modest loan growth during the quarter and we added unusual amount of paydowns more than 20 million in paydowns that were somewhat unexpected and i would note that a small percentage of those paydowns were watch rated credits which is not always a bad thing but we had reasonable loan growth but the paydowns limited the overall loan growth on the balance sheet perhaps more importantly the loan pipeline is still good for the second quarter and this is true throughout our footprint i would say that it s very nice to see very good activity out of the iowa city market which has been flat for a period of time we have a good pipeline there so our guidance on loan growth for this quarter is 1 to 1 5 and we still feel comfortable of the overall year over year projections of 4 to 6 for 2019 denver the twin cities and iowa city all feel confident that their pipelines are good and they will meet their goals for 2019 deposits were unusually strong and hit an all time high briefly for our company but it s fair to say and i think we indicated this in the earnings release we had a large amount of property tax money and public funds in our bank at quarter end a lot of that money has gone but we still are showing modest year over year increases in our deposits the fema on deposits is the same as it s been for more than a year and that is that it s very very cooperative this may have been the most competitive deposit quarter in terms of pricing that we ve seen and we have healthy competition throughout our footprint and the competition is large banks small banks credit unions basically any depository institution is paying up for funds and making life difficult to hold our cost of funds in check and you ll note that our cost of funds was up 12 basis points during the quarter which is historically a lot for us additionally and i m sure that we re not alone in the commercial banking space the flat yield curve really does hurt us we re seeing with the treasury curve trending lower and flatter we re seeing now some pricing for example on five year loans under 5 for high quality deals overall i think we d still be able to originate above 5 on average but it s very very hard to get loan pricing leverage on term deals with the treasury curve like it is or as it is the biggest question i think is if the fed s new stance on basically being on hold is going to filter through to deposit market we have not seen that yet and again i think this was in the earnings release but i will say that the core margin fell 5 basis points from 3 53 to 3 48 and i think that s probably the largest fall we ve had in any one quarter since the fed began to raise rates so we will continue to soldier on but again my main theme is the flat yield curve is difficult in terms of non interest income i ll start with loan fees we had a very slow quarter in residential lending and i think some of that had to do with the cold weather that we experienced in the upper midwest especially in iowa and minnesota with that said april has been a large month in terms of closings for the home mortgage center they expect to catch up or nearly catch up to their annual plan in the second quarter so we don t have a significant amount of worry about that in addition we also were caught with the movement in treasury rates we have a larger than expected servicing rights adjustment of 227 000 on our servicing portfolio so when you put those two things together it was a probably the slowest quarter we ve had in a long time in the home mortgage center again we can t control what servicing rights do but the originations look very very positive for the second quarter in addition sba was very sluggish overall some of that had to do with the government shutdown they also have a good pipeline and are shaping up to have a good second quarter they think they will be back to their annual budget in the second quarter and i ll again say and i ve said this on past calls that our banker in denver is doing a tremendous job we are getting outstanding volume out of our sba banker in denver and it s very very important to our company s income statement and we expect that to continue in terms of wealth management trust and investment fees had a nice quarter good year over year gains we expect that for the most part to continue on the insurance agency those of you who are familiar with the insurance business the first quarter is when contingency payments are made so we did have a nice contingency payment which contributed to that line item on our income statement the insurance agency those of you who are familiar with the insurance business the first quarter is when contingency payments are made so we did have a nice contingency payment which contributed to that line item on our income statement so i think overall the second quarter was about as low as it s going to be for our company in terms of fee income and we expect much better results in the second quarter and beyond in terms of expenses not a lot to note the merger related expenses added 167 000 or about 0 01 per share to our run rate i will say one thing that was not in the earnings release we did announce during the quarter that we re going to close our north hudson wisconsin office we don t expect much attrition business attrition from that due to the fact we have an office about five miles away in hudson wisconsin and we think that the annualized reduction in expenses will be in the 250 000 to 300 000 range for that in terms of asset quality i have a few comments on asset quality non accrual loans were up 1 4 million and that represents a number of smaller credits perhaps four or five smaller credits and from where i sit i think we re making a lot of progress in identifying the issues in our loan portfolio and most of the issues that we re identifying now are in credits less than 500 000 i think we ve been through the larger credits we re very comfortable and i think this quarter the numbers reported don t reflect the progress that i see and i expect those numbers to change soon we will continue to give guidance on the loan loss provision as we did in the first quarter of 4 million to 6 million and while it was a little larger our run rate basis than that in the first quarter we expect that to moderate going forward in terms of ag everyone always asks about ag and i m sorry to disappoint everyone because our comments really aren t much different than they ve been for a couple of years ag is 7 6 of midwestone s portfolio let me give you four bullet points in terms of the big picture for ag borrowers that had good crop yields and good management practices generally made money and fared pretty well in 2018 that s a surprise to a lot of people there are a number of our customers who are doing reasonably well not as well as a six or seven years ago but still reasonably well those customers with high debt loads and poor crop yields did not fare well in 2018 if we look now that we re through the renewal season if we look at cash flow projections for our corn and soybean farmers for 2019 the cash flow projections are generally breakeven to slightly positive and i would say the primary reason for that is low commodity prices so if we get any relief on tariffs at all that could be a positive thing for our borrowers land prices which is important because a lot of these credits are still decent credits because of the land that s pledged to the bank land prices year over year down 2 to 3 and 10 to 15 from their peak five or six years ago and that really depends on the location but slightly lower but not significantly lower i ll give you three mileposts or mile markers or metrics for our portfolio a year ago we had just under 47 million in watch and substandard ag credits one year later at 3 31 2019 that was 39 million so down 17 if you look at just the substandard category during the same time period that has increased about 10 from just under 19 million to 21 6 million but if you look at the entire portfolio at midwestone a year ago we had 23 5 that was classified watch or substandard that s down to 21 so i think it does reflect some progress in our portfolio overall from 23 5 to 21 watch and substandard again slightly higher amount of substandard credits in the portfolio i would say that the level of charge offs that we ve seen in ag has not been unreasonable given the stress that is in the ag economy and i will say that again from where i sit that our level of portfolio management and administration has improved significantly and i continue to be confident as i have been in the past that we will not experience large charge offs in our ag portfolio in terms of capital it s of note we did continue to repurchase shares when the opportunity presented itself during the quarter and we continue to see very good value at the price points that we hit in our repurchase program miscellaneous items we did recently complete an fdic exam with really nothing unusual to report on that front in terms of the american trust transaction a bit of news for everyone and i think it s all good news we do expect to close the transaction on may 1st i ll remind everyone this one took longer to approve than most because we had regulatory approval in short order but we required the disposition of american trust retirement division that was a long and arduous process but that has been completed and my understanding is that will close today which clears the desk for our may 1 close it s been an exciting time for our company and we think that our shareholders will be very excited as well we did rerun the projections that we put out last august because we had not run the projections since last august because we didn t know for sure what the close date would be and the good news is that these numbers or projections have not changed materially since last august transaction costs are going to wind up being a little bit higher which i attribute to the long timeframe that took to close and that the ongoing negotiation that took place between three parties during this time frame the earnings per share accretion excluding transaction costs in 2019 is projected to be 12 4 we project the earnings per share accretion in 2020 is in the 18 to 19 range and in 2021 in the 15 range give or take a few tenths of a percent we feel very good about our ability to execute on the cost saves in fact much of that has been completed already we have a little bit yet to do but feel very very good about that american trust two banks asset quality continues to be well above average when you look at their peer group so that asset quality has been maintained during this period of time one thing that the american trust has never focused on is deposit growth and we think that we can benefit by having a renewed emphasis or our initial emphasis in that company on the importance of core deposits so we re excited about that they have in all of their locations excellent commercial bankers and we ve been able to maintain that commercial banking team in large part and we re very very pleased about that they have a good branch network and again i will remind those who may have forgotten that the midwestone trust department will essentially triple bringing over the large american trust department and again very little attrition in that trust department since the announcement and i think that adds a new dynamic to our company that we haven t had before certainly trust will be a much bigger contributor to our income statement than it has been in the past so i would summarize and say that business conditions throughout our footprint with the exception of the ag are such that we expect to return to loan growth and normal non interest income growth in quarter two and we do look forward to getting back to where we can show topline revenue growth and that s certainly our plan for the rest of this year so in the room i have we have barry ray who is our chief financial officer gary sims our chief credit officer jim cantrell our treasurer and chief investment officer and kevin kramer our chief operating officer and we will be happy to answer any questions you might have so i would turn it back to you jacob questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question comes from damon delmonte with kbw please go ahead damon delmonte kbw analyst good afternoon guys how is going today charles n funk president and chief executive officer good damon barry s ray chief financial officer good morning damon damon delmonte kbw analyst good morning so just wanted to see if we can get a little guidance the deal as you said is closing on may 1st and obviously a lot of moving parts during in the second quarter and you probably won t get a clean run rate almost until the fourth quarter but just wondering if we can get a little perspective as to what we can expect for the non interest expense over the next couple of quarters barry s ray chief financial officer damon this is barry i would say that from a non interest expense perspective probably had about 20 5 million i might pick up the number another 25 million to 27 million per quarter well i m sorry for the year charles n funk president and chief executive officer okay is it 25 million for the year yeah did you get that damon damon delmonte kbw analyst yeah i am sorry ok 25 million got it and then can we just maybe talk a bit about the margin dynamics and i think when you take out accretive yield the core margin was down 5 basis points on the quarter how are you seeing the competitive landscape here i know you said it was competitive but how are you see in upcoming quarters maybe now with the way the fed has paused and what can we expect with that core margin james m cantrell chief investment officer and treasurer yeah damon this is jim i think charlie did a pretty good job of summarizing it upfront when he talked about our cost of funds were increasing and i would say in the quarter we played a lot of defense when we came to managing some of our larger balance accounts we had a lot of customers come in and talk to our or tried to talk to or i should say a lot of competitors come in and make efforts to woo some of our better and larger deposit customers away from us with rate and so i would say they were it s hard for me to even enumerate the number of times we had to move rates from say 1 or 1 25 on an account up to 2 and even 2 25 so i wish i could tell you that that had been abating we haven t had a fed increase since december and so we did not have a fed increase in the first quarter and yet i would say we were playing as much defense in the first quarter as we ve played all in 2018 damon delmonte kbw analyst okay so that s kind of give you some color for what we re seeing james m cantrell chief investment officer and treasurer and you don t really expect that to change in the next couple of months yeah well i would like for it to change i see nothing in front of me that indicates to me that it s going to change and charlie mentioned yield curve too i think that s the other thing for our balance sheet it s positioned like ours we ve got roughly 70 of earning assets that are pricing somewhere in three to five year sector since the end of the third quarter we probably lost 75 or 100 basis points on the curve as charlie said in terms of flatly with fed increasing once and term rates coming down so i think it s going to be a challenge for us moving forward so that s about how i see it right now damon delmonte kbw analyst okay fair enough and then charlie you kind of reiterated your full year outlook for loan growth any particular asset classes that are showing better opportunities than others charles n funk president and chief executive officer i would say that if c i and commercial real estate would be the primary tool one of the things that we have been getting a little closer to our internal guidance on that on our occupied commercial real estate and bringing american trust on they have that percentage of our total portfolio will actually go down because american trust tends to be more of a c i bank although they do have commercial real estate so i think the primary drivers of that are going to be c i and commercial real estate certainly c i out of denver and little c i out of iowa city and commercial real estate out of the twin cities and iowa city kevin e kramer chief operating officer and damon this is kevin kramer i ll also add some of the new bankers new talent that we ve been able to bring on in the twin cities and other parts of our market have been c i focused so we ll start our mix of commercial ops focus on c i continues to improve damon delmonte kbw analyst great ok that s all i had for now thank you very much guys charles n funk president and chief executive officer thank you damon operator the next question comes from jeff rulis with d a davidson please go ahead jeff rulis d a davidson analyst thanks good morning charles n funk president and chief executive officer hi jeff barry s ray chief financial officer good morning jeff jeff rulis d a davidson analyst i guess first question is on and i m sorry i hopped on a little late but if you could talk about the flood impacts in the region and maybe your exposure if you can range bound that from what you re seeing charles n funk president and chief executive officer actually most of the flooding was in southwest iowa where we have no offices there could be a little bit in eastern iowa as the depending on the spring ranged but i don t think we have a lot of exposure to flood i mean i don t see any i ll let gary may have better knowledge but gary l sims chief credit officer yeah yes jeff this is gary sims we did survey our ag bankers and we don t have any exposure to that southwest iowa area that experienced that primary flooding jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay well thank you and just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the fee income i guess expectations for mortgage to come back but overall could we talk about run rate or path of potential kind of for the full year where you see that figure headed either broadly or more specific barry s ray chief financial officer this is barry jeff as we stated looking back probably the fourth quarter of 2018 where we were 5 8 million for fee income is probably the closer estimate of the run rate jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay so that s kind of a core figure of 5 8 million and maybe growth off of that or notwithstanding atb but the legacy would you think that 5 8 million kind of expands from there or charles n funk president and chief executive officer yeah no it s a good point and there s room for that i think there were some swap there s some opportunities for swap income that could move that higher for sure and there are a couple of transactions that are in the pipeline right now i m not sure that closed yet but they are certainly being contemplated and discussed with the borrowers so yes there is room for growth off of that and especially in the home mortgage center because it is their busy season and so yeah obviously there would be room for growth off of that kevin e kramer chief operating officer jeff this is kevin kramer the only thing i would add is we ve made some investments in technology as well from a service charge point of view that will allow us to better customize pricing and that will add to an increased opportunity on the service charge especially commercial service charge platform that we ve been able to implement in prior years jeff rulis d a davidson analyst okay that s a good color thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from brian martin with fig partners please go ahead brian martin fig partners analyst hey guys charles n funk president and chief executive officer hi brian gary l sims chief credit officer hi brian brian martin fig partners analyst just a couple of things for me just as it relates to the closing on the transaction charlie or whomever just kind of the just to add for the fee income and expense for the acquisition can you kind of just give an idea of what the add is broadly for the fee income component of at and then the expense side and then just when the conversion is so when you actually convert it so we know when there s clean quarter from an expense standpoint i think earlier someone mentioned maybe fourth quarter but just want to kind of look at that conversion i mean what at brings for those buckets charles n funk president and chief executive officer yeah i ll give you the easy part on the conversion they have two banks we re going to convert the smaller wisconsin bank on may 20th and we re going to convert the dubuque bank on july 15th or in the middle of july so that s when we convert but they become part of our company obviously on may 1st so i might let barry are you ready to answer that or barry s ray chief financial officer yeah i would say on the fee income side probably around on an annual basis about 12 million sort of fee income brian martin fig partners analyst okay and then the expense side i think you said was the 25 million you said earlier was that just the remaining balance barry s ray chief financial officer it s not the annual numbers though for the balance of the year and again not including merger related costs let s call it probably somewhere in the 7 million odd per quarter addition again excluding merger related costs brian martin fig partners analyst okay so the 25 million was just three quarters it wasn t the full year i was just trying to make sure i had the right annual numbers the annual numbers are more like the 28 million it adds to the expense for the year barry s ray chief financial officer please remember we ended 26 million 27 million range yeah 28 million brian martin fig partners analyst okay perfect okay and then just charlie you talked you mentioned the part about the provision in kind of the guidance i mean even though the first quarter was a bit higher and you expected to step back were you suggesting that the guide that you had kind of given the 4 to 6 is still a good level to think about charles n funk president and chief executive officer it s an appropriate level to think about and some of it depends on how much progress we continue to make but we feel very comfortable with 4 to 6 for the whole year brian martin fig partners analyst i got you okay and then maybe one just for jim on the margin it sounds i mean you and you referenced in your remarks charlie about the margin being the greatest decline this quarter and really not abating i mean it didn t sound like i guess the outlook is still just in the core margin is lower based on what you re seeing today and maybe just less of a decline going forward or maybe not you re not stating that because it sounds like it s not getting better so could it be another 5 basis points or would that be out of the question as you guys look at it today james m cantrell chief investment officer and treasurer brian this is jim as you suggest 5 basis points seemed a little bit big to me for a quarter i would not expect that we re going to see that that s going to represent kind of new norm in terms of our margin but i do think we will see some but i think five basis points a quarter is probably too much to anticipate in terms of a narrowing ph i hesitate somewhat to give you a number but somewhere between 0 and 5 how s that brian martin fig partners analyst yeah that s fine but i guess bottom line as you might think if the fed is on pause you might see a little bit of easing of that pressure in the back half of the year or maybe second quarter is still a little bit higher but it could level out a little bit after that james m cantrell chief investment officer and treasurer yeah i would a lot of it s going to depend on just the competition in our marketplace and what we have to do to react to keep large deposits i do think the cd book which is 700 million almost 750 million 27 million in the quarter the rate of increase on that will slow down because we re close to the terminal value that s a portfolio that turns out pretty quickly and so we ll quickly move and then we ll slow down in the next i would think quarter or two to see it slowdown on the cd book increase charles n funk president and chief executive officer the other thing brain just to remind you and the others who are on call that american trust margin is nowhere close to ours they re running right around 3 give or take maybe even a little less than 3 and i think it s fair to say that we have modeled a slow but sure expansion of the legacy american trust margin as well because i just think we ll focus on that maybe a little bit more and we foresee some improvement but we re going to just when you put the two together our margin is going to go down because our margin is lower brian martin fig partners analyst okay yeah that s helpful okay i appreciate that charlie and then maybe just you talked about the branch closure and the savings that comes from that when is that when do you begin to start to see some of that flow through i didn t hear when you re closing the branch maybe i missed that charles n funk president and chief executive officer yeah and i apologize i should have said that we plan to complete that project at the end of this quarter so it should be a relatively clean run rate in the third quarter relatively could be a little bit lingering but all of it s going to be done in june and there may be some carryover expenses into july but the annualized savings are 250 million to 300 million ph brian martin fig partners analyst okay that s helpful and then just last one on expenses so if you have the conversion i guess made in i think you said june and july would fourth quarter would be the best way to think about a clean quarter from an expense standpoint barry s ray chief financial officer yeah this is is barry i would say the fourth quarter would be again inaudible the best quarter for the clean run rate yes analyst analyst yeah okay all right i think that s all i had guys thanks i appreciate it charles n funk president and chief executive officer yeah thank you brian operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to charles funk for any closing remarks charles n funk president and chief executive officer yes thank you jacob well thanks for everyone to everyone for being on the call this morning and as always if there s something we missed or you need further information or questions

a good definition of a liberal might be someone who tries to ignore the actual nature of reality thus many politically correct formulations distort reality even to the point of denying the differences between the sexes ignoring the nature of reality can get particularly dangerous when applied to economics the nature of money calls for having sufficient control over the money supply to prevent the breakdown of the system it calls for keeping debt levels low some liberals are now trying to turn conventional economy policy upside down by changing all the rules the new economics is called modern monetary theory or mmt for short mmt is gaining traction among high profile democrats and other liberals that are looking for ways to finance social and ecological programs that they hope to implement in the future the present monetary system with its 22 trillion and growing debt is too rigid and constraining something new is needed to provide more flexible and expandable financing the answer is mmt the basic tenets of mmt critics say that mmt is neither monetary nor a theory it more closely resembles a political opportunity since it puts everything in the hands of enlightened politicians its promoters keep the theory sufficiently vague to avoid close scrutiny they tend to stay outside of the mainstream economic journals and inside social media nevertheless liberal economist heather boushey claims that the theory has moved to center stage in the political debate it is the catchphrase of economists pundits and politicians who hold it up as the answer to our economic problems prof stephanie kelton of stony brook university with two co authors summarize the theory s magic formula as anything that is technically feasible is financially affordable the two basic tenets of mmt are dear to liberal hearts first governments can spend much more than they tax secondly promoters claim that governments should use taxes not as a generator of revenue but as an instrument of inflation control and achieving equality mmt advocates say that deficit spending does not matter for countries like the united states that borrow in their own currency governments can issue money using mechanisms like the federal reserve to self finance their budgets the mmters claim that the present monetary policies of setting interest rates and controlling the money supply by the fed are no longer needed as tools for balancing an economy the new tools for job creation and economic growth should be increased federal spending and taxation when things get rough the government can spend its way to full employment by printing up money when the economy booms and inflation threatens the government can contract the money supply by taxing it down to acceptable levels creating a climate of instability and distrust mmt takes the control of policy out of the hands of economists and puts it into those of politicians it replaces long term planning with short term spending such policies will have more immediate effects since increased spending impacts the economy directly mmters claims politicians will not abuse their newly acquired powers since they can be voted out if they err in judgment more likely than not politicians will probably be rewarded by the amount of mmt funded pork that they can bring back to their districts most conventional economists observe that failure to think in the long term creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust that destabilizes markets moreover the far out ideas of mmt have never been tested but like deficits and taxes that does not seem to matter no one really cares that not even liberal economists like paul krugman give it much credence former treasury secretary larry summers for example called it voodoo economics it is a sad reflection of these twitter times in which nothing has consequences and everything runs on impressions and emotions in the age of fake news fake money makes sense it is enough to feel and believe that it will work and finance the green new deal for it to gain acceptance meanwhile no one answers the real question of who is going to pay down the federal debt
profits at china s industrial firms grew in march rebounding from four months of contraction adding to optimism the world s second largest economy may be starting to stabilise a return to profits could add to the debate over how much more stimulus beijing needs to pump into the economy if it is on the mend beijing and washington appear to be edging towards a trade deal but investors are concerned that a sharp slowdown in china will have repercussions on the wider global economy profits in march rose 13 9 percent year on year to 589 52 billion yuan 87 62 billion the national bureau of statistics nbs said on its website on saturday recovering from a 14 percent fall in the first two months that marked the biggest monthly increase since july 2018 for the first quarter of the year profits notched up by industrial companies dropped 3 3 percent to 1 3 trillion yuan compared with a year earlier according to the nbs the growth in march mainly came from an acceleration in production and sales as well as a recovery of profits in key industrial sectors zhu hong of the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data the pick up in industrial profits eased concerns about the slowing momentum in china s economy as it has been cooling for the past year weighed down by a bitter trade dispute with the united states as well as a campaign to curb debt risks that has led to higher financing costs for companies the government has ramped up stimulus measures this year announcing billions of dollars in additional tax cuts and infrastructure spending growth in china s industrial output increased at the fastest pace since july 2014 in march while gross domestic product grew 6 4 percent beating expectations producer prices in the meantime also picked up for the first time in nine months in march lifted by higher global commodity prices and government efforts to boost domestic demand however there are still concerns about whether the turnarounds will be sustainable as gains could have been due to seasonal factors such as the resumption in constructions after the lunar new year instead of a rebound in broader demand most of china s major steel makers logged smaller earnings in the first quarter due to higher raw material prices and weak demand the country s largest listed steel firm baoshan iron steel co ltd posted its first negative growth since 2015 on wednesday jiangsu shagang co ltd china s biggest private owned steel mill reported a 60 62 percent decrease in its q1 net profit too upstream sectors such as mining and metal producers and state owned firms still dominated the biggest share of profit gains profits for oil and natural gas extraction rose 10 3 percent in the first versus a 5 7 percent decline in the january february period profits at china s state owned industrial firms however declined 13 4 percent on an annual basis for the first quarter according to the statistics bureau liabilities of industrial firms rose 6 5 percent year on year as of end march the nbs said the data includes companies with annual revenues of more than 20 million yuan from their main operations 1 6 7282 chinese yuan renminbi
spring has arrived will gold also bloom recent positive news suggest the us economy spring revival but what about gold will it blossom will the gold love trade take reins from gold as a safe haven play retail sales surge last week the government has released its latest report on the retail sector the retail sales jumped 1 6 percent in march the best results since september 2017 as one can see in the chart below the change was above expectations the economists polled by marketwatch forecasted sales to climb 1 1 percent and it was solid 0 9 percent even if we set gas and autos aside chart 1 retail sales monthly change from january 2014 to march 2019 the strong retail sales added to mounting evidence that the us economy is firming up as we have reported the nonfarm payrolls rebounded in march while jobless claims dropped below 200 000 in the first week of april for the first time since 1969 hence the recent economic reports suggest that the us labor market remains healthy we have steady hiring declining jobless claims rising wages and the lowest unemployment rate in half a century the fears about softening us economy have thus turned out to be overblown just as we have been repeating for a long time since the great recession weak first quarter however the gdp growth in q1 2019 might be higher than previously estimated and a rebound in spring has been a recurring pattern we do not deny that the pace of growth will be slower than in 2018 after all the effects of fiscal stimulus vanished but we reject the narrative about the looming economic slump it s true that the yield curve has inverted but the inversion was small and temporary and china s government has provided a fresh stimulus which should support the american economy as well last but not least the trade talks with china are progressing well while the chances of trump s impeachment have fallen sharply with the release of the mueller report all these developments reduce the downside risks for the us economy implications for gold what does it imply for the gold market well the more vigorously growing american economy should not help the yellow metal the risk appetite has revived putting safe haven assets in a difficult position another problem is that the us economic growth is accelerating while the prospects for the europe and japan are much darker hence the greenback could remain strong relative to the euro and the yen moreover the positive economic news may encourage the fed to adopt a more hawkish stance which should also hit gold or at least to spur such speculations and expectations indeed traders have shifted from projecting a rate cut later this year to now putting the odds of a cut by december 2019 at only 50 percent we argue that even these reduced odds are excessively pessimistic the fomc may pause for a few months but given the strong labor market and frothy valuations of certain assets it shouldn t cut interest rates such a move would unsettle markets which closely follow how the fed sees the economy while leaving the us central bank with less ammunition when the next economic crisis hits the economy therefore when we get more positive economic reports the market participants could change their views this is bad news for the gold bulls as the revised expectations of the future path of the federal funds rate would make gold struggle the fomc members will gather again next week so powell will provide us with more clues about the current fed s stance thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the link

u s highlights the american economy grew by 3 2 in the first quarter of 2019 comfortably beating market expectations however the strength was driven by inventories and net exports while domestic demand growth weakened the housing market continues to be an economic weak link existing home sales in march fell below expectations a lack of inventory appears to be weighing on sales activity as confirmed in the gdp report price pressures were softer than expected early in the year underpinning the federal reserve s move to the sidelines canadian highlights the bank of canada s april mpr was front and center this week both the global and canadian economic outlooks were revised down for 2019 the canadian economy is now estimated to be operating with more slack lasting longer than previously forecast this suggests that current stimulative interest rates will need to persist for some time the weaker economic outlook is broadly consistent with our march qef as such we anticipate that the policy interest rate will hold steady through 2020 u s q1 growth surge shakier underneath the hood the u s economy brushed off disruptions caused by the partial government shutdown and abnormal weather and grew strongly in the first quarter beating consensus expectations by 0 9 percentage points 3 2 vs 2 3 however behind the sheen of the solid headline the drivers of growth were not as lustrous domestic demand growth weakened with consumers saving a little more and businesses slightly more cautious with their investments dollars instead inventories and net exports the more volatile components of gdp provided the heavy lifting the build up of inventories is now a three quarter trend it is likely to be reversed in the quarters ahead dragging on real gdp growth the good news is that with temporary disruptions dissipating domestic demand should improve next quarter taking the mantle in driving growth amid the hurrah of strong real gdp growth the one segment of the economy that continued to underperform was housing residential investment contracted in all four quarters of 2018 and pulled back again in the first quarter early indications suggest a mixed start to the second quarter existing home sales fell 4 9 in march below consensus expectations the pullback followed a strong gain in february but the level of sales has shown little overall progress over the past several months and is well off peak levels seen in the fall of 2017 fortunately the news was better on the new home sales front new single family residential sales rose 4 5 building on even stronger gains in january and february in contrast to the existing market new home sales are just a touch below the recent cycle peak with affordability improving a function of both lower mortgage rates and accelerating income growth the demand drivers for housing appears to be solid the supply side appears to be the constraining factor the inventory of existing homes available for sale continues to hover near historical lows unless supply constraints are alleviated the upswing in demand could reverse the recent deceleration home price growth speaking of prices pce inflation data for 19q1 was released alongside gdp data and came in surprisingly soft we cannot yet tell which month the weakness was concentrated as only january data are available february and march data will only be released on monday nevertheless the weaker reading in q1 indicates cooling price pressures reinforcing the federal reserve s position to hold off any interest rate hikes through 2019 bond yields appear to have dipped lower following the digestion of these details discounting the surprise in real gdp growth headline inflation is likely to see something of a lift in upcoming months reflecting the broad based rebound in oil prices since the end of 2018 still the ride may be bumpy the west texas intermediate oil price benchmark hit 65 earlier in the week before falling on friday on word that trump has been upping the pressure on opec this despite news that the administration will no longer exempt countries from iran sanctions beginning may 2nd canada toward a lower neutral rate and not beyond a light data week allowed the highly anticipated bank of canada interest rate decision to garner the attention it deserved a disappointing end to 2018 oil production curtailments and mixed data at the start of 2019 raised concerns about whether the canadian economy was heading for recession in its april mpr global growth in 2019 is forecast to have slowed to a 3 2 pace half a point weaker than last year this markdown largely reflects elevated global economic uncertainty as broadening trade tensions weigh on activity slower foreign growth is bad for commodities and other goods canada exports the bank of canada acknowledged this by broadly marking down its canadian outlook for this year canada s economy has been going through a rough patch since the middle of last year and the softness should remain through the end of this quarter first half weakness combined with little growth to end 2018 motivated the bank s downgrade of 2019 gdp growth to 1 2 from 1 7 in january the bank s first quarter growth was revised down to 0 3 q q annualized from january s 0 8 forecast broadly in line with our tracking overall the bank s downgraded economic outlook better reflects the reality for both the global and canadian economies a softer 2019 and rebound to only just above trend growth next year does little to absorb the slack in the economy that has materialized in the last few quarters chart 1 a more negative output gap is consistent with subdued slightly below target inflation such an outlook does not call for rate hikes in fact this outlook suggests that current stimulative interest rates may need to persist for some time the downgrade parade didn t end with the economic outlook a reevaluation of potential gdp growth saw the trend running speed of the canadian economy reduced to 1 7 next year a tenth of a point lower relative to april 2018 s assumption soft business investment and strong labour markets sent the bank s view of trend productivity growth about 0 3 ppts lower through 2021 a weaker outlook for domestic trend productivity growth and the fed s march downgrade in its interest rate outlook motivated the bank of canada s markdown of its nominal neutral rate range by 25bps although unobservable and highly uncertain the neutral rate has been used as an anchoring mechanism for interest rate expectations by the fed and the bank of canada governor poloz has often referred to it as home moving the lower end of the nominal range down to 2 25 suggests that the policy rate of 1 75 although below neutral was less stimulative than previously assumed chart 2 although downgrades were the dominant theme there is scope for cautious optimism domestic service industries remain resilient and wage growth in most of canada has improved

previous month in particular we expect a minor rebound in manufacturing jobs following two disappointing payroll prints however this is likely to be more than offset by a deceleration in job creation in the services sector we do flag risks to the upside on the back of a larger than expected recovery in employment in the retail sector after two notable declines in february and march all in the household survey should show the unemployment rate ticked down a tenth to 3 7 while wages are expected to rise 0 2 m m this should leave the annual print unchanged at 3 2 however if we get a soft 0 2

expects industry level gdp to remain unchanged in february following the robust 0 3 print last month activity data for the month of february was mixed on balance with retail and manufacturing sales helping to offset one another however volumes were disproportionately skewed to the downside due to a large increase in consumer prices weather will also have an adverse impact if the sharp pullbacks in residential construction and home sales offer any signal although this will be partially offset by higher utilities output looking to the energy sector mandated production caps began to roll off by an initial 75bpd in february leaving the daily maximum production 250k barrels below 2018 levels down from 325k in january however preliminary crude production figures show weaker output during the month which suggests that transportation bottlenecks continue to impact upstream activity despite less government intervention

visit indian school of business isb chief technology officer visit if modi fails to form the government the stock markets are going down without a doubt but then if it goes down too much one will buy because india is still going to grow at 7 says chris wood clsa in an interview with ruchi bhatia of et now given we are right in the middle of the election season it is interesting that we have not been discussing elections that much the investors in india believe they cannot do anything about the elections in the long term and are of the view that india is still going to grow at 7 gdp or thereabouts so the professional investment community thinks that while the election will be of importance in the short run a 5 10 year view remains that india will continue to grow in the 7 range in terms of meeting the people in the government it has been very good precisely because the election is going on and people have time to talk as their political masters are occupied elsewhere so not one meeting has been cancelled or delayed yes the smaller the majority the harder it will be politically to implement big ticket reforms people seem to be assuming the incumbent government will get re elected but we may never know for sure however if the incumbent government gets re elected the key issue for the market is it will want to see a big enough majority to allow the prime minister to continue to run the government in the way he has run it in the last five years and that is a highly centralised form of management so many critics of the current government would not like that but if you ask me what the stock market would like the stock market s ideal outcome would be as big a majority possible for the current government nobody has had an idea but people believe that the incumbent government has run an effective campaign however what s interesting is the campaign has not been focussed on economic issues yes i have high regard for the election machine of the current bjp leadership and that they are clearly extremely effective at fighting election campaigns it makes sense to not fight or base the election campaign purely on the economy that clearly was the case back in 2004 when i remember that everybody expected the bjp government to win and the result was dramatically opposite and the market collapsed for about five days i am going to wait for the election outcome my key point is the sensex is about to reach my long term target but obviously we have to remember sensex is not dollar dominated so i have to say i am more constructive about it in the long term my bullishness on indian equities is greater than my bullishness on the indian rupee dollar swap strikes to me as quite an imaginative idea and it should help in managing corporates hedging costs i think it is a good innovation meanwhile from a bigger macro standpoint not so long ago there was a lot of criticism of the government around the change of the rbi saying that the government was interfering with central bank independence they were criticised in saying the monetary policy was too tight and upon this whole issue of deploying capital from the rbi for other uses i personally was sympathetic to the government s standpoint that the monetary policy was too tight here in india i would say since the leadership of the rbi has changed we have seen more monetary easing i would say the basic comparative stability of the indian currency and the government bond market since the monetary easing commenced actually vindicates the criticism of the government because if the rbi was being irresponsibly slack then it will see downward pressure in the currency and the bond market on the capital issue but that to me again is a storm in a tea cup the rbi is overcapitalised as the fed is undercapitalised yes because rbi is massively over capitalised the us fed is completely under capitalised so compared with the insane things happening in the g 7 world where i gave you the example of the bank of japan it has 50 of the japanese government bonds on its balance sheet we have had massive quantitative easing in the euro zone where you have crazy negative rates what is going on here is highly orthodox so yes i do not see an issue there fundamentally margaret thatcher had an agenda to basically change uk which she succeeded in doing but she was able to do that partly because she formed the government three times but towards the end of her first term in government it was far from clear that margaret thatcher was going to be re elected because she was implementing some painful structural reforms and that i think is where there is a bit of analogy with the situation here if he loses power the stock markets are going down without a doubt yes but then obviously it goes down too much one will buy it because india is still going to grow at 7 i think the worst case is the precedent of what we saw in 2004 there was less downside at the start of the year because at the start of the year foreigners had increased their holdings in indian equities for three years all the net buying in india over the last few years has been by domestic mutual funds but began the year and people were very concerned about the outcome of the general elections since then we have had these polls that predicted a bjp victory with a reduced majority and since those polls came out foreign investors have increased their holdings in indian equities i am in a world where mr modi is re elected with the decent majority and can still basically run india out of the pm office which is what he has been doing in my view it is the most efficient way of running india the single biggest risk for the indian equities story is oil i always tell global investors who have weightings in india that it makes sense to consider having some oil stocks as a hedge i am personally constructive on oil i was bullish on oil last year also and then oil was going up then we had this dramatic decline in the fourth quarter which in my view was a classic bull market correction bull market corrections are short sharp and violent the ex post facto rationalisation of talking heads to explain this oil collapse was increased production of us shale the real reason for this violent correction in oil was a combination of extreme investor positioning and donald trump s u turn because investors were long on oil because they believed the americans were 100 serious about imposing these sanctions on people who sell also iran then as we all know donald trump did this big u turn and oil collapsed he then successfully managed to put pressure on saudi arabia to increase production so now this has become topical again because the americans are making noises that they are not going to renew the waivers next week personally although this is not what i am saying in public i have a hard time believing the american president is really going to implement this well nothing has changed since six months ago so if he does not back off and he implements the waivers then oil in my view is getting much higher for the same reason he backed off last time no he wants higher oil prices for the support base i also believe saudi arabia is less likely to increase production on the us pressure than before also the american president is trying to agree to a trade deal with china they are nearer towards getting that deal done after many months so why provoke a huge argument with beijing which is what will happen since china is the biggest buyer of iranian oil china simply does not accept the american point of view on this they do not believe that they are doing anything wrong i do not believe that mr trump is actually is so obsessed about iran himself personally the pressure on this is coming from the national security lobby in washington reasonably yes but clearly there is potential for this i do not think we have seen the last of the ripples from this crisis because a lot of institutions have had to slow growth dramatically and also the fundamental nature of the corporate bond market has changed now bond investors do not look at credit ratings as much but rather look at the parentage of the nbfc there are nbfcs without classic blue chip parentage so as far as i can understand many of them are looking to get banking licences what it means is that the years of supercharge growth from the nbfcs are over the core sector i will continue to own is private sector banks and obviously the quality nbfcs there is a distressed opportunity in other nbfcs and if you pick the right ones then they will outperform everything else another area is the well capitalised property companies with long term track records you can take advantage of the dramatic consolidation triggered by rera legislation then cement is a long term hold in india obviously there are cyclical variables but the consumer side remains interesting in the short term though it is going to be a risk we are seeing early signs of the nbfc blow up which could impact the consumption trends in the short term simply because the loan growth has slowed sharply
insights into editorial uncertain times on india s oil imports context united states announced that it would not extend beyond may 1 the 180 day waiver it had granted to eight countries including india to purchase oil from iran india will stop importing crude oil from iran following the us move to end sanction waivers and will use alternate supply sources such as saudi arabia to make up for the lost volumes the trump administration decided not to renew waiver that let countries like india buy iranian oil without facing us sanctions iran and india s oil basket india the world s third biggest oil consumer meets more than 80 of its crude oil requirements and around 40 of its natural gas needs through imports domestic oil and natural gas production have been declining for the last few years even as the energy needs of the economy have grown india is iran s top oil buyer after china in 2018 19 it imported 23 5 million tonnes from iran in the previous year almost 10 of its total 220 4 million tonnes of crude imports was from iran iran was the fourth largest supplier of oil to india in 2018 19 and other suppliers may not provide the same benefits in the form of price and credit facilities india acceding to the us sanctions on iran india has said the country is sufficiently prepared to deal with the impact of the us decision to curtail the temporary exemption from sanctions on the purchase of iranian oil government mentioned that a robust plan has been put in place for adequate supply of crude to refineries petroleum minister said the country plans to increase imports from major oil producing nations other than iran indicating that it will be acceding to the u s plan to reduce iran s oil exports to zero however ratings agency icra has estimated that stopping oil imports from iran could cost indian refineries as much as 2 500 crore potential impact on india analysts point to key metrics that could be impacted by the current situation current account deficit higher crude oil prices will widen the trade deficit and current account deficit given that the value of imports goes up with crude oil and that the quantity imported tends to be sticky in general according to care a permanent increase in crude oil prices by 10 under ceteris paribus conditions could translate into the current account deficit increasing by 0 4 0 5 of gdp rupee the currency could be impacted if the trade and current account deficits were to widen an increase in the import bill will tend to put pressure on the rupee inflation there could be significant impact on inflation given how crude oil prices move and the extent to which the government allows the pass through to the consumer the crude oil price could be an important consideration when the monetary policy committee meets for its bi monthly meeting in june fiscal impact there could be a two pronged impact on government finances both on the revenue side and on the expenditure side on the revenue side higher oil prices mean more revenue for the states as tax is ad valorem for the centre though it may not materially impact the fiscal math as the duty rates are fixed us wants to isolate iran by imposing sanctions us secretary of state mike pompeo said that the latest decision intended to bring iran s oil exports to zero oil is the lifeline of the nation which continues to export one million barrels per day bpd it exported 2 7 million bpd before the sanctions kicked in last year us said so far the sanctions had deprived the regime of more than 10 billion in oil sales iran responded strait of hormuz world s most critical oil choke point iran threatened to close the strait of hormuz a neck of water between its southern coast and the northern tip of the sultanate of oman strait of hormuz lane through which a third of the world s seaborne oil passes every day it is a threat that iran has made earlier too and this strategic area has seen several flashpoints erupt in tehran s fraught relationship with the west over the years iranian exports will not actually reach zero china will continue buying iranian crude perhaps as high as several hundred thousand bpd to save face china may barter for the oil or wall off banks to handle transactions in renminbi india will likely take a similar position iran has repeatedly threatened to disrupt the flow of oil through the strait of hormuz if it s prevented from using the persian gulf through which about a third of all oil traded at sea passes such a move could threaten saudi exports as the route is used for most oil shipments from the kingdom us statement says that if chinese imports from iran do not drop quickly the us sanctions could be applied to beijing s central bank the people s bank of china conclusion international energy markets are critically dependent on reliable transport over 60 of the world s petroleum and other liquids production moves on maritime routes blocking the maritime choke points can lead to huge increases in energy costs and world energy prices choke points are also the places where tankers are most vulnerable to pirates terrorist attacks political unrest war and shipping accidents for india if india is to protect its interests in the ever volatile global oil market the government will need to take steps to diversify its supplier base and also work towards increasing domestic sources of energy supplies
