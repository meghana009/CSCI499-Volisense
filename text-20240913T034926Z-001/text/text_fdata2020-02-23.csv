the us dollar s surge alongside gold has eclipsed the equity market rally as the key development in the capital markets even the traditional seemingly safe haven yen was no match for the greenback the dollar appeared to have been rolling over in q4 19 as the sentiment surveys in europe improved japanese officials seemingly thought the economy could withstand a sales tax increase and data suggested the chinese economy was gaining some traction however 2020 has begun with new divergence the covid 19 virus has not only crippled the chinese economy but its sheer size and magnitude of its integration in the global supply chains have far reaching knock on effects asia pacific economies that were increasingly reliant on chinese input and demand are the most vulnerable estimates suggest that the world s second largest economy is operating well less than 50 of capacity indeed the extension of the stoppages and disruptions increase the likelihood that the chinese economy contracts in q1 the supply chain disruptions are adversely impacting japanese and korean automakers german automakers derived a substantial share of their profits from china and car sales continue to weaken volkswagen for example has ceased production at a third of its 33 plants in china which accounts for around half of its total production chinese autos sales in the first half of february were off 92 from a year ago japan s sales tax increase in october and the typhoons dealt the world s third largest economy a significant blow and a deep quarterly contraction of 1 5 despite government efforts to soften the blow through incentives to consume the impact was nearly as much as the previous sales tax hike this self inflicted shock coupled with the slowing of china and the typhoons leaves the japanese economy vulnerable japan s exposure to china through trade and tourism maybe a sufficient knock for the fragile economy to lead to a contraction here in q1 it would be the second consecutive quarterly contraction a rule of thumb often used to mark a recession and underscores the fact that negative interest rates do not prevent economic downturns arguably the tightening of japan s fiscal policy through the tax increase was partly offset by the other fiscal incentives to blunt the contractionary impulse yet the measures appeared to have minimal impact at best the tax which has been increased in a few steps was initially foisted on japan by multilateral institutions but took on a political life of its own in japan beyond the economic arguments pundits and journalists shake their heads at what appears to be a self defeating policy however german s reluctance to use its fiscal space is seen as not just folly but dangerous as well the european central bank the imf and many american and british economists do not understand why germany is not borrowing money at negative interest rates to fund public investment even the german bundesbank has accepted that the fetish for the black zero which both parties of the coalition government have supported in word and deed is doing harm often the conversations have an air of america is from mars and europe is from venus little illustrates this insight like the appreciation that guilt and debt are derived from the same word in german and dutch in america in contrast debt and bankruptcy have been liberated from moral stigma it is about using opm or other people s money the ability to service one s debt has become the issue not the debt itself between student loans mortgages auto loans and credit cards americans spend most of their lives in debt the magnitude of the trump administration s tax cuts and spending increases during a non recessionary period seems virtually unprecedented however it did not boost growth for more than a couple of quarters it failed to lift us productivity spur capital expenditure accelerate wage increases or boost the growth potential nor did it help its major trading partners like canada mexico china or europe yet somehow if germany would just borrow more money and boost public investment emu s problems would be ameliorated it is not immediately evident that if germany jettisoned the black zero and ran a small deficit that it necessarily would aid the periphery in europe let alone the united states it would do little to lift italy out of what appears to be a prolonged stagnation it would do little to counter the strikes and social push back against french president s macron s neoliberal labor and pension reforms for example or help resolve the deadlock following the recent irish election it would not help forge an agreement on the eu s seven year budget or help complete the monetary and banking union in international economic relations the role of creditor and debtor are key traditionally the burden of adjustment is on the debtor think about bretton woods the us harry dexter white took the classic creditor position and the uk john maynard keynes represented the debtors interest in the post war financial order the bancor an international reserve asset that keynes proposed instead of the gold dollar regime and not too dissimilar from boe governor carney s recent proposals of a digital reserve asset that is not a national currency was in the debtors interest and successfully rebuffed or consider the burden of adjustment under bretton woods it was entirely placed on the debtor it to change its policy settings intervene and or accept a devaluation the innovation under the european exchange rate mechanism is that it obligated the creditor surplus countries to bear some of the adjustments too such as intervention the us is no longer the world s creditor which is a significant way that pax americana is unlike pax britannica or pax romana american debt is the coin of the realm even under bretton woods the us insisted on the mark franc and yen appreciation rather than the dollar depreciation as a debtor the us self interest naturally is to blame the creditor and seek their adjustment as a consequence of the combination of us monetary and fiscal policy in the context of the policies being pursued in the other major center global imbalances are rising and the strength of the dollar appears to be one shock absorber with the us having successfully negotiated trade agreements with south korea japan canada mexico and china the trump administration s trade focus is turning to europe complementing the criticism of its european trade practices is the attack on the fiscal stances of a few emu countries yet the us current account deficit is by definition a result of the imbalance between savings and investment what america s right and left have in common is a penchant for externalizing its problems and attributing its challenges to foreign mischief us policymakers and america s chattering class that provide its narrative have begun an offensive the trade confrontation element is well known it needs little comment but to say that in the phase 1 deal with china the us abandoned its traditional emphasis on a rules based settlement in favor of an outcome oriented approach it represents a reversion back to a zero sum approach and strengthens those forces seeking to defect from the free trade regime another front in the offensive is the moral righteous criticism of countries that keep their expenditures aligned with their revenues they are chastised for what historically is understood as fiscal prudence and living within one s means many of these creditor countries in europe have stronger and broader social safety nets than america and in other ways offer a larger basket of goods to its residents and citizens they have higher tax burdens than the us also they have fewer monopolies that facilitate lower consumer prices for essential modern goods internet access health care and higher education in addition they rely considerably less on their penal system for social control surely the driver of the us imbalance with the world is america s own fiscal policy last year a 4 7 budget deficit as a percentage of gdp and this during an economic expansion with historically low levels of unemployment many economists see the deficit rising toward 5 of gdp without addressing the real culprit americans complaining about germany s fiscal policy appear as a self serving way to deflect attention talk about how bad the 2019 german budget surplus of 1 2 of gdp is rather than the us deficit that dwarfs it in both dollar terms and broader impact even if germany boost its spending and even if this raised growth the us current account deficit would not necessarily be reduced one red cent isn t this what has been confirmed in 2019 trade figures the smaller us bilateral trade deficit with china was offset by larger bilateral deficits elsewhere and as economic activity shifted because of tariffs other countries move into us cross hairs like vietnam and malaysia
february 23 2020 10 55 am updated december 04 2021 11 51 pm ist former prime minister of sri lanka ranil wickremesinghe opened the second day of the huddle 2020 the hindu s annual thought conclave at the itc gardenia in bengaluru on sunday the two day event will feature 15 sessions and 32 speakers showcasing some of the best minds from the world of politics business academics sports entertainment and the arts the sessions are designed to be interactive and they take place before an invited audience here is the full text of his keynote speech starting with the mohenjo dara harappa civilization over 4 millennia ago trade and commerce have played a decisive role in the integration of the indian subcontinent and south east asia the mauryan empire became a catalyst for promoting regional trade buddhism removed the restriction on sea travel though kingdoms rose and fell trade remained consistent political alliances were made and broken on the basis of trade in the ninth century the pallavas came to an agreement with the anuradhapura kingdom in sri lankan and the sumatran sri vijaya empire to control trading in the bay of bengal this was challenged by their commercial rivals the chola who defeated the pallavas the sri lankans and finally sri vijaya with the traders travelled the missionaries taking with them the cultures languages and religions of the indian sub continent including hinduism buddhism and jainism during the time of the buddha tapassu and bhallika the first trader converts to buddhism carried the message of the new faith to sri lanka kaundinya a brahman commenced the indianisation of the funan kingdom formed around the mekong river in southeast asia the proliferation of culture alongside trade led to the creation of robust networks a good example of that was the multinational network of the nattukottai chettiars which spanned sri lanka myanmar thailand malaysia singapore and south vietnam until the mid 20th century they had over 1500 businesses in myanmar before world war ii the integrated financial network of the nattukottai chettiars has yet to be matched in the asean and the bimstec countries the total geographical extent of this region was never clearly defined the south and the south east asia are social constructs of recent origin invented mainly by uk and usa for instance the world war ii allies created the south east asia command comprising myanmar malaysia singapore indonesia and thailand to better conduct the war in asia the term south asia was first used by the us state department in 1950 to refer to former british colonies in the indian sub continent thus arose the political construction of two regional groups which now dominates and perhaps divides the bay of bengal region the request for regional groupings in the region have emerged from time to time sixty years ago the leaders of india pakistan sri lanka myanmar and indonesia met in april 1954 for the colombo powers meeting to discuss cooperation within their common region within the indian sub continent an initiative for a regional grouping was first taken up by president ziaur rahman of bangladesh in december 1977 i remember questioning president jayewardene as to whether the proposed association will be a success if we can get india and pakistan to the table keep them talking and avoid a war that will be sufficient he replied finally the heads of the 7 governments of the sub continent countries met in dhaka in 1985 and formed saarc south asian association for regional cooperation from this arose the south asia preferential trade agreement in 1995 followed by the south asia free trade agreement in 2006 however you will agree with me that neither of these agreements has resulted in a meaningful degree of economic integration with an intra regional trade amounting to only 5 of the total trade today both agreements have been unsuccessful in promoting trade in 1997 india and thailand took the initiative to form bimstec the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation the first summit was held only in 2004 and subsequent summits held intermittently bimstec has neither a clear vision nor actionable goals it took 10 years after the first summit to establish the bimstec secretariat which is still underfunded the bimstec trade record on economic integration is also insignificant an agreement in 2004 to conclude an fta by 2006 is still pending on the other hand south east asia started a slow but successful march towards regional integration starting with asean the association of south east asian nations the asean free trade area was established in 1992 the ultimate goal is an asean economic community thereafter the broader constellation of the asia pacific economic community apec was formed in 1989 consisting of 21 member economies including asean china japan republic of korea australia usa canada mexico and chile to promote multilateralism and trade integration in the asia pacific the first asia pacific trade agreement the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership one of the most transformational trade agreements with inter locking commitments was signed by 11 of the asia pacific countries ratification by singapore japan vietnam australia new zealand and mexico has now activated the cpapp the most recent agreement is the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep an asian dominated trade agreement that brings together asean the 3 east asian nations as well as australia and new zealand though shallower than cpatpp it enables china to join the non american members of the cpatpp in a trade integration scheme as a result of these successive agreements tariffs have fallen substantially and remain low services in many sectors have been liberalized and market access conditions substantially improved however overarching all these groupings is the belt and road initiative bri which the hsbc has referred to as globalisations next chapter as you know this china centric multilateral globalisation framework promotes both physical and economic connectivity and thereby significantly increases the economic presence of the chinese current large scale infrastructure projects funded under bri in the south asian region include 3 ports and the 3 economic corridors which connect china with pakistan with nepal and with myanmar the bri projects in our region will thus recast regional connectivity while giving china access to the indian ocean via gwadar and kyaukphyu ports parallel to the bri are the chinese free trade agreements expanding chinese economic partnerships beyond the rcep today the asia pacific is the largest economically integrated region in the world a series of trade agreements covering four continents forms its integration architecture these cover australia new zealand the whole of east asia other than north korea and the entirety of the america pacific coast excluding the usa the bri can be seen as dovetailing into the rcep what remains is for the usa to join the cpatpp which is likely to happen within a decade these agreements also affect us in the subcontinent for example the cpatt reduced tariff on apparel export between members in particular tariff reductions on items such as 1 male trousers hs 620342 2 brassieres hs621210 may lead to exporters like sri lanka and bangladesh losing their staple markets in canada australia and japan to vietnam a fellow member of cpatt unfortunately for us south asia remains the least economically assimilated region in asia and it faces a dilemma to be connected or to be left out of these new and expanding asia pacific configurations of productivity and trade effective integration in trade and security within our region gives us the members the ability to determine our architecture for the next few decades as an integrated regional grouping we will have the strength to negotiate agreements favourable to us with the rcep and other trade groupings we were the first to gain independence during the first phase of british decolonization this combined with our strategic location in the subcontinent enabled our nations to punch above our weight in the global fora yet today we are at the risk of being left out of this productivity network no doubt individual nations can bargain for admission to rcep but becoming an appendage in that forum will mean the loss of voice and weight in this region moreover our region will also lose its identity and the leading position amongst the indian ocean nations the consequences for india will be even greater a loss of prestige and predominance especially if bimstec and saarc loses its economic importance and therefore its political relevance if india loses its clout in this region then it will be a critical setback to its aspirations for a global role therefore all of us require an outcome which enables us to control our destiny consequently regional economic and security integration continues to be the best option as noted earlier our two regional groupings have hitherto made no headway the postponement of the kathmandu saarc summit in 2017 due to heightened indo pakistan tension has brought saarc to a standstill but saarc s stagnation is not entirely due to the uri terrorist attack there have been similar periods of acrimonious relations between members previously and these were not confined to india and pakistan i believe that the core issue holding us back from a regional grouping is the inertia towards regional integration we wish for trade agreements based solely on reducing tariff rates without the required economic restructuring this is an outlook starting from the bombay plan prepared by 8 leading industrialists in pre independent india in 1944 the plan was based on the premise that indigenous industries could not compete in a free market and 7 required government intervention hence the development of a supportive government economic bureaucracy but nearly 80 years later indian companies themselves have proved this to be a false premise by their ability to compete both in the domestic and export markets these inward looking theories and political stances have led to south asia has less than 1 of the net worth of the world s total production of exports while south east asia has 8 you will agree that 1 is a figure that is not sufficient to sustain south asian economic growth the growth in our countries are driven by domestic demand therefore our imports far outstrip our exports leading to increasing trade deficits it is doubtful as to whether this scenario is sustainable in a highly competitive world more to the point an energetic growth scenario is required if the 150 million young people entering the job market in the region by 2030 are to be found employment therefore in the medium term we need to transit into exportled growth to galvanise regional economic development and dynamism it is worthwhile noting that imf reports estimate a productivity boost of 20 over 20 years for india if it accelerates structural reforms including the elimination of trade and investments barrier in such a scenario the spill over effect in bangladesh and sri lanka will possibly see gdp increases by 3 furthermore the total region would contribute 35 to global growth by 2040 at least three recent reports by multilateral agencies have dealt exhaustively with the subject of integrating regional economies and making them competitive these are i south asia ready for take off imf ii a glass half full the promise of regional trade in south asia world bank and iii exports wanted world bank as noted earlier saarc is deadlocked while bimstec is not a substitute for saarc it is nevertheless a starting point for integration furthermore it has immense untapped potential by 2030 the entire bimstec population will exceed 1 7 billion at present bimstec has 3 7 of global trade the current intra regional trade is us 40 billion according to the report reinvigorating bimstec by the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry it is estimated that the actual trade potential of regional integration by bimstec countries could be us 250 billion bimstec also has the added advantage of being a bridge to asean unlike asean the bimstec countries of bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailand are asymmetrical to one another no doubt this could be construed as a hurdle to integration the population the land area and the gdp of india exceeds the combined equivalent of the other countries many times over furthermore economic unevenness between members prevent the uniform restructuring that is required for genuine economic reintegration therefore if regional integration is to succeed in bimstec the initial effort should be confined to a core group of nations which have complementary economies india sri lanka bangladesh and thailand which have a combined gdp of us 3 5 trillion having a deeper assimilation will not be disadvantageous to india in 2018 india had a surplus of us 9 billion in the trading transactions with the other three partners therefore a four pronged economic integration road map eirm is proposed below to accelerate this integration first it is imperative that the four countries come to grips with economic structural reforms traditionally our countries have been averse to competition in south asia the indexes for tariff and non tariff barriers on imports are two to nine times higher than for imports from the rest of the world even the average of cost of trade within south asia is much higher than the corresponding figure for asean and naft amcta therefore any successful regional trade integration has to address the issues of para tariffs and non tariff barriers when our government came into power in 2015 sri lanka had over 6 000 tariffs line effected by para tariff by 2018 we had eliminated over 2000 such tariff lines similarly one third of the south asian inter regional trade is governed by a sensitive list which has to be reduced drastically other pertinent issues to be addressed include those relating to rules of origin and the norms of value addition anti dumping rules and countervailing measures for subsidies and common national regulations the removal of tariffs is a more complex process needing the examination of adjustment costs vs efficiency costs in some sectors domestic stakeholders will require time for adjustment a series of trade adjustment programmes must provide technical and financial assistance for any affected enterprises these sectors can be held up until the end while trade creating sectors and complementary sectors can be given priority to begin with second e commerce exceeds 10 of retail sales in many countries yet it was below 2 in our region commercial internet transactions have been identified as a fast growing sector in world bank s unleashing e commerce for south asian integration a 3 stage regional strategy it is a vital part of this initial road map so as to utilise its potential for regional integration third it may also be important to conceptualise an economic sub region consisting of the five southern indian states and sri lanka which has a population of 300 million people and a combined gdp of over us 500 billion more than sweden an economic sub region including a broad band corridor will optimise the complementarities accelerating regional economic integration kerala is building a new port near trivandrum an adb funded feasibility study is proposing a further expansion of the colombo port with an extension to the north that can make it the largest trans shipment port in the region an offshore financial centre is also planned for colombo therefore the proposed sub region will be attractive for shipping logistics offshore finance it and for maximising on the opportunities of the global value chain a similar sub region is currently being planned between india and bangladesh coronavirus has 11 highlighted the need for a second workshops of the world these two economic sub regions together with thailand are ideally suited for this purpose bangalore as an it centre will also enable the transition to the 4th industrial revolution the fourth leg of the four pronged eirm is tourism a sector which can animate the integration process the bay of bengal is the largest bay in the world dotted with famous cities and scenic beaches including the andaman islands and phuket cruise tourism catering to millions of the emerging asian middle classes is a new commercial opening for the region the bay of bengal has the potential to rival both the caribbean and the mediterranean of course the implementation of the bay of bengal cruise tourism will require detailed planning financing and efficient coordination in addition to bimstec members maldives malaysia and singapore are other cruise destinations that must be invited to join such an initiative this eirm must be i market driven and ii able to provide a deeper integration than the rcep i would suggest that the negotiations for such an agreement be concluded in 2 years if not the talks should be abandoned a signal in that we have failed if we are to succeed a mechanism with the apex body meeting bi annually should be instituted with the mandate of preparing the eirm the apex body should consist of the heads of governments of the 4 participating countries the 12 secretary general of bimstec and the high level head of eirm task force consisting of special representatives appointed by member governments this apex mechanism will need to have a sunset clause leading to the dismantling of the mechanism on a specified date by then provisions will be made for a new permanent mechanism in charge of the eirm once the eirm agreements are signed it should then allow for other members of bimstec and saarc to become signatories to the agreements expanding regional connectivity is a pre requisite for the success of the eirm conversely it is anticipated that the enactment of eirm would accelerate and cement the networks of regional connectivity clearly the pressing need for regional cooperation and connectivity cannot be met by one single country or one single institution we must also take note of the other connectivity enterprises in the region in addition to the chinese belt and road initiative india herself has undertaken two ambitious connectivity projects as you know the kaladan multimodal transport project and the india myanmar thailand trilateral highway japan s quality infrastructure investment qii partnership has also funded a number of projects including i the east west economic corridor ii the thilawa and dawei special economic zone 13 iii the bay of bengal industrial growth belt iv the delhi mumbai and chennai bangalore industrial corridors v the mumbai ahmadabad high speed rail vi the colombo port development the asian development bank has also taken the initiative with the 10 year south asia sub regional economic cooperation programme for infrastructure which is anticipated to a strengthen multimodal cross border transport networks b improve trade facilitation and c enhance electricity trading however it must be recognised that the present bimstec secretariat is too bureaucratic understaffed and not equipped for monitoring this type of undertakings therefore the secretariat will have to be restructured and upgraded with the head of the secretariat being equivalent to ministerial level the secretariat could then be in a position to coordinate and fast track the connectivity plans and projects within bimstec there is no doubt that asia s huge appetite for connectivity and related infrastructure merges with the critical issue of asian security this has resulted in the polarization of two conceptualisations of security strategies for the asian region one is centred on bri china s asia for asians strategy and the pla far sea forces concept is based on a network of partnerships which is poised to tilt the balance of power in asia the usa and its allies have responded to this with the indo pacific and the quad in an attempt to safeguard the existing balance of power consequently today the asia pacific has to contend somewhat paradoxically with a security architecture linked to usa and an economic architecture involving china unlike the asia pacific whose security structure has been based on military alliances our region has avoided such alliances consequently the security structure of the asia pacific cannot be duplicated in the indian ocean moreover there are difference of opinion as to the exact definition and demarcation of the indo pacific the us concept of the indo pacific extend only up to the west coast of the indian sub continent in contrast our countries stand by the iora definition of the indian ocean and envisage an indo pacific starting from east africa to the pacific coast of the americas when it comes to security a major source of concern to the littoral states of the indian ocean is the increasing presence of naval ships belonging to outside stakeholders the sea lines of communication in the indian ocean the lifelines of global commerce must be open for peaceful use the indian prime minister narendra modi is advocating an open and inclusive indo pacific sri lanka has taken the initiative in promoting a code of conduct on the freedom of navigation in the indian ocean based on unclos the united nations convention on the law of the sea we have also proposed the need to formulate an enforcement machinery these proposals include the 15 safeguarding of undersea cables a lifeline as vital as the sea lanes the first 1 5 diplomatic track meeting was held in colombo on 11 october 2018 on the whole there is a need to avoid security polarization within our region security cooperation need to be based on agreed threats within the region rather than political posturing the mounting multi dimensional regional trade arising from economic integration should not be thwarted by war or other security disruptions consequently terrorism piracy human smuggling narcotics and the presence of non state actors are recognised as regional threats and have become the basis for security cooperation in the region progress has already been made on security coordination in the bay of bengal bimstec members have agreed to cooperate on the bimstec convention on cooperation in combating international terrorism transnational organised crime and illicit drug trafficking and have established a joint working group however to become effective bimstec members must overcome their indifferences and ratify the convention in addition to the convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters maritime security has also been added to the agenda of the bimstec national security chiefs annual meetings india has also hosted the first bimstec military exercise on boosting inter operationality amongst intranational forces to contain terrorism another security initiative the trilateral maritime security cooperation between india sri lanka and maldives provide joint cooperation in patrolling the exclusive economic zone and combating piracy the bay of bengal littoral states have also participated in the milan naval exercises hosted by the indian navy the biennial indian ocean naval symposium and the annual galle dialogue also provide opportunities for navy chiefs of bimstec and saarc littoral states to discuss maritime security threats at least the building blocks for regional security in bimstec are falling in to place another security initiative the trilateral maritime security cooperation between india sri lanka and maldives provide joint cooperation in patrolling the exclusive economic zone and combating piracy the bay of bengal littoral states have also participated in the milan naval exercises hosted by the indian navy the biennial indian ocean naval symposium and the annual galle dialogue also provide opportunities for navy chiefs of bimstec and saarc littoral states to discuss maritime security threats at least the building blocks for regional security in bimstec are falling in to place nevertheless saarc is not fully functional and will not be so until the summit meetings are held moreover the indo pakistan tensions have led to our region being identified as a possible site for nuclear conflict this itself indicates the urgent necessity to restore normalcy hence the indo pakistan disputes affecting the saarc though a bilateral issue need to be resolved by the two countries at a level which permits the summits to take place this also requires solutions to the underlying issues of terrorism including cross border terrorism here we must reflect on how economic integration in the asia and pacific has acted as a disincentive for conflict the outstanding issues are still retained 17 within the present architectures available for example our region should follow a similar approach only regional integration both economic and security leading to a linkage with the existing asia pacific network will enable us to create rapid economic growth to escape the middle income trap and lead us to prosperity this will also make us the first economically integrated region in the indian ocean hence we will be able to take leadership in promoting trade integration in the indian ocean and ensure security of the sea lines of communications in conclusion then let us be bold in conceptualising one vast global productivity and connectivity network from east africa to the shores of the pacific region of the americas we have the possibility of becoming the 4th global trading bloc and increasing our voice and weight in the global fora we must not miss it
among progressives concerned about climate change few issues provoke as much anger as the knowledge that governments continue to subsidize fossil fuels according to the international monetary fund imf in 2017 these subsidies totaled 5 2 trillion annually don t governments realize that fossil fuels are cooking the planet the scientific community says we are in a desperate race against time but the coal oil and gas companies apparently still have their noses deeply in the public trough most policy elites think fossil fuel subsidies should go a decade ago group of twenty g20 leaders committed to rationalize and phase out government support for coal oil and gas a decision supported by major institutions like the imf and the world trade organization wto at a summit in may 2019 u n secretary general antónio guterres said taxpayers money was being used to boost hurricanes to spread droughts to melt glaciers to bleach corals in one word to destroy the world these are fighting words but there is good reason to be wary of the global elite s call for subsidy reform this call is framed in ways that seek to legitimize and universalize neoliberal approaches to energy transition activists may think so what if it gets rid of subsidies what s the problem but there is a real risk that the consolidation of neoliberal policy will produce outcomes that are considerably worse than the outcomes produced by fossil fuel subsidies d day for the climate subsidy reform is routinely described as a major mitigation option in other words if countries are serious about reaching emissions reductions targets then it should be a top priority this is because the argument goes subsidies stimulate additional fossil fuel production and consumption lead to carbon lock in e g new power plants that will burn coal and gas for decades distort energy markets and make it harder for clean energy to compete some studies suggest that the removal of subsidies would lead to substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions ghgs one concluded that this could equal a quarter of the combined emission reductions proposed by countries under the paris agreement using 2015 s global emissions and pollution levels as a reference a recent imf study concluded that if there had been no subsidies in place at all during that year emissions could have been reduced by 28 percent a recent study by the international institute for sustainable development iisd concluded money supporting fossil fuels should be redirected toward supporting renewable energy noting that 70 percent of the growth in energy demand in 2018 was met by fossil fuels the authors urged governments to expedite a subsidies swap in order to accelerate the energy transition excited by this thought the guardian s damien carrington recently claimed just 10 30 percent of the fossil fuel subsidies would pay for a global transition to clean energy with numbers such as these flying around it s no surprise that environmental groups have made subsidies a major target and getting rid of them is seen as a potential d day for the climate a watershed moment in the war between clean and dirty energy know your zombies in order to assess these claims first we need to recognize the difference between producer subsidies and consumer subsidies producer subsidies may take the form of subsidized inputs preferential tax treatment and direct budget transfers straight up corporate welfare for fossil fuel companies for example in 2015 when global oil prices were low the u k government reduced the highest tax rate on north sea oil production from 80 percent to 68 percent in order to keep oil operations in the black according to imf and organisation for economic co operation and development oecd data producer subsidies in 2015 may have totaled some 17 9 billion in which case they don t amount to much some non governmental organization ngo reports say g20 producer subsidies are as high as 70 billion more than 70 percent of which goes to oil and gas the same report adds 88 billion in public financing from majority government owned banks in fact if all public support for or investment in fossil fuels is factored in the total could reach 444 billion these higher producer subsidy estimates have prompted claims from progressive ngos that a significant amount of new fossil fuel production would have been uneconomical if not for government subsidies thus the term zombie energy but none of these add ons are subsidies as typically understood public banks for example are also major investors in renewable energy and these investments are packaged in ways that guarantee profit for renewable energy companies which means these investments are also subsidizing producers and while state owned companies invested 286 billion in fossil fuels during 2013 2014 it s a bit of a stretch to assert that public investment to meet energy needs is the same as a subsidy mind the gap either way most fossil fuel subsidies are not producer subsidies they are consumer subsidies these can be pre tax or post tax pre tax consumer subsidies arise when the price paid by consumers is below the cost of supplying the energy oecd international energy agency iea and imf estimates for global pre tax subsidies amounted to 305 billion in 2017 pre tax consumer subsidies are calculated based on the difference between an international benchmark price for coal gas and oil products like gasoline or kerosene and the actual retail price paid by consumers according to the imf pre tax consumer subsidies measure the degree of underpricing so if the venezuelan government decides to sell gasoline to venezuelans at say 1 00 per liter below the international benchmark unit price that dollar becomes a subsidy if algeria sells gas for cooking or heating to algerians at 20 cents per therm below the benchmark price that 20 cents is also a subsidy if south africa discounts electricity for some households to ensure affordable power the discount below what the imf calls the efficient price also counts as a subsidy this method of calculation is very controversial poorer energy producing countries argue that anything below the actual cost of producing the product can be legitimately described as a subsidy if calculated in this way the cost based subsidies figure will be lower than the imf s 305 billion estimate by a considerable margin but the imf insists that the benchmark price in other words the level at which coal oil and gas can be sold on global markets should determine how subsidies are calculated this may sound like a minor detail but it carries huge political and ideological significance if energy is produced for human development then actual costs are paramount if energy is produced to maximize profit then the global selling price is what really matters apparitional subsidies added together these numbers still don t begin to approach the imf s 5 2 trillion figure in fact if we stick to imf data pre tax producer and consumer subsidies amount to just 6 percent of the 5 2 trillion and that s without challenging the imf s controversial benchmark price calculation this is where the post tax consumer subsidies come in these post tax subsidies reflect the difference between end use prices and what consumers would pay if the price of negative externalities were included local air pollution effects of climate change traffic congestion and road accidents and other health impacts why is it called a post tax subsidy the tax in this instance is a corrective or pigouvian tax as an imf working paper describes it when the consumption of a good generates an external cost to society then efficient pricing requires that consumers face a price that reflects this cost this is an attempt to put a dollar figure on the environmental and other damages that result from lighting the cooking stove taking a tuk tuk three wheeled taxi or colectivo bus to work or watching tv therefore if someone dies of a cardiopulmonary condition as a result of the emissions or pollution related activities consumers should pay the value of that person s lost productive potential in other words roughly 94 percent of the imf s 5 2 trillion in fossil fuel subsidies exists only in theory these subsidies cannot be removed or phased out because there s nothing there post tax subsidies perhaps better described as apparitional subsidies would only materialize as real money if the externalities pollution and damage to health for example were actually paid for but is this remotely likely according to one of the imf s chief subsidy wonks david coady full payment would mean at the global level the price of coal petroleum products natural gas and electricity would increase by around 200 percent 50 percent 45 percent and 70 percent respectively this notes coady raises important issues regarding what might be done to address the challenges of implementing energy price reform in practice green structural adjustment reading the imf oecd and similar reports on subsidies it s hard not to conclude that the calculations are being inflated and then weaponized to serve a purpose and the purpose is not primarily to pressure fossil fuel interests rather it is to strengthen the dominant neoliberal anti government discourse subsidy reform provides a green protective blanket for the same anti public supply side and socially regressive structural adjustment agenda that was promoted so aggressively by these same institutions in the 1980s and 1990s across the global south if the dollar value of subsidies has indeed been inflated for political and ideological purposes then the same can be said of the emissions reductions estimates that derive from them the imf maintains that if users paid the full price for fossil based energy consumption would fall and a more efficient use of energy would eventually follow but the relationship between prices fossil fuel use and emissions reductions is based on what economists call elasticities research has shown that the price demand ratio can be quite pronounced when consumers have alternative energy options but when alternatives don t exist which is often the case increases in prices produce a low to moderate reduction in demand according to the imf consistent country level models of how fossil fuel use responds to price reform are not yet available on a wide scale in other words the imf s assertion that getting energy prices right will dramatically curtail energy use is politically convenient but it is not always supported by the data neoliberal institutions have consistently argued that decarbonization liberalization and privatization are inextricably connected therefore addressing climate change is contingent upon the consolidation of neoliberal energy policy there is always no alternative but if climate concerns were paramount the neoliberal institutions would admit that their green growth policies have been a monumental failure mexico provides a good example of this green structural adjustment a review team convened by g20 finance ministers and the oecd examined the energy reform measures pursued from 2012 to 2016 by the neoliberal and hugely unpopular government of peña nieto subsidies for gas and electricity were removed and parts of the energy sector have been privatized praising the government for its remarkable accomplishment the review team s november 2017 report noted the country s opening up of its markets to foreign producers and distributors has been accompanied by the raising of consumer prices for transport fuels and the establishment of higher levels of excise taxes plus the introduction of the carbon excise tax a series of incremental increases in the price of gasoline over several years was capped by a 20 percent increase in january 2017 this led to human road blockades strikes and nation wide protests but the increase in prices has done little to alter mexico s dramatic rise in energy use mexico s gas consumption for power generation has almost tripled since 2000 enabled by the expanded availability of gas from the united states due to fracking vehicle ownership has risen dramatically while notes the iea the public transport fleet is ageing and polluting in mexico and elsewhere subsidy reform is being used as a political water cannon to flush the state out of the way the desired effect of the reform is to raise the price of energy getting prices right creates space for profit making and incentivizes private investment but its impact on emissions levels has been barely noticeable shock therapy 2 0 it remains the case that removing subsidies more accurately imposing higher prices on fossil fuels would hurt a lot of ordinary people especially in poorer countries it would exacerbate global inequalities as a share of gross domestic product gdp the 20 countries with the highest pre tax consumer subsidies are all in the global south they include iran venezuela algeria bolivia indonesia and pakistan one study advocating subsidy reform suggests the removal of subsidies translates into an increase of the fossil fuel prices contributing to a generalized contraction of domestic economic activity of course triggering a deep recession and inducing poverty is one way of reducing emissions as billions of people who have found themselves on the receiving end of imf shock therapy can attest as for the 94 percent apparitional subsidies if these were ever to materialize as money the global south would be contributing more than two thirds of the total this is because one of the legacies of the fight against colonialism was for nation states to provide energy at prices that could advance human and national development objectives countries of the north no longer need to do this because they are so rich that energy subsidies are no longer needed but these same rich countries are responsible for 70 of carbon in the atmosphere and currently warming the planet so called cumulative co2 they made themselves wealthy but paid nothing for the emissions they created along the way for activists in the north making fossil fuel subsidies a key political target is a mistake it buys into the imf s obsession with getting energy prices right which targets state ownership and regulation of prices such an approach may lead to a more judicious use of energy but it won t address the mammoth challenges involved in transitioning away from fossil fuels controlling and reducing unnecessary economic activity or reducing emissions is expeditiously as possible the problem is fossil fuel dependency not underpriced energy raising the price without alternative forms of low carbon energy available for all will not produce the kind of emissions reductions the world needs this does not mean that progressive unions and the left should support subsidies for fossil fuels especially when the beneficiaries are large for profit industrial users or billionaire lamborghini owners cruising the strips in riyadh or shanghai but there is a need to be aware of what the imf and the subsidy reform organizations are proposing and what these proposals might mean for workers and ordinary people especially in the global south before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of publishing truthout has been a stalwart independent news

key economic releases and events the week ended on a more anxious note after all the optimism a week earlier when investors were lauding the decelerating new coronavirus cases there s still optimism that the corner has been turned but now it s the corporate side that s spooking investors this week apple and others were quick to warn about the economic consequences of the last month although few details were given at the time more will likely follow in the coming weeks which may continue to spoil the party for investors all too used to records at this point it s election year in the us and while we re all already looking to november we first have to find out who us president trump is going to be facing first on tuesday the candidates will go head to head once again and mike bloomberg will be hoping to come away with a few more plaudits this time country uk the uk political scene was quiet this week with mps on recess giving the rest of us a break they all return next week as labour leadership hopefuls take to the stage to convince the rest of us they can t do any worse than corbyn data this week brought some reprieve for the bank of england as inflation bounced back more impressively than expected traders weren t too deterred though and continue to price in a 60 chance of a rate cut this year which seems a little hopeful and pointless to me us michael bloomberg arrived fashionably late to the party this week and his entrance was reportedly far from extraordinary other candidates rounded on him and his billions most notably bernie sanders who is looking like a strong contender at this stage bloomberg has plenty left in the bank though and his first appearance may not have been one to remember but you don t become a billionaire and new york mayor by accident the democratic party may be the biggest thing standing between him and the white house china the hot topic is still covid 19 and its impact for asia and the global economy as a whole we ve now been through two iterations of the methodology for reporting the number of cases which now on the face of it appear to be slowing even though a bit of scepticism is creeping in among observers we are waiting for who comments on the latest change meantime asia is responding with economic stimulus measures and rate cuts china dropped its loan prime rate on thursday on the back of earlier cuts to its medium term lending facility mlf china and singapore have laid out stimulus measures to mitigate the economic impact of the virus anecdotal evidence out of china shows small private companies cutting wages delaying salary payments or even not paying staff at all we can expect more of these kind of reports in coming weeks data takes a backseat under these circumstances but for the record next week we have retail sales data and industrial production for january with the pmis for february on the last day of the month saturday a reversal in the slowdown of the number of new cases would take the edge off risk appetite capping the current equity rally at least temporarily and forcing flows into the usual safe havens of gold the yen swiss franc the us dollar and us treasuries it would again be negative for oil and industrial metals hong kong hurt by the protests and now covid 19 the hong kong economy is falling apart with tourist arrival collapsing and hotels with only 25 occupancy we see q4 gdp numbers next wednesday and they are unlikely to be good the economy is already in technical recession and facing the prospect of a third quarterly contraction in a row there haven t been any announcements of fiscal stimulus measures yet the hong kong 33 index is holding up well as is the local dollar despite the coronavirus effect and a firmer us dollar weak gdp data are likely to pressure local equities and could pull usd hkd back up to the middle of its trading band australia thursday s employment report for january showed an uptick in unemployment but strong jobs creation given the rba s focus on unemployment the higher rate saw australian yields lower and the aussie under pressure the focus now is on a dovish rba which could turn at any moment and whilst this in place will continue to pressure the aussie japan q4 gdp data came in worse than expected showing the first quarterly contraction in a year which was blamed on the covid 19 threat the economic toll is mounting not to mention the bad news from the cruise ship quarantined off japan data next week includes industrial production retail trade and unemployment with no end to the covid 19 situation in sight japan markets could trade negatively with the yen in demand if we see another spike in cases singapore singapore s close links with china have brought the city state to the forefront of coronavirus news and this week s budget introduced measures to mitigate the economic impact the wider budget deficit is not an issue for its aaa rating said fitch the mas has already said there is room within the neer trading band to ease policy and we may see an inter meeting adjustment given the next policy meeting is not scheduled until april the singapore dollar weakened to the lowest level since may 2017 versus the us dollar this week an early policy easing amid rising virus cases would pressure the sgd further market usd the us dollar index came within touching distance of 100 on thursday spurred on in recent weeks by everything from safe haven flows to the outperformance of the us whatever is happening dollar is king it s fallen just short of that psychological barrier though at the first time of asking but still finds itself at a near three year high oil it s been another good week for oil prices but the rally quickly ran out of gas after the inventory data on thursday the report gave brent one final kick higher before the profit taking kicked in at 60 and since then its been in paring mode the more downbeat end to the week isn t helping with crude slipping more than 1 on friday oil prices have been heavily punished throughout the outbreak though so if we really are in containment mode traders may become more interested in the dips once again gold gold is heading for its best week since august as it capitalized on growing insecurity in the stock market to charge through its 1 600 resistance and burst higher the yellow metal is now testing 1 650 and packing a punch with investors growing ever more fearful about the corporate fallout of the coronavirus the path of least resistance for gold looks upwards it s been quite a strong week though so a little profit taking in the near term wouldn t be outrageous with 1 650 possibly offering a logical zone for this bitcoin i m not sure bitcoin enthusiasts even know if it s a safe haven at this point but regardless it s hovering around 10 000 and as long it in around or being linked to the news in any way it seems capable of finding a reason to rally it s consolidated over the last couple of weeks but there s no major signs of weakness there at the moment the halving in may could keep prices elevated in the coming months

statistics are like lawyers you can find one to support your position no matter how ridiculous as the final part of an ongoing series on affordability this article looks into the biggest elephant in the room statistics that have been abused by every federal and state administration for the past 40 years about the cost of living what the heck is going on trying to apply the rules of finance to the world today is like trying to apply the rule of law to bill barr s justice department it makes your head hurt because it s disconnected from reality tesla a company that has annual earnings of about 24 8 billion is valued by the market as a 145 billion company even though it does not make a profit meanwhile general motors has annual revenues of about 137 billion and made 8 1 billion net profit and is valued by the market as a 49 6 billion company granted tesla s growth rate is currently projected to be three times that of gm s but when tesla gets as big as gm it s not going to be growing that fast anymore tesla is presently valued at more than honda ford and general motors combined this defies common sense what ever happened to the efficient market theory now consider that the u s federal reserve is incessantly talking about easing interest rates and being ready to flood the markets with cash quantitative easing at the slightest sign of economic weakness at a time when all the major stock market averages are making all time highs almost dialy this has never happened before in the history of modern finance and it is enabling bad actors in the markets propping up insolvent zombie companies that have no business continuing to exist and encouraging wild speculation in stock and bond markets around the world what has also never happened is that banks have been tightening lending standards for individuals even as the federal government is flooding them with cash this is leading to the public increasing savings from their paychecks even though interest rates are going down while pundits spin elaborate theories about all of this one thing is glaringly obvious this represents a climate of uncertainty and fear at a time when the government is telling us there s nothing to fear someone has it wrong as fascinating as all this might be you may be asking what does any of this have to do with affordability and the average person being able to afford to live a middle class lifestyle the answer is it s all symptomatic of an economy that our government has been jerry rigging for decades to persuade the public into accepting what might be called modern indentured servitude a life that is the equivalent of being a debt mule to feed an economic system based on a lust for unlimited consumption that rewards those who control assets over those who contribute labor it s a system in which stock market valuations are now directly tied to many other major systemic financial problems such as unfunded pension obligations that stand to bankrupt more and more american cities in the next major downturn it s a system that is increasingly brittle perhaps that is what the fed is so worried about affordability and personal bankruptcies amidst our record breaking prosperity recent harvard university study reports that medical expenses account for 62 of bankruptcies out of these 78 of bankruptcy filers had medical insurance with rising health coverage costs and co pays a serious hospitalization can cause severe debt once savings has been exhausted the only option left to deal with medical bills may be bankruptcy the february 14 2020 edition the guardian notes that millions of americans can t afford the prescription drugs they require to survive forcing them into bankruptcy trips to mexico or cutting off utilities in a recent article published in the atlantic the great affordability crisis breaking america author annie lowrey contends that our country s decreasing affordability is a consequence of the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis regarding the past ten years she writes this crisis involved not just what families earned but the other half of the ledger too how they spent their earnings in one of the best decades the american economy has ever recorded families were bled dry by landlords hospital administrators university bursars and child care centers for millions a roaring economy felt precarious or downright terrible viewing the economy through a cost of living paradigm helps explain why roughly two in five american adults would struggle to come up with 400 in an emergency so many years after the great recession ended it helps explain why one in five adults is unable to pay the current month s bills in full it demonstrates why a surprise furnace repair bill parking ticket court fee or medical expense remains ruinous for so many american families despite all the wealth this country has generated fully one in three households is classified as financially fragile there s little doubt that she is correct about some of the reasons for rising wealth inequality and much of this has been used to reinforce the political arguments behind the removal of local control of planning and zoning laws in california yet as compelling as her article often is it devolves into a superficial analysis that doesn t really get to the why of it all we need to ask ourselves how can it be that according to private sector reporting almost half of our households are living on the edge have only 400 in emergency savings when according to federal government statistics wages are going up unemployment is at an all time low and the number of families living in poverty is going down how does one reconcile claims that u s families are steadily being lifted out of poverty from roughly 20 in 1963 to 12 today according to the u s census and 20 to as low as 3 by conservative think tanks while simple inflation adjusted economic analysis shows that the average wage earner is making less than they did 40 years ago because inflation has been steadily eating away at the value of those earnings this suggests that the rich man poor man divide is not as simple as being just about education lack of equal opportunity tax laws race or other issues perhaps it s more deeply embedded in the statistical data upon which our financial and fiscal policies are based what if over the past 40 years the data that these claims are based on are the result of intentional manipulation of financial facts to make things look better than they are to the point that the statistics themselves are now a major part of the affordability problem if this is true it would explain a great deal about the affordability crisis and tell us that the u s economy and its prosperity are not anywhere near as healthy as everyone wants you to believe what is poverty since 2012 the robin hood foundation a new york based nonprofit has been working with the columbia university center on poverty and social policy to assess poverty in new york city their findings have been that although one out of five people experienced poverty in 2018 one in three experienced what they called material hardship this means that they could not afford necessities such as food rent or medical care studies like these suggest that across the country almost half of american families fall into this on the edge of poverty category even though according to government statistical measures they are doing fine the government s published statistics based on the u s census bureau s estimates say that the u s poverty rate is only 12 3 39 7 million families for 2020 the u s government has set the poverty level for a household of four as an annual income of 26 200 12 760 for an individual that equates to making 13 01 per hour working a 40 hour work week for a year it means that any family making more than that is not statistically poor and more importantly ineligible for a raise or certain types of government assistance does anyone honestly believe that a family of four making 27 000 per year officially not in poverty can even survive on that annual income particularly if they live in any of our country s major metropolitan areas the truth is that the government wants to keep the annual income threshold for poverty as low as possible it allows them to pay out less in poverty assistance programs make the federal deficit look lower and a lot more the cpi when questioned about why the official poverty level is set so low the government s argument is that the poverty figures are backed up by decades of data that comprise the consumer price index cpi the federal reserve keeps detailed records of annual inflation rates dating back more than one hundred years which it uses to make its case that they are faithfully keeping up with inflation to help american families make ends meet the federal poverty thresholds are updated every year to reflect changes in the annual average cpi the cpi is a statistical inflation calculation that drives numerous public benefits payments everything from social security payments to public assistance programs and contractual wage and benefit increases for a wide variety of employees public and private according to the cpi in 1980 the u s government s poverty threshold for a non farm family of four persons was 8 414 using the 2020 number of 26 200 this means the u s government believes that based on the cpi the costs of living have only risen approximately 310 since 1980 does anyone actually believe that the cost of necessities has only risen 310 since 1980 real data a common sense analysis of the data indicates that the cpi has been under calculating the overall cost of living by a lot for a very long time let s consider some common sense examples family expenses compared to cpi 1980 to 2020 housing when it comes to housing affordability a lot of people will find it surprising that despite all the noise being made by the media and yimby housing advocates about the housing crisis one of the only things that actually remains close to the u s government s guidelines 310 inflation since 1980 is the cost of rental housing and yes even in san francisco between 1980 and 2020 the average cost of renting a 2 bedroom apartment in san francisco went up about 321 from about 1 400 per month to 4 500 per month today and it s actually been going down in the past 12 months however the cost of housing ownership is a completely different story the average cost of purchasing a home in san francisco in 1980 was roughly 175 000 today it s closer to 1 3 million that s an increase of approximately 800 consider that in a major job center like san francisco or new york city where the average two bedroom apartment rent is about 4 500 per month the annual housing expenditure of a family of four living equates to earning 54 000 per year in after tax income this means that per federal guidelines a family of four that is not statistically in poverty making 27 000 per year needs to spend 200 of their total annual income just on rent even if they lived in the lowest rental cost neighborhood in all of san francisco downtown with the average monthly rent of 2 932 per month 35 184 per year they d need to spend 150 of their annual income just for housing how is that family of four not magnitudes beyond being poor and how do they pay for anything else they need in their lives it s true there s nothing that says the government has to ensure that everyone can live in san francisco but clearly our government s methodologies to arrive at the inflation in housing costs are nonsensical healthcare looking at healthcare in 1980 according to a study by the kaiser family foundation the average annual healthcare cost using medicare expenditures as a comparative measure was about 1 108 per person today it s close to 12 800 that s an increase of over 1 000 and that doesn t look at insurance costs which are going even faster as noted in the rising cost of health care by year and its causes in 2017 u s health care costs were 3 5 trillion that makes health care one of the country s largest industries it equals 17 9 of gross domestic product in comparison health care cost 27 2 billion in 1960 just 5 of gdp that translates to an annual health care cost of 10 739 per person in 2017 versus just 146 per person in 1960 health care costs have risen faster than the average annual income college education in 1980 according to the department of education the average annual cost of tuition room and board and fees at a four year post secondary institution was 9 438 today that cost is approximately 36 000 per year that s an increase of 380 not too much more than the cpi assumptions however at the more desirable colleges and universities the annual cost is close to double that amount an increase of about 700 which helps explain why total student debt has reached almost 1 5 trillion so if the truth about the rise in the cost of living is so much greater than the government says it is why is the cpi so far off the cpi re examined since the 1970s there has been nothing more feared by the government than inflation that last time inflation reared its ugly head it took the federal reserve raising the prime rate to 18 to bring it to a halt but the powers that be have since discovered that no inflation is also a bad thing because inflation serves a valuable political purpose it can hide a lot of bad public policy and bad financial decisions politically motivated giveaways and bailouts to buy voter support as a result the cpi has become highly politicized and has been tinkered with over the past 40 years to make things appear to be better than they are this has been used to justify tax cuts for the wealthy pile new taxes and fees on the middle class reduce public assistance programs balance the budget and whatever else lawmakers need in a private study by cornerstone wealth management in 2011 it notes that starting in 1983 the government significantly changed the way it calculates cpi and the government has continued to make major changes since that time such as comparing their estimates of basic costs of necessities such as utilities less often on an 8 year cycle versus a 4 year cycle changing how they measure healthcare costs to follow government bureaucrat s estimates the national association of insurance commissioners rather than actual pricing and a long list of other changes in the study examining the period from 1983 to 2011 the authors note john williams at shadow government statistics estimates that if we calculated inflation today the same way we did during carter s administration cpi would be closer to 10 rather than the 1 5 calculated as of 12 31 10 by the government that s a big difference just three of the cpi changes they considered in this study were 1 the removal of actual home prices and the use of something called the owner s equivalent rent a government estimate instead 2 the introduction of something called hedonics which stopped using the actual costs of goods and instead used a formula to estimate a product s value related to technological advances i e per moore s law which dramatically lowered the costs of many 21st century necessities smartphones computers internet connections etc and 3 the introduction of the concept of product substitutions which is a guesstimated assumption that as the price of products goes up consumers will simply substitute the thing they need with something cheaper tell me how does that work with nutritious food and clothing and prescription medicine for your kids this trend to use formulas and unsubstantiated assumptions instead of actual prices has now moved the cpi into the realm of wishful thinking and politicized goal fulfillment rather than being a real gauge of inflation but as you can see these new and improved methods have huge political benefits if you want to keep government costs down and keep the public thinking that everything is fine so they ll pay their taxes and vote for new bond measures and keep believing that prosperity is just around the corner if they just keep consuming more and keep taking on more and more unsustainable debt the way the government itself is doing perhaps the most absurd abuse of the cpi is what the federal reserve is doing right now claiming that the cpi which they know full well is being managed to appear much lower than it actually is represents an excuse to continue to rain money on financial markets under the premise that inflation actually needs to be higher what this means that while the government is working to artificially decrease the cpi to keep it far below actual costs to cook the books the federal reserve wants to cut interest rates to increase inflation above that artificially low level this is insanity meanwhile 70 millions baby boomers heading into retirement are finding that the savings that they were told to accumulate all their lives are worthless 1 million in a safe savings account pays out 10 000 per year no wonder personal debt is at an all time high in the hands of politicians the cpi the most closely watched measure of inflation has become the tool of choice to manipulate the appearance of inflation they have done this to the point that what cpi now measures if you can even call it that bears little resemblance to what it measured 40 years ago this leads one to wonder just how much current inflation is being understated as noted by michael lebowitz and lance roberts in their analysis mmt sounds great in theory but prior to 1998 inflation was measured on a basket of goods however during the clinton administration the boskin commission was brought in to recalculate how inflation was measured their objective was simple lower the rate of inflation to reduce the amount of money being paid out since then inflation measures have been tortured mangled and abused to the point where it scarcely equates to the inflation that consumers deal with in reality this of course has had a profound impact on how we measure profits success growth entitlements public programs the correct level of interest rates and affordability and not for the better the federal government s intentional perversion of cpi promotes a systemic mismatch between what taxpayers pay into benefits programs such as medicare and what the government pays out to taxpayers as benefits such as social security for example this year s social security benefits will rise by just 1 6 based on cpi while the cost of medicare part b insurance that the government charges taxpayers will rise by 6 7 heads they win tails you lose this may answer the tesla valuation conundrum ironically by manipulating the cpi to mask real inflation changes in every aspect of the real world it s possible that today the valuations on the major stock exchanges may be the only thing that reflecting rapidly rising inflation all this is being subsidized by the government s relentless debauching of our currency the money supply is currently growing not because of economic growth and demand as it should but simply due to the demand for money to speculate do stock buy backs and a long list of other non productive capital wasting uses which is a whole other story all this explains why amidst all our supposed record breaking prosperity the cost living for middle class families is so out of whack with what the government is assuring us it is the cold hard facts if the government were to come clean about the real costs of living the impacts would result in the biggest financial earthquake we ve ever seen and kicking that can down the road with endless money printing quantitative easing endless manipulation of data pushing interest rates to move into negative territory and other such shenanigans will only ensure that the magnitude of that earthquake will someday be greater today decreasing affordability and the simultaneous reductions in public services are a national problem and this is not limited to high priced cities the cold hard facts are that more and more american families are falling further and further into unacknowledged poverty this might explain another troubling statistic while everyone is arguing about the need for affordable housing hundreds of towns and cities across the country are shrinking in population people are leaving and these towns and cities are actively tearing down housing even though it is more expensive for residents to move to and live in a major metropolitan area even after adjustments relative to wages paid this phenomena is happening because in these cities there is no longer enough critical mass of wealth and no longer a thriving middle class to create jobs our nation s affordability crisis is the direct result of a hollowing out of our society facilitated and under written by 40 years of the big con a statistical lie that

bloomberg gianni sichel has been busy visiting customers in downtown santiago to tell them that his recycling trucks will collect waste only before dawn in march at that hour they can best avoid roadblocks bendito residuo or holy waste is still reeling after student protests over a subway fare increase last year metastasized into broader fury against chile s income inequality and social injustice sichel s organic waste recycling plant north of santiago was firebombed in december a casualty of an undifferentiated wave of violence against businesses it took more than 20 firetrucks to control the blaze today the plant operates at only 20 capacity four months ago nobody knew what was going to happen he said this time we don t want to be caught off guard police have already identified 25 different calls for marches next month according to reports in local newspapers and chile s business people investors government and political parties are bracing themselves for renewed protests after a southern hemisphere summer lull chileans typically take vacations in january and february government offices close congress is out of session and campuses are largely empty since october south america s richest country has been grappling with the biggest unrest since the dictatorship of augusto pinochet which ended in 1990 violent clashes between police and protesters left about 30 dead at least 3 800 wounded and 20 000 arrested the national human rights institute received more than 1 800 accusations of abuse students initially were enraged by the fare increase and argued that it was emblematic of a government that stifles its citizens while being hopelessly in thrall to business they were joined in the streets by a broad swath of chilean society amid plummeting popularity the government promised reforms to pensions health taxes and a boost to wages it also agreed on an april vote about replacing the pinochet era constitution with one that would make it easier to pass laws and reduce the power of the private sector but now students are returning to campuses and the nation is waiting to see if the promised changes will keep the peace diego diaz a 21 year old law student at the universidad de chile who joined protests from their beginning said more demonstrations are inevitable it is naive to believe that nothing will happen in march he said it is evil and perverse to want everything to go back to normal gloria de la fuente political scientist and head of center left think tank fundacion chile 21 said when people lose trust in institutions as we have seen happen in chile violence appears as an alternative whatever march brings citizens are getting ready christian eblen 30 owns a medical supply and clothing store four blocks from plaza italia the square in santiago where many protests have erupted he is concerned about violence as march is typically his best month when medical students begin a new academic year and need scrubs and surgical caps eblen is trying to increase online sales even offering free deliveries in case he has to suddenly close his store he also moved most of his merchandise far from the protests and bought fire and theft insurance my warehouse has better security in case in there s an increase of looting he said the government and security forces also are preparing after officers fired rubber pellets straight at protesters last october causing more than 400 eye wounds the local police called carabineros are retraining 2 600 members in protest control methods and human rights they re also acquiring new armored cars drones and body cameras as well as trying to improve their intelligence services the government will respect human rights spokeswoman karla rubilar said in a radio interview we are working on better preparing our police forces on human rights issues something we know has been weak during the past months but also on new mechanisms for preserving public order she said citizens are concerned about march and the government is preparing not only for march but for a year that is full of important milestones rubilar added cristian pertuze a member of the governing council of the national institute of human rights said the public agency that defends citizens has been running special training and bringing in extra lawyers as well as gear of its own we are acquiring new equipment such as safety helmets and gas masks for our team that will be on the ground he said chile a country of about 18 million has been one of the region s fastest growing for years yet many chileans are deeply indebted and the level of income inequality is one of the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development a club of 36 mostly rich countries household debt is rising and the savings rate is falling while unemployment and pension payments are at the low end of the scale among the world s wealthy nations if the government wants to avoid scenarios similar to those of last year it will have to start changing the whole model said diaz the law student the protests have depressed consumer and business confidence stifled investment and sparked a selloff in local assets such as the chilean peso the currency has weakened about 10 the worst performance of any in the emerging markets the central bank and the government lowered growth estimates for the year cesar guajardo 36 said the real estate development company he heads morell cia will have employees work remotely next month our operations have been severely affected he said all of this has led to a lot of uncertainty for the investment groups that we sell our projects to all of the projects have been delayed or even canceled some of our clients have even started to develop projects in other countries such as peru guajardo said continued unrest and delays could force him to fire workers some economists are more concerned by the protests than by the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the price of copper chile s main export local factors will have much more weight than what comes from abroad gonzalo sanhueza an economist at asset manager econsult said in an interview with pauta bloomberg radio investors are moving to reduce exposure to the peso taking money out of local fixed income funds to buy assets denominated in dollars according to jaime achondo head of trading at fynsa a brokerage and asset management firm the april vote offers an uncertain escape route support for a new constitution actually has fallen from 78 on november 11 to 67 on february 7 according to pollster cadem the percentage of people in favor of continuing the protests fell to 56 in a separate cadem poll published february 17 from 72 in october the solution is to continue strengthening the institutional road to end the crisis and for that the plebiscite will be key said de la fuente of fundacion chile 21 the plebiscite will be the key to leave the crisis behind guajardo said that even if the measure is approved that may not be enough it will be two more years of uncertainty during the drafting of the new constitution especially regarding property rights he said and if rejection wins then those who are protesting will surely protest even more to contact the reporters on this story valentina fuentes in santiago at vfuentes8 bloomberg net eduardo thomson in santiago at

financial policymakers from the world s 20 largest economies expect a modest uptick in the global economy this year and next but say growth remains vulnerable to geopolitical risks trade tensions and policy uncertainties the group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors also see the need for an enhanced global risk monitoring on the back of the recent outbreak of the deadly coronavirus the recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions the g20 said in a joint communique in riyadh on sunday however global economic growth remains slow and downside risks to the outlook persist a rise in geopolitical tensions the threat of a disorderly brexit and trade tensions between the us and china last year pulled the global economic growth to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis the phase one trade deal between the world s two biggest economies has cut the overhang to some extent the financial leaders also reaffirmed the conclusions on trade and investment that were finalised at the osaka summit in 2019 the group said it would continue to take joint action to strengthen international cooperation and frameworks we will continue to monitor and as necessary continue to tackle financial vulnerabilities we also reaffirm our commitment to ensure a stronger global financial safety net reaffirm our exchange rate commitments made in march 2018 according to the communique the spread of the deadly covid 19 is another risk that could hamper global growth the epidemic has so far infected more than 76 000 people in china and claimed 2 442 lives in the country the infection is also rapidly spreading in countries such as south korea italy and iran china s economy which grew at the slowest pace in three decades last year on the back of the tariff war is expected to slow further this year the international monetary fund on saturday lowered china s economic growth forecast by 0 4 percentage points to 5 6 per cent and said the epidemic could shave 0 1 percentage points from global growth the washington based fund which expects a v shaped impact on the chinese economy is leading calls for a synchronised policy response to soften the impact of the epidemic on global growth we must work together to contain covid 19 both its human and economic impact especially if the outbreak turns out to be more persistent and widespread the imf managing director kristalina georgieva said in a statement on sunday the imf stands ready to help including through our catastrophe and containment relief trust that can provide grants for debt relief to the poorest most vulnerable countries china was represented at the riyadh g20 meeting by its ambassador to the kingdom as senior economic and finance officials continue to grapple with the spread of the virus saudi arabia s central bank governor ahmed al kholifey however on saturday told an iif conference in riyadh it is too early to judge the impact of the virus on global gdp specifically on coronavirus members are deeply saddened by the loss of life and suffering the g20 remains in close coordination with all relevant stakeholder to stand ready to take further action to address these risks saudi finance minister mohammed al jadaan said at the conclusion of the meeting finance ministers and central bankers are facing the challenge of low interest rates globally continued expansionary monetary policy stance has left central banks limited policy headroom to manoeuver in a more serious economic slowdown elevated financial asset prices and their impact of financial stability have challenged the policy makers globally monetary policy should continue to support economic activity and ensure price stability consistent with central banks mandates the communique noted the financial leaders who also discussed the challenges arising from digitisation of economies endorsed a global tax overhaul proposed last year by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the proposed regulations affect global technology giants from alphabet s google to facebook and amazon to china s alibaba group taxing tech companies globally most of whom are us firms is opposed by washington the proposal to tax the companies in the country of their operation is aimed at increasing tax revenue the oecd calls the tax pillar one while the minimum effective tax rate is called the pillar two european countries in particular are enthusiastic about taxing multinational technology firms however the us has warned it will take retaliatory measures against the move we welcome the recent progress made on addressing the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy the g20 said in the communique we endorse the outline of the architecture of a unified approach on pillar one as the basis for negotiations and welcome the progress note on pillar two it said we encourage further progress on both pillars to overcome remaining differences and reaffirm our commitment to reach a consensus based solution with a final report to be delivered by the end of 2020 the leaders said the global landscape is being rapidly transformed by economic social environmental technological and demographic changes the collective work of the group of 20 largest economies should focus on fostering sustainable development and growth and create the conditions in which all people can live work and thrive therefore we agree to develop a menu of policy options that countries can draw from to enhance access to opportunities for all the leaders said in the communique infrastructure a key driver of growth can be further enhanced through technology the g20 said adding that it agreed to develop an infrastructure technology infratech agenda we will also continue to advance the implementation of the roadmap to infrastructure as an asset class including a focus on the regulatory framework for private sector participation in infrastructure investment according to the communique when asked about the ongoing political and financial turmoil in lebanon and if help will be extended by the g20 or on bilateral level mr al jadaan said that lebanon is an arab country and we surely care and always follow up on what s happening there the kingdom is in touch with other countries but we need to follow up before presenting any reforms on political level and should see with other countries would like to collaborate as well he added
misheck mutize via the conversation there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms
global investors are being overly complacent about downside economic risks aggravated by but not limited to the growing impact of coronavirus they are underestimating the forces that are changing the very nature of the world economy a growing degree of deglobalization in the face of u s chinese decoupling at the same time they are overestimating the power of monetary and fiscal stimulus to keep the global economic party going when g 20 finance ministers meet this weekend in riyadh they ll do so at a time when all of the world s ten major economies are slowing and several confront recession next week beijing is likely to announce a delay in the meeting of its national people s congress due to the coronavirus outbreak this week apple raised fears of more global corporate troubles to come with a virus caused revenue warning the full ripple effects of the virus and of the economic impact of humans scared to be with other humans will show up in first quarter results in particular in tourism travel and on all chinese and global companies that depend on chinese supply chains and markets despite all that investor complacency persists in no small part due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how rapidly the world has changed economically and politically we are only in the opening pages of this new era of major power competition and technological change and there s no model to price in its impact get the inflection points newsletter subscribe to frederick kempe s weekly inflection points column which focuses on the global challenges facing the united states and how to best address them name first last email email this field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged within democracies the public s faith has been shaken in capitalism and globalization to produce results that deliver greater prosperity most recently that has driven everything from the recent irish election victory of sinn fein to the uk s departure from the european union to the erosion of the german political center most dramatic is the growing possibility that u s presidential elections this year could produce a showdown between two populists of different stripes but similar decibels donald trump and bernie sanders both are septuagenarian insurgents who appeal to hard core unconventional constituencies and that s prompted global concern that the new u s normal may be abnormal all of that is unfolding against a backdrop of a major power test that at its heart is a systemic struggle between democratic and authoritarian capitalist models though traditional security analysts continue to worry about how u s chinese u s russian or u s iranian tensions could unravel into armed conflict the more likely outcome is a resource sapping continual competition that stops short of kinetics but involves information warfare cyber assaults and economic clashes ranging from trade wars to targeted sanctions but let s get back to investors and their complacency which is as easy to explain as it is increasingly hard to justify every time the global economy approached the brink in the decade since the great financial crisis of 2008 2009 some intervening force pulled us back the latest came last year when it looked as though the global economy might slow to below 2 percent gdp growth generally considered a way to measure the onset of a global recession central banks stepped up as the international monetary fund has pointed out 49 central banks cut interest rates 71 times last year the result was a 0 5 percent global gdp boost according to the imf monetary policy saved the day investors understand that coronavirus could be a major 2020 shock but they are wagering again that something will prevent this from being an economic disaster they realize the u s fed and other central banks may have fewer monetary tools to deploy so they are counting on increased fiscal stimulus from governments for example chinese lenders on thursday cut their one year loan prime rate which is used across the financial system by 0 1 percentage point to 4 05 percent the result was a rallying of chinese stocks that day of 2 2 percent of the benchmark csi 300 index that followed the chinese central bank s cut to its medium term lending rate this week as well as dozens of other measures beijing has introduced in recent days to support businesses hit by the epidemic the financial times reports that china s central bank thus far has made 300 billion rmb available to large lenders and local banks in hard hit areas particularly hubei province even so the s p global ratings forecast that china s 2020 growth could fall to 4 4 percent from its 6 percent level last year if the coronavirus hit continues through april most predictions of that sort probably err on the optimistic side and it may be wishful thinking that china s economy will make up most of what is being lost once coronavirus recedes at the same time the eurozone economy barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2019 up only 0 1 percent from the previous quarter the slowest rate since 2013 germany had zero growth real gdp in the eurozone was up just 0 9 percent in 2019 the slowest rate since 2013 with the uk now leaving the eu its leaders failed to agree on their budget on friday due to insoluble differences governments across the world see these storm clouds and a bloomberg survey of economic forecasts shows that budgets are loosening in more than half of the world s 20 biggest economies providing some of the fiscal stimulus that central bankers have been seeking from their government counterparts markets are wagering that the combination of fiscal and monetary measures will again prevent the worst however what if they re wrong other than the united states major central banks are tapped out some of them experimenting with negative interest rates some experts argue that our low interest rate environment allows greater borrowing for fiscal stimulus

in this perverted life good behaviour is generally viewed as uninspiringly drab while bad habits are considered to be titillatingly infectious contagious addictive and fashionable this is why societies valorise bad boys and deify slay queens it is no different in zimbabwe where those all too known crooks who are famous for staining night life in most of our cities around the country through ostentatiously displaying ill gotten riches are euphemistically called socialites well socialites my foot they should be called exactly what they are shameless criminals some people are drawn to this abomination probably because human beings as claimed by thomas hobbes a 16th century british thinker are innately inclined to chaos you should forgive bishop lazi for sometimes disproportionately quoting this philosopher because as a man of the cloth he has intensely and intently studied his works for some of its controversial views on religion you see hobbes thought process and world view was a product of experiences borne out of a traumatising series of social political and economic upheavals in particular the british civil wars of 1642 46 and 1648 51 left an indelible impression on the englishman who had to temporarily flee to france to escape the rigmarole of bloody revolution he unsurprisingly concluded that the natural condition of mankind is a state of violence insecurity and constant threat when interpreted differently it means when human beings are left to their own designs they generally gravitate towards disorder and evil garden debacle and then there is the biblical creation story of adam and eve in genesis well it is a story of what could possibly happen to human beings even when put in the most pristine and utopian of environments we are told that after their creation adam and eve were given a bountiful garden eden which was replete with all imaginable comforts however there was one caveat god forbade them from eating the fruit that was at the centre of the garden but the devil reportedly came in the form of a serpent and talked the couple into breaking the only rule only one rule they been given by their creator it makes you think if human beings can disregard a simple commandment from a supreme being that can give and take life how can they possibly abide by rules and laws created by man some theologians however argue that the story of adam and eve is a creation myth contrived by both christians and jews for bishop lazi the lesson that mankind just like adam and eve are inherently attracted to bad habits came in the form of his nephew in school the lad was hopelessly dull and beyond salvation and he conceded as much he pursued music instead and wanted to be a big time artiste in his case the devil did not come as a serpent but as seemingly well intentioned peers who advised him his career could soar to the stratosphere if he could unlock doors to the creative world this he was told could only be done if he smoked mbanje cannabis which they said had the potential to sweat his creative juices instead of opening the door to creativity he gradually opened the door to the psychotic world of lunacy trying to wean him from the hallucinogenic drug was incredibly difficult it actually took tonnes of medicine heavy doses of prayer and nth man hours of counselling this is when the bishop realised that addiction is a monster that takes persistence and determination to slay addicts presently in zimbabwe we are all addicts after more than a decade of sustained and coordinated attacks through sanctions imposed by the united states and the european union the zimbabwe dollar caved in by alarmingly losing its value which prompted the switch to the multi currency system in february 2009 what many do not realise is that for the zimdollar obviously the troublesome provision was and still is s 2779 of the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery amendment act zdera of 2018 which amended the zdera of 2001 and restricts the united states from voting in support of new assistance to zimbabwe from international financial institutions it is not a secret that the world bank group and the international monetary fund which practically underwrite the global financial system are controlled by uncle sam since zimbabwe was cut off from international finance it progressively depleted its foreign reserves which are ordinarily used to defend the value of its currency where countries are facing foreign currency shortages and cannot access affordable finance to meet their international payment obligations they get balance of payment support from the imf but this has not been the case for our teapot shaped republic but something happened after the policy shift in 2009 we began bingeing on the us dollar actually we became hooked on it like an addictive drug we used it to buy kapenta vegetables mopani worms and other odds and ends unfortunately what bishop lazi and most people like him did not know was that as non exporters the us dollars that he was effortlessly drawing from banks and crapulously feeding on were being generated by exporters and it was not surprising when the banks and atms finally ran dry causing massive cash shortages so like mbanje the us dollar was hallucinogenic to us it made us think that everything was alright but our challenges actually remained not only did the cash crisis show the underlying economic problems plaguing the economy which had decidedly become a retail economy but it also showed the folly of operating without a monetary policy furore well the lessons we learnt from the multi currency era were quite clear the economy could not generate enough foreign currency to meet local demand which meant cash shortages selling rather than manufacturing became lucrative which meant de industrialisation and dwindling job prospects for locals and relatedly local products could not compete on the international market the reason to introduce the zimdollar to de dollarise was taken with a long term view to reverse the above trend the bishop was quite amused by the debate last week most of it hare brained of course of whether the economy was re dollarising or de dollarising while government thinks we are de dollarising there is a phalanx of furious analysts who believe that this is not the case my take both are correct kikikiki experientially it might seem we are re dollarising but technically we are de dollarising numbers do not lie last year 189 million transactions worth 459 billion were processed through our systems which is not surprising the bulk of our goods especially basic commodities are predominantly purchased in local currency bills are similarly being settled this way the fact that there is now a population explosion of forex dealers connotes that increasingly more people are changing the forex into the local currency in order to meet their day to day convenience show me a consumer who is buying his her bread or vegetables in forex a commuter who is using hard currency to travel and i would gladly concede that the economy is indeed re dollarising in any case the volume value and velocity of us dollar transactions are markedly lower than electronic transactions that some do not have confidence in it is another question altogether what might seem to be policy inconsistency where government tries to harness free funds to lessen the burden on the fiscus is actually an exercise in pragmatism remember there is more than us 1 2 billion in international remittances us 635 million from diaspora remittances and us 521 million from non governmental organisations that is floating around in the economy there is no textbook formula for peculiar economic circumstances such as those which zimbabwe found itself in deng xiaoping the father of china s modern miracle once said you cross the river by feeling the stones which essentially emphasises the importance of pragmatism all these nuances need to be considered as more cash is imported and injected into the system its use is bound to further increase it is a process in fact a five year process not an event headwinds against the local currency will continue as government faces a plethora of competing needs most of which need foreign currency to be met thank god for the rains they are going to provide the much needed lift in the medium term hallelujah however if government continues to be disciplined which is the current anchor of the local currency with time all things will fall into place but in a polarised politically toxic environment facts and reason become a convenient casualty of runaway prejudice and biases not for bishop lazi i would rather be a dog and bark at the moon than be such a zimbabwean bishop out

the inability of the transmission company of nigeria the generation companies as well as the distribution companies to deliver stable power supply and provide satisfactory customer services to electricity consumers in the country is as a result of inappropriate pricing of electricity writes obinna chima since november 2013 when the power holding company of nigeria phcn successor companies were handed over to their new owners the perennial challenge of epileptic power supply which over the years contributed to the frail economic growth recorded by the country has remained unabated in fact the expectation of improved and stable supply of electricity with the government then setting a target of 10 000 megawatts after the exercise has remained a mirage as owners of the privatised power companies have not been able to realise the objectives for which they acquired the assets however rather than taking steps to improve the situation the power sector investors have been enmeshed in more squabbles than envisaged the defunct phcn was then broken into 11 distribution companies and nine generation companies as well as one transmission company nigeria s dilapidated power sector is often criticised by analysts for holding back the country s economic potential businesses and households are subject to frequent blackouts and many depend on their own generators that are expensive to run analysts have said the challenges in the sector are multi faceted and require a holistic approach to address so as to instill confidence among consumers as well as attract the desired investors owing to these challenges in the sector especially in the area of illiquidity the federal government since the handover has been forced to intervene to keep the successor companies afloat and prevent a total collapse of the sector to address the situation analysts have stressed the need for the introduction of a cost reflective tariff regime sector review to the minister of power engr sale mamman the n1 684 trillion outstanding receivable owed the power generation companies gencos is a key challenge in the sector according to him this has been a major source of concern to the federal government mamman also pointed out that the access of the distribution companies discos to borrowing instruments had been limited by the fact that they were already over leveraged however as part of efforts to ensure market efficiency and transparency the minister explained that the federal government had undertaken the improvement of commercial technical and regulatory components of transaction agreements promotion of fiscal discipline through the effective utilisation of all power sector loans promotion of market disciple and achievement of cost reflective tariff that would facilitate mutual benefits to both investors and consumers mamman disclosed these in a presentation to the national economic council nec recently the current rate of power electrification revealed by the minister in the report placed lagos as the state with the highest level of electrification in the country at 95 per cent closely followed by anambra about 92 per cent and imo 90 per cent but states such as adamawa bauchi benue borno ebonyi jigawa taraba yobe and zamfara ranked low with about 30 per cent electrification rate mamman listed other challenges in the sector to include gas constraints for thermal generation idle generation capacity and the historically perennial under investment in the development and expansion of the grid he observed the lack of adequate investment in the distribution network pointing out that nigeria remained among the lowest per capita electricity supply in africa with a high rate of rural to urban migration he identified some present and emerging challenges in the sector to include misalignment between generation transmission and distribution as well as the rising cost of undelivered electricity capacity others he stated included declining discos remittance coordination and corporate governance challenge as well as challenges faced by the discos the gencos and the transmission company the report put the average tested capacity for hydro in the country at 1 225mw and thermal at 6 241 65mw on the other hand on grid generation capacity for hydro was said to be 1 936mw thermal 11 154mw average actual transmission wheeled 4 117 5 average unutilised transmission capacity 2 883 average total operational capacity for hydro 1258 18 and thermal 4 201 97 the minister listed measures that were being adopted to address the challenges to include infrastructural alignment market efficiency and transparency corporate governance enhancement and sector policy coordination increasing energy access and the execution of legacy projects in the sector in the area of infrastructure alignment he listed measures introduced by the federal government to involve the commencement of the implementation of phase one of the nigerian electricity roadmap continuous implementation of the transmission rehabilitation and expansion programme trep supporting the full implementation of the disco franchise as well as the promotion of grid standardisation and synchronisation the minister stated that as part of efforts to ensure market efficiency and transparency the federal government had undertaken the refinement of commercial technical and regulatory components of transaction agreements this he added included promotion of fiscal discipline through the effective utilisation of all power sector loans promotion of market discipline and ensuring the achievement of cost reflective tariff that would facilitate mutual benefit to investors and consumers in terms of energy access he said the government had taken steps to scale up its energy access models develop additional energy access models as well as promotion of investment into off grid projects cost reflective tariff as way out in order to address the challenges in the sector the managing director and chief executive officer of the transmission company of nigeria tcn mr usman mohammed has called on nigerians to be prepared for the payment of cost reflective tariffs on electricity mohammed identified the payment of cost reflective electricity tariffs as the answer to the problem of power supply in nigeria he said we will not move forward if we cannot pay the right tariffs for consumption of electricity i want to assure nigerians that there is no relationship between poverty and payment of electricity so let us stop deceiving ourselves that we can refuse to pay for electricity and still enjoy constant power supply that is why i said that nigerians should prepare to pay cost reflective tariffs so that these contracts can be effective also service will significantly improve once tariffs become effective we have to be prepared to remove government from the middle this issue of government guarantees subsidy has not worked and will not work look at a place like burkina faso that is sitting on one of the poorest part of west africa is having a collection efficiency of 98 per cent if that country will get electricity from ivory coast and pay for it i cannot see any reason someone will say that nigerians cannot pay i want to tell you that nigeria has the cheapest tariff in west africa he added if we are not careful we will continue to sink money in the power sector and still remain on 4000mw power generation in the next three years he noted that nigerians must be prepared to pay for electricity in order to improve power supply mohammed said no private investor would invest in the power sector without the assurance of favourable returns nigeria has done the power sector reform and handed over the distribution sector to the private sector six years ago within these years the federal government has sunk n1 5 trillion in the power sector because contracts were not effective and the revenue flow is not there so the government was guaranteeing the generation companies to continue to do business but do we want it to continue no so how do we stop it we can only stop it when contracts become effective by assuring cost reflective tariffs what the poor need is effective metering of electricity to enable them manage their consumption he said also the bureau of public enterprises bpe recently reiterated that a cost reflective tariff structure must be developed and implemented to change the narrative in the electricity sector and make the sector financially viable bpe said the electricity market had been haemorrhaging badly needed money due to lack of cost reflective tariff it also said heavy debts by ministries departments and agencies mdas of government were also hampering the growth of the power sector those assertions were contained in a recent report titled nigerian electricity supply industry nesi reform processes challenges and the way forward which the bpe presented to the national economic council nec ad hoc committee on the power sector a copy of which was obtained recently the bpe pointed out in the report that the federal government s inability to follow through its commitments had affected the performance agreements pas frowning on the refusal of parties to adhere to commitments made before the handover the bureau recommended the creation of a robust institutional framework that would be ad hoc in nature made up of critical actors and chaired by the vice president as a first step towards resolution of the power crisis in the report bpe said its analysis had revealed that the power sector would require funding to the tune of 7 6 billion over a five year period stressing that there is a correlation between energy consumption and gross domestic product gdp per capita it listed other major challenges facing the sector to include withdrawal of the transitional subsidy support and dumping of the central bank of nigeria cbn backed nigeria electricity market stabilisation facility nemsf on the balance sheet of the discos bpe also cited the major shift in nigeria s macroeconomic indicators exchange rate inflation and lack of stable regulatory environment as factors hurting the electricity sector it expressed dismay at the grave shortfall in power generation in the country which averaged about 3 500 mw in the past 10 years and the liquidity crisis in the sector the agency lamented that discos collected only about 30 per cent of market requirements bpe said regulatory inconsistency over the years had weighed down the sector according to the agency there is transmission system constraints where the network can only wheel about 5 000 mw in reality an independent analysis by siemens indicated that the existing last mile distribution capacity in the operation is about twice as high as the peak supply delivered by tcn to the respective distribution there is also lack of proper coordination of the public sector agencies involved in the power sector and the refusal of parties to adhere strictly to commitments made before handover the bureau said there was an urgent need for implementation of the power sector recovery plan it said the challenges to the power sector are as old as nigeria to solve them the political leadership must be committed have sincerity of purpose and the will to take hard decisions the nigeria goal is to provide universal access to power for nigerians by 2030 to achieve that we must have a roadmap and a policy that will attract private sector investment human capital and an institutional framework to reach set goals the first step in resolving the power logjam is the need to create a robust institutional framework that is ad hoc in nature and made up of critical actors the committee is to be chaired by the vice president and made up of heads of relevant ministries and agencies bpe explained that the role of the committee would be to monitor and coordinate the deliverables in the power sector adding that it would also eliminate obstacles and bottlenecks in the attainment of agreed targets the first assignment of the committee bpe said would be to ensure the power sector recovery plan approved by the federal executive council fec was diligently and vigorously implemented the power sector plan clearly defined policy actions operational and financial interventions meant to restore the financial viability of the power sector bedevilled by liquidity crisis it stated explaining the issues raised are germane to the socio economic development of this country without resolving the power crisis nigeria will remain underdeveloped with no major educational industrial or agricultural development the bureau said all hands must be on deck working in the same direction to implement the power sector recovery plan approved by the fec nigeria can solve the power deficit challenges under the current leadership for that to happen political leadership at the highest level must make the required bold and ambitious moves after all new delhi from where we adapted our distribution companies privatisation model went through same pains we are going through today to analysts at fsdh merchant bank limited adjusting the price of electricity is a key reform the federal government must undertake to engender growth in the country according to the firm more investments would be required in the power sector than currently available but the sector may not attract investment in the absence of a cost reflective tariff they argued in the same vein the partner west africa energy leader pwc mr pedro omontuemhen who stressed the need for a cost reflective tariff in the sector however noted that it would not solve the problems of the sector given the many challenges facing it omontuemhen had told thisday that the challenges of the power sector in nigeria are many but one of the challenges is financing technology is a challenge recovery of debts is a challenge infrastructure is a challenge but sometimes you do need money to solve some of these challenges that we have if you don t have enough money you will not be able to invest in the required infrastructure so the issue now is that if you price this product appropriately and it is well managed the management of the distribution companies will now have money to invest in the right infrastructure so our view is that it is a step taken in the right direction but the challenge now is for the distribution companies to ensure that power is now available for the director research and advocacy association of nigerian electricity distributors aned mr sunday oduntan appropriate pricing through cost reflective tariff will go a long way in solving the sector s problems he said when you are talking about efficiency efficiency is also linked to pricing you cannot be efficient in any business even in bakery if there is no appropriate pricing oduntan said inappropriate pricing was responsible for the lack of efficiency of the operators he said i think we need to be more sensitive to the need of our customers i think we are not there yet but the discos that i represent and everybody all stakeholders in the value chain are not efficient enough efficiency is very important as i have spoken about the link between efficiency and pricing so i agree 100 per cent that there is the need for more consumer confidence consumer education and like now people have been talking about tariff increase on january 1 all those ones we need to do more in terms of letting people be aware of what is going on the piecemeal or gradual increment makes people to think that they increase tariff all the time he commended nerc for its efforts in making in the last six month to stabilise the power sector the last time a review was done in this sector was in 2015 and it took effect on february 1 2016 what the law said is that there should be minor review every six months which is why i have commended nerc for coming out for the first time since 2016 to do what we should have done every six months from that first quarter of 2016 what they are proposing is slight increase that will occur in april 2020 and it is even planned to be a gradual thing we will not have what should be the appropriate pricing of the product this year what is planned is to see that by the end of 2021 there will be a way to ensure that appropriate things are done such that there will not be that huge shortfall he stated oduntan in a separate statement yesterday also said the application of the new tariffs by the discos would be gradual and less painful to electricity consumers he added that it would take until 2021 before the differences in the reviewed tariff could be fully passed to consumers oduntan explained that they wanted to clarify to nigerians how the new tariff framework would be implemented with the aim of clearing the misunderstanding that its announcement had created we make this statement to inform all our esteemed customers that we are not unmindful of news making the rounds that electricity tariffs have been increased effective january 1 2020 as reported in some print and electronic media for clarity and improved understanding we state the nigerian electricity supply industry nesi is primarily regulated by the nigeria electricity regulatory commission nerc nerc is empowered by the epsr act electric power sector reform to make orders and declarations in a manner promoting efficiency and sustainability within the nesi said the aned according to the association the nerc has been empowered by epsra to carry out minor reviews of power tariffs under the multi year tariff order myto 2015 framework twice a year it explained that accurate electricity tariffs help in ensuring efficient power supply as well as assure market participants of their costs recovery and return on investment this makes the business viable nerc has just reviewed the myto 2015 and has published an order on tariffs and minimum remittance for january june 2020 the tariffs anticipate changes in the currency exchange rates between the united states and nigeria changes in the rate of inflation and gas prices oduntan added according to him nigerians have to start facing the reality that if you really want something good you must be prepared to pay for what is good we as nigerians cannot expect electricity like in south africa in the united kingdom while at the same time we don t want to be paying even over there in senegal they pay in ghana they pay more and the bread analogy works because what i am telling you is that if the woman is taking bread at n80 per loaf and such a woman is forced by law to sell the same at n30 for instance there is a shortfall of n50 you cannot get the bread after a while because first there will not be efficiency with time there will not be availability so the issue of electricity is availability and efficiency he argued in a recent interview on arisetv a thisday sister broadcast station similarly csl stockbrokers limited in a recent report stressed that the present low tariff regime retards development of the power sector clearly a situation whereby the mdas would continue to owe the power companies humongous amount of money continues to impact negatively on the performance of operators in addition nigerians must be willing to embrace the impending reforms in the sector which is expected to lead to an improvement in power supply and generally enhance output in the country
when g 20 finance ministers meet this weekend in riyadh they ll do so at a time when all of the world s ten major economies are slowing and several confront recession investor complacency persists in no small part due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how rapidly the world has changed economically and politically we are only in the opening pages of this new era of major power competition and technological change and there s no model to price in its impact thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe global investors are being overly complacent about downside economic risks aggravated but not limited to the growing impact of coronavirus they are underestimating the forces that are changing the very nature of the world economy a growing degree of deglobalization in the face of u s chinese decoupling at the same time they are overestimating the power of monetary and fiscal stimulus to keep the global economic party going when g 20 finance ministers meet this weekend in riyadh they ll do so at a time when all of the world s ten major economies are slowing and several confront recession next week beijing is likely to announce a delay in the meeting of its national people s congress due to the coronavirus outbreak this week apple raised fears of more global corporate troubles to come with a coronavirus caused revenue warning the full ripple effects of the virus and of the economic impact of humans scared to be with other humans will show up in first quarter results in particular in tourism travel and on all chinese and global companies that depend on chinese supply chains and markets despite all that investor complacency persists in no small part due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how rapidly the world has changed economically and politically we are only in the opening pages of this new era of major power competition and technological change and there s no model to price in its impact within democracies the public s faith has been shaken in capitalism and globalization to produce results that deliver greater prosperity most recently that has driven everything from the recent irish election victory of sinn fein to the uk s departure from the european union to the erosion of the german political center markets are wagering that the combination of fiscal and monetary measures will again prevent the worst however what if they re wrong most dramatic is the growing possibility that u s presidential elections this year could produce a showdown between two populists of different stripes but similar decibels donald trump and bernie sanders both are septuagenarian insurgents who appeal to hard core unconventional constituencies and that s prompted global concern that the new u s normal may be abnormal all of that is unfolding against a backdrop of a major power test that at its heart is a systemic struggle between democratic and authoritarian capitalist models though traditional security analysts continue to worry about how u s chinese u s russian or u s iranian tensions could unravel into armed conflict the more likely outcome is a resource sapping continual competition that stops short of kinetics but involves information warfare cyber assaults and economic clashes ranging from trade wars to targeted sanctions but let s get back to investors and their complacency which is as easy to explain as it is increasingly hard to justify every time the global economy approached the brink in the decade since the great financial crisis of 2008 2009 some intervening force pulled us back the latest came last year when it looked as though the global economy might slow to below 2 percent gdp growth generally considered a way to measure the onset of a global recession central banks stepped up as the international monetary fund has pointed out 49 central banks cut interest rates 71 times last year the result was a 0 5 percent global gdp boost according to the imf monetary policy saved the day investors understand that coronavirus could be a major 2020 shock but they are wagering again that something will prevent this from becoming an economic disaster they realize the u s fed and other central banks may have fewer monetary tools to deploy so they are counting on increased fiscal stimulus from governments for example chinese lenders on thursday cut their one year loan prime rate which is used across the financial system by 0 1 percent to 4 05 percent the result was a rallying of chinese stocks that day of 2 2 percent of the benchmark csi 300 index that followed the chinese central bank s cut to its medium term lending rate this week as well as dozens of other measures beijing has introduced in recent days to support businesses hit by the epidemic the financial times reports that china s central bank thus far has made 300 billion rmb available to large lenders and local banks in hard hit areas particularly hubei province wishful thinking even so the s p global ratings forecast that china s 2020 growth could fall to 4 4 percent from its 6 percent level last year if the coronavirus hit continues through april most predictions of that sort probably err on the optimistic side and it may be wishful thinking that china s economy will make up most of what is being lost once coronavirus recedes at the same time the eurozone economy barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2019 up only 0 1 percent from the previous quarter the slowest rate since 2013 germany had zero growth real gdp in the eurozone was up just 0 9 percent in 2019 the slowest rate since 2013 with the uk now leaving the eu its leaders failed to agree on their budget on friday due to insoluble differences governments across the world see these storm clouds and a bloomberg survey of economic forecasts shows that budgets are loosening in more than half of the world s 20 biggest economies providing some of the fiscal stimulus that central bankers have been seeking from their government counterparts markets are wagering that the combination of fiscal and monetary measures will again prevent the worst however what if they re wrong other than the united states major central banks are tapped out some of them experimenting with negative interest rates some experts argue that our low interest rate environment allows greater borrowing for fiscal stimulus that s risky business near the

photo shammi mehra afp via getty images this is the first of two pieces looking at the state of the indian economy in 2020 this week president donald trump makes an official visit to india the world s most populous democracy this visit is hugely symbolic as both countries attempt to grapple with the rise of china which they see as a challenge to an international order based on the rule of law as well as to their traditional spheres of influence the indian economy is now estimated to be the world s third largest after china and the us in purchasing power parity terms but the regrettable reality is that it is in no way comparable with the american juggernaut the fading star it seems like only yesterday that india was the wonder child of the world economy as recently as 2014 it was lauded as the fastest growing g 20 economy beating china among others with economic growth in the 7 8 range according to the paris based oecd many foresaw india challenging china as an asian economic superpower even then however some astute analysts like harvard s arvind subramanian argued that india s official data may well overstate actual growth rates over the past couple of years india s growth rate has slipped back to around 5 and is now below china s once again and while the oecd argues that india s growth is projected to recover after a temporary slowdown many analysts don t share this optimism reigniting weak corporate investment will not be that easy it is true that since 2014 the indian government has implemented some impressive measures and that there have been some positive developments but even on the bright side all is not rosy bumpy implementation of national sales tax in 2017 the government implemented a nation wide goods and services tax gst to replace myriad state level indirect taxes this is important because india has not had a single market economy due to the barriers imposed by different state level taxes but the implementation of the new gst has been problematic compliance is complex especially for small business implementation is proving difficult revenues have been weak and there are many reports of fraud over the longer term the new gst could improve the business environment but the government needs to iron out these problems last year the government also cut india s high corporate tax rates a welcome move for stimulating investment but the government also faces a difficult juggling act with its already high public debt in a nation where very few people even pay tax in 2017 18 less than 4 of the population filed a tax return in a country with the world record for non performing loans the new insolvency and bankruptcy code implemented in 2016 could result in faster recognition and resolution of bankruptcies this is important because banks should be lending to new and promising firms and industries not failing ones but this initiative is bogged down by insufficient judges foreign investment and infrastructure improving one very positive story is india s strong inward foreign direct investment driven in part by policy liberalization india may well still be behind china singapore and hong kong and some leading western economies but in recent years it has been a major recipient of fdi in 2019 it was the world s eighth largest destination for fdi capturing 49 billion a 16 increase over the previous year but the majority went into services industries including information technology rather than the manufacturing sector which is prime minister narendra modi s priority another good news story is india s improving infrastructure as the building of railways highways rural roads and electricity generation capacities gathers steam and ports are modernized as a frequent visitor to india over many years i have witnessed this firsthand but india is competing with china southeast asia and others in the global marketplace and its infrastructure is lagging these destinations from my discussions with businesspeople it is clear that better infrastructure would further boost fdi the indian government must redouble its efforts to invest in its country invest in its people and offer opportunities to all of its citizens especially women and youth the government is also employing great efforts to promote digitalization in both the private and public sectors beyond the obvious efficiency dividend this can reduce the scope for corruption and support the formalization of the economy not creating enough jobs india s economic travails come at a time when it needs to create jobs for the 11 million young people entering the labor market every year they could offer india a demographic dividend something that most east asian economies enjoyed during their high growth periods but today s reality is that the indian economy is not creating enough jobs and a declining share of the working age population is actually working less than half of india s working age population has a job while in china some 65 are working the unemployment situation is dire for young boys and much worse for young girls with male youth unemployment at close to 20 in india s cities the country is not only wasting its talent but creating the risk of a social crisis to generate enough jobs for its youth india needs to reignite private investment but while world bank studies point to india becoming a less difficult country in which to do business enforcing contracts remains very difficult and land acquisition is complicated and while too many indians struggle to find work more than 80 of those employed work in the informal sector meaning that they have no contract and they are not covered by labor laws or social security strict and complex labor regulations are an impediment to the creation of more formal employment india s neighbors of bangladesh pakistan and sri lanka outperform india in the creation of formal employment india s quality of life is lower than bangladesh s despite decades of solid growth india s record in poverty reduction has been modest based on a poverty line of 1 90 a day poverty fell from 46 of the population in 1993 to 21 in 2011 but if you consider living on less than 5 50 a day to be living in poverty over the same period the share of the population in poverty only fell from 95 to 87 whichever way you look at it most indians are living in or near poverty astonishingly bangladesh a country with a lower gdp per capita has slightly lower poverty than india the problem is that inequality is endemic in india the richest 1 of indians hold more than half of the country s wealth india s social drama goes beyond mere poverty out of the 10 cities most affected by air pollution in the world as measured by the concentration of fine particulates nine are indian and almost 820 000 indians died prematurely in 2017 because of outdoor pollution about 23 more than five years earlier the oecd reports that the welfare cost of premature mortality alone is 7 of gdp annually for outdoor air pollution and 4 2 for indoor air pollution india s potential is immense it is true of course that the government is making efforts to better serve its citizens such as by constructing toilets increasing electricity coverage bringing piped drinking water to more homes building more rural roads and tackling the housing shortage but public resources allocated to health and education are appallingly low and a human capital revolution is necessary once again bangladesh beats india by almost four years when it comes to life expectancy with indians living on average a mere 69 years india has already come a long way since its reform period began in the early 1990s and indians have proved time and again how talented they are when given a chance indians who have migrated to the u s and their descendants earn on average almost double the american average indian success stories in the u s include the ceos of microsoft satya nadella google sundar pichai and a string of other companies as the world s biggest democracy india enjoys the goodwill of the west but the indian government must redouble its efforts to invest in its country invest in its people and offer opportunities to all of its citizens especially women and youth
it s not as fanciful a question as it first seems globalisation for decades the engine of economic growth has gone into reverse automation ai and big tech have irrevocably changed the business and investment landscape at the same time rising inequality has resulted in populist politicians from the us to europe either surging to power or having their policies adopted by mainstream politicians the intergenerational divide appears wider than ever worryingly faith in our institutions political economic cultural is dwindling at a time when climate change threatens us all dramatic stuff however as investors our job is to look through short term noise to try and identify long term trends when we do there is much to consider the great divide it s been more than a decade since the global financial crisis gfc but its reverberations continue to this day the global monetary policy response while seen as essential at the time has caused a marked redistribution of wealth away from savers and towards risk takers according to wells fargo us savers lost up to 600 billion in interest payments from their bank accounts due to federal reserve policy meanwhile quantitative easing printing money to buy government debt has as intended by many of its authors pushed cheap capital into risk assets equity markets have been on the march ever since despite the faltering global economy adding fuel to the fire share buybacks are at an all time high according to ned davis research between early 2011 and 2018 us s p 500 companies bought back over 3 5 trillion of their own stock a new source of demand that further added to the handsome returns made by shareholders over the period unfortunately not everybody owns risk assets like equities for those who do not the last 10 years have looked a lot different real wages have stagnated in the west despite historically low unemployment rates since president trump came to power the s p 500 has climbed 40 workers pay has only increased 9 during that period according to the economic policy institute in 2018 the average ceo s pay was 278 times higher than the annual average us workers wage in 1970 the ratio was 30x the root cause lies beyond the gfc for decades the economic and business consensus has insisted that deregulation privatisation and globalisation would bring prosperity to all outsourcing of production and jobs was tolerated if it meant better living standards and cheaper goods back home in reality this outsourcing marginalised huge swathes of the economy affecting industries from manufacturing to mining many workers lost their jobs thanks to automation off shoring and a i president trump s make america great again tapped directly into this sentiment brexit this wealth divide is mirrored in the uk according to a report by the institute for public policy research britain is the fifth most unfair economy in europe one fifth of the country lives below the poverty line despite most households working meanwhile 10 of the population owns 44 of the country s wealth further households in the south east of england have combined wealth of 2 46 trillion compared with 368 billion in the north west given these factors a political reaction was perhaps inevitable in june 2016 52 of britons voted to leave the european union eu the result exposed deep divisions every part of the country except london scotland and northern ireland voted to leave on education a report by yougov indicated that 70 of those with only one gsce or lower voted to exit the eu while 68 with a university degree opted to remain meanwhile 71 of under 25s wanted to stay in the eu compared to 36 of over 65s the common argument was that leave voters felt left behind whether this was due to the years of austerity also part of the post gfc medicine or the eu is now a moot point but cut to four years later and an even more fundamental shift occurred in the uk the iron lady in december 2019 the conservative party won the general election by a landslide during campaigning boris johnson promised to tax and spend and to bring the north of england back into the economic fold austerity died overnight this was a new conservative party most importantly though he promised to get brexit done the results also saw the political map turned on its head labour voters abandoned decades old allegiances and defected to the tories across the uk s industrial heartlands from durham to wrexham the so called red wall crumbed it was labour s worst election result since the 1930s the margaret thatcher parallels are easy to make she too was swept to power with a thumping majority from a disenfranchised british electorate eager for change both are also not for turning many pollsters thought that mr johnson would pivot to a softer brexit once he held the keys to 10 downing street his decision to legally prevent an extension to eu trade talks past the end 2020 deadline put that faint hope to bed further out it s hard to tell whether johnson will stick to his populist agenda it is also worth highlighting that the thatcher revolution was much more gradual than it felt at the time the first actions of keith joseph the newly appointed secretary of state for industry and the intellectual powerhouse behind the thatcher revolution was to offer financial lifelines to british leyland and british rail additionally the decision to allow voters to buy their council houses came in 1980 deregulation of the stock exchange and privatisation came in 1986 it may therefore be some time before we can judge the true economic hue of the johnson government and whether it like its 1979 predecessor will result in such a changed version of capitalism the recent high profile changes in personnel at the treasury certainly suggest some strong policy views at no 10 the upcoming budget will i suspect make the direction of travel a little clearer ok boomer all this partially explains the current situation but what of the future of capitalism let s go back to money the wealth gap between generations has grown markedly since the 60s in the us according to federal reserve data boomers those born between 1946 and 1964 currently own 57 of the wealth this compares to gen x 1965 1980 and millennials 1981 1996 which own 16 and 3 respectively millennials earn 20 less than boomers did at their age in real terms compounding matters is the cost of education according to the aarp public policy institute a four year private college course in 2015 16 averaged 39 529 compared to 14 618 for the oldest boomer the cost of housing has soared over that time this means younger generations tend to buy fewer homes and get married later we are also all living for longer which will require millennials and those that follow to fund lengthier retirements for themselves and their families traditional copper bottomed pensions enjoyed by their grandparents are no longer viable as such the next generations will be expected to work longer and save more hardly the stuff to get you out of bed in the morning it s therefore easy to see why there is friction between the generations this schism is showing up in the us presidential polling numbers millennials overwhelmingly support bernie sanders over donald trump the reason sanders contention that capitalism is not working for the many but for the few he is promising radical policies to redress the balance from higher taxes to medicare for all this message is resonating with millennials in a 2019 poll by yougov 70 of those between the ages of 23 and 38 said they would support a socialist candidate for president over half also had a negative view of capitalism by contrast only 36 of boomers said they d support a socialist nominee if millennials get out the vote a big if we could see a sanders victory in november that would fundamentally change the shape of the us economy even if he doesn t win the direction of travel seems clear another term of trump with his plans for further tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to the social safety net could further embolden the next generation of voters but perhaps trump and sanders aren t as different as they first seem true their policies couldn t be further apart but both in their own way are targeting sectors of society that feel left behind by modern capitalism when capitalism is being attacked by both the left and the right then it surely must be time for a rethink a rapidly changing climate there are other arguably more vital factors at play too take the environment it s fair to say 2019 belonged to the issue of climate change a united states conference of mayors survey conducted in december found that 80 of 18 19 year olds view climate change as a major threat to humanity the 2020 world economic forum global risks report was also an eye opener for the first time all top five risks in terms of likelihood of occurrence were environmental additionally three of the top five in terms of impact were also environmental rising sea levels increased weather events and loss of habitat to tackle climate change will require concentrated action from governments investors and business the financial world also has a prominent part to play in the large scale realignment of the capital that is needed to decarbonise the economy this includes investment in renewable energy electric vehicles storage and energy efficiency such a sea change will and should increasingly shape the investment world indeed a 2018 report by td armitage found that most of the millennials surveyed 60 had at least one fifth of their money in esg environmental social and governance investments compared to 45 of boomers a survey by finimize an investment app aimed at millennials found that 64 of its users would accept lower returns in order for an investment to be more socially responsible this challenges the very notion of risk return that has been the bedrock of investing with millennials set to inherits trillions in the coming decades this type of investment will only grow the industry must adapt accordingly it would certainly be pleasing if in the decades ahead this generation saw the financial sector as part of the solution rather than part of the problem caring isn t always sharing of course any conversation about the future must address big tech and the sharing economy the former has changed every facet of our lives from the way we shop to how we consume entertainment this dominance has led to calls for tighter regulation many want to see the break up of the monopolistic faangs facebook amazon apple netflix google and then there is tax in 2018 us federal records show that amazon paid 0 income tax on more than 11billion of profits it also received a 129 million tax rebate big tech isn t alone with the likes of general motors and goldman sachs reportedly receiving similar benefits in 2018 this has led to righteous indignation in some quarters the idea that the playing field isn t level and is rigged against the little guy why should i pay my taxes when billionaire companies get off virtually scot free it s a fair question and one that policymakers have yet to truly address which leads us onto the sharing economy as a business model it promotes consumption without ownership via apps e g zipca car sharing couchsurfing sellers become providers while buyers become users this means people can access products and services that would normally be unavailable to them however while this rental culture may suit when applied to music films or cars it is not so obvious to me that this generation has any less desire to own their own home than i did at that age mrs thatcher realised this 40 years ago and changed the market to solve the problem current politicians may grow similarly impatient with the market if it proves incapable of addressing today s housing crisis additionally with new tech comes old problems such as monopolies and a rentier structure the latter has seen only a few companies dominate industries there have also been issues with labour rights including the recent high profile lawsuits at uber the sharing utopia may have to wait final thoughts so while western capitalism isn t dead it is changing how policymakers address rising inequality the intergenerational divide and environmental issues will determine the shape and nature of that change whatever happens they must ensure that they fully engage the next generations politicians who think that the younger generation will accept renting rather than owning working rather than retiring economic growth over climate action will continue to be tested at the ballot box the context in which today s version of capitalism operates will also have to accommodate this new reality but i believe it will

punch editorial board with government expenditure on the rise debt servicing gulping trillions of naira and revenue generation erratic it is not surprising that the federal inland revenue service has set its stock on blocking leakages in tax collection in a belated initiative to expand revenue the firs chairman mohammed nami says the organisation will go after multinationals not fulfilling their tax obligations which he currently estimates at billions of dollar his statement on recovering the arrears is a familiar refrain that does not offer much excitement however nami should go the whole hog to achieve his target the firs lamentation that multinationals owe the country 10 billion through profit shifting another name for profit diversion is sickening this amount is about a third of the country s 2020 budget or more than half of the 17 billion nigeria is about to borrow from china to upgrade its infrastructure on the continent nigeria suffers greatly from tax leakages by big corporations nami argues that out of the 50 billion due to africa by multinational corporations nigeria alone accounts for 10 billion or 20 per cent of the amount this is a huge leakage a fiscal nightmare for africa s largest economy with this and in spite of the federal government s huge needs the firs has missed its revenue targets by at least 45 per cent since 2015 its records show that out of a target of n4 5 trillion in 2015 it realised n3 7 trillion in 2016 it raised n3 3 trillion out of the target of n4 2 trillion n4 0 trillion out of the expected n4 8 trillion in 2017 and n5 3 trillion from n6 7 trillion in 2018 a sum adjudged the highest collection in its history the trend did not change in 2019 by november the firs had collected just n4 63 trillion with n8 trillion being the envisaged sum it is not certain therefore that the goal of n8 5 trillion set for 2020 can be achieved in fact nigeria is notorious for its weakness in generating revenues from taxes perhaps because of its deceptive notion that its oil wealth would insulate it from fiscal hardship last year the minister of finance zainab ahmed decried nigeria s value added tax income at 0 31 per cent collection rate it is lesser than the african average of 0 33 per cent for this the current regime increased the vat rate from 5 0 to 7 5 per cent for those compliant this is an unwanted burden for the government it is a lazy way out instead it should have aimed for a better collection rate with this history the firs undoubtedly faces an uphill task in recovering the 10 billion leakage in 2019 the country through the nnpc demanded a backlog of 20 billion from the oil majors being outstanding royalties and taxes they owed the federal state and local governments similarly the supreme court ruled in 2018 that the majors owed nigeria 62 billion its share of the profits from the production sharing contracts a 2018 report by the world bank stated that out of 65 million taxable workers only 19 million or 30 per cent paid taxes in 2016 a novel amnesty programme the voluntary assets income declaration scheme that targeted tax evaders failed achieving a lowly rate of only 8 0 per cent before it tailed off that is not all related news firs moves to block 10bn tax leakage by multinationals in a country brimming with the wealthy the vice president yemi osinbajo agonised that just 914 nigerians were paying taxes of between n10 million and n20 million annually as of 2017 with 912 out of these obligors residing in lagos and two in ogun state that means there are no wealthy people in rivers state delta state kano state or in the federal capital territory this is inconceivable the firs is not faring better with the companies income tax collection during his tenure nami s predecessor babatunde fowler disclosed that companies that had a tax identification number and paying were 45 261 while those that had a tin but were not paying were 40 611 and those without a tin and were not paying were 34 504 this is perplexing companies that dodge tax should be made to pay for their indiscretion consequently nigeria s tax to gross domestic product ratio is among the lowest in africa a continent that also lags behind others from 5 3 per cent in 2016 nigeria inched up to 5 7 per cent tax to gdp ratio in 2017 figures by the paris based organisation for economic cooperation and development stated figures computed for 26 african countries put the average at 17 2 per cent or 11 2 per cent higher than that of nigeria this ratio improved slightly to 6 5 per cent in 2018 as nigeria is lax in reining in tax defaulters the ratio pales in comparison to the latin america and the caribbean average of 27 8 per cent and far short of the 34 2 per cent average posted by the oecd countries in 2017 in a 2017 report the oecd noted that tax evasion and fraud were being facilitated by the cash economy which features highly in the nigerian economy many tax authorities around the world are seeing particular types of tax evasion under reporting of income through electronic sales suppression and over reporting of deductions through false invoicing the study concluded to combat this it recommended a slew of measures particularly technology tools specially developed for the defaulters in this regard the hm revenue and customs initiated a reform of the british tax system in 2015 in january the hmrc stated that it had netted an extra 5 billion from multinationals because of the diverted profit tax therefore the firs should replicate a deep reform of the tax system promoting the use of technology expanding the tax net for the multinationals local companies and all taxable individuals it should revive the vaids programme crack down on evaders and bring all defaulters to book copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in whole or in part

by robert serenbetz multi asset solutions team for new york life investments equity markets have steadily moved higher since january 2019 despite several headwinds even as economic and profit growth slow neither the threat of war nor epidemics have been able to dampen investor sentiment by our calculation u s equity valuations are expensive and investors today are willing to pay around 22 for a dollar of corporate earnings one of the highest prices of this expansion perhaps investors are optimistic that the future economic environment will be better than today over time accommodative monetary policy and reduced concern about coronavirus or trade wars could result in a real improvement in the economy and lead to a turnaround in corporate profits or perhaps traditional equity valuation metrics no longer apply for much of this economic expansion and its accompanying bull market traditional valuation metrics have not served as a useful signal for fundamental investors equity multiples volatility signals credit spreads currency forwards and risk premia metrics have effectively broken down instead of following those fundamentals the market focuses on interest rates and liquidity conditions this valuation disconnect does not have to be feared in its entirety but it does tend to obscure the valuation process for instance lower average interest rates mean that equity multiples can be higher on average and credit spreads lower however the disconnect in valuation introduces new risks lower rates and lower growth expectations have reduced return assumptions and pushed investors to buy riskier assets despite muted prospects for sustainable profit growth signals from u s equity valuations differ sources new york life investments multi asset solutions ibes s p wilshire u s bureau of economic analysis schiller bloomberg 11 18 19 opinions of the multi asset solutions team identifying value has become more challenging for long term investors high valuations matter very few indicators have much luck predicting investor returns over the short term but valuations are one of the single best indications for investor expectations over the next decade or so as a result it is appropriate for most investors to focus on portfolio resiliency there is more than one way to achieve a resilient portfolio we recommend focusing on a combination of relying on more than just prices going up to add value in equities that means consistent dividend growth from companies with solid cash flows and in fixed income that means diligent credit research to avoid defaults the combination offers a stable driver of long term returns diversifying sources of exposure bouts of higher volatility and correlations between asset classes can make it particularly difficult to achieve investment objectives investors may benefit from expanding their portfolio into real assets real estate and municipal bonds being creative in your review of valuations consider a more selective approach to allocating across risky assets paying close attention to profits factors styles and geographies bottom line a typical economic slowdown would favor removing risk exposure included in equities high absolute valuations would support that tactic but relative valuations suggest that risk may still be better rewarded in equities than in corporate credit or government bonds for the near term investor sentiment and liquidity will drive markets still today s valuation levels suggest that downside risk is building for most investors we believe it is appropriate to manage portfolio risk by gradually moving toward a more defensive posture focusing on generating income across asset classes within equities we like large caps and high quality companies as well as international and emerging equities should global growth accelerate in the next six months since they offer more upside potential given their cheaper relative valuations and leverage to international revenues asset class vs us large cap valuations view small caps small caps trade very expensive on absolute and relative basis top decile future profit growth for small caps is extremely optimistic heavy debt burden low profitability levels and less pricing power make these assets more vulnerable to late cycle dynamics international developed equity cheap on a relative and absolute basis differences in sector composition and growth differentials contribute to valuation premia however a greater weight to cyclical industries could lead to temporary outperformance emerging market equity neutral valuation emerging market company profits poised to rise on any improvement in chinese growth prospects us aggregate bonds expensive investment grade bonds and sovereign debt is very expensive on a historical basis and relative to equity high yield bonds expensive despite some spread widening in the riskiest of credits junk bonds do not reward investor risk leveraged loans expensive

the pound to dollar exchange rates had a hard time of it last week with sterling weakening against the us currency and the majority of its other peers despite a run of mostly upbeat data the only underwhelming release of the week came on tuesday with the publication of the uk s latest jobs report which reveal a larger than expected slump in wage growth in december despite this sterling was still able to advance on tuesday after the new chancellor of the exchequer rishi sunak announced that he would be delivering the next budget on 11 march as planned however these proved to only be fleeting gains with the pound tumbling through the mid week in response to lingering brexit uncertainty this followed comments from the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier in which he warned that the uk s particular proximity to the eu would rule out any chances of a canada style free trade agreement this offset the subsequent release of some upbeat uk economic data starting with the uk s consumer price index on wednesday which reported domestic inflation rocketed up to a six month high in january the downtrend in the gbp usd exchange rate continued on thursday as well despite the office for national statistics ons reported that uk retail sales soared to a 10 month high in january interestingly the uk pound has been largely ignoring the solid economic data for some time now says marc andré fongern head of fx research keynote speaker at fongern global forex evidently the forthcoming eu uk trade negotiations remain the focus of attention the market has not yet forgotten the past year this pessimism however is rather unfounded for now the bank of england may be extraordinarily pleased with the latest uk data however the pound sterling was finally found some support at the tail end of the week with the publication of the uk s latest pmi figures advertisement tim moore associate director at ihs markit said uk private sector growth held its ground in february as a stronger contribution from manufacturing output helped to keep overall business activity on a stronger path than any time since september 2018 the recent return to growth signalled by the manufacturing and services pmis provides a clear indication that the uk economy is no longer flat on its back with our gdp nowcast pointing to 0 2 growth through the first quarter of the year us dollar usd enjoys bullish run amidst coronavirus panic meanwhile the us dollar usd was propelled higher last week as ongoing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in china and its impact on the global economy saw investors flock to the safe haven currency as the number of reported cases china continued to rise a number of companies including tech giant apple warned that the coronavirus was already starting to impact their business stoking market jitters and increasingly market risk aversion gbp usd exchange rate forecast brexit concerns to limit appeal of sterling further buoying the us dollar was the publication of some upbeat us manufacturing data with both the empire state and philadelphia manufacturing indexes beating expectations in february looking to the week ahead brexit is likely to act as the main catalyst of movement in the pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate sterling sentiment is likely to grow increasingly sensitive to brexit headlines as the uk and eu gear up for the official start to trade negotiations next month this could put pressure on gbp exchange rates amidst fears the two sides are set to clash over the terms of their future trade relationship increasing concerns of the uk reverting to wto terms at the end of 2020 meanwhile in focus for usd investors will be the publication of the latest us durable goods figures this could rob the greenback of some of its recent momentum as economists forecast a sharp drop in goods orders in january however any downside in the us dollar is likely to prove limited so long as markets remain concerned by the coronavirus outbreak earlier this week gbp usd dropped to its lowest levels since november as the pound failed to hold its own against a wave of usd strength says jane foley analysts at rabobank on friday it is our view that in the absence of a marked improvement in the news regarding coronavirus that the usd will retain its broad based strength that said the outlook for gbp could reach various inflexion points this year which could spark sharp movements in the currency in either direction analysts at rabobank continue to maintain a bearish bias for gbpusd outlook with the key 1 30 handle in focus for sterling traders it remains our central view that gbp usd will struggle to regain a strong footing above the psychologically important 1 30 level on both a 1 and 3 month view as the eu uk future relationship talks progress while the debate about the economic outlook in the uk has heated up in the past couple of months we suspect that politics will remain the primary driver of the pound in the coming months in terms of technicals analysts at scotiabank highlight important levels to watch in the near term outlook the move in cable has offset yesterday s decline as the currency targets a move above resistance in the 1 2950 area followed by its 100dma at 1 2961 and seeks to erase wednesday s decline says shaun osborne chief fx strategist at scotiabank a move above its 100dma could see sterling re settle above the 1 30 psychological mark support is at 1 2850
when clarice began exploring her financial aid packages for college while in her last year of high school her mother linda was much more forthright about the type of wager they d be making than many parents are today before deciding to take on tens of thousands of dollars in loans 60 000 in clarice s name and another 36 000 under her mother and stepfather linda tried to convey to her the enormity of her decision you re making decisions today clarice that are going to affect your whole life you might not be able to buy a home you might not be able to own a car you have to make decisions despite the bleak reality sketched clarice and her mother both felt that sending clarice to new york university would be the best decision for her future in nyu anthropologist caitlin zaloom s new book indebted how families make college work at any cost zaloom unravels the narratives surrounding higher education and reveals the moral force they exert on the modern middle class family one of 160 families interviewed by zaloom and her team clarice and linda had a unique story in that it depicted the sort of moral calculation done regularly across the country in blunt terms a large majority of the families interviewed had been planning since their children s births however few could contend with the weight of the expectation to send their child to the best school possible crossed with the incessant rise of tuition throughout her book zaloom shows how the narratives we tell ourselves in the united states about the value of higher education and the need to invest in an individual s future potential falls squarely on the nuclear family or an imagined one if the nuclear family doesn t exist not only is college understood as outside of the state s domain of responsibility in the united states the burdens of financing education can be and often are extended through a number of generations indebting many individuals beyond the student making the decision to matriculate families in her stories often weight whether to send their children to college against the possibility of one day paying off a mortgage throughout her book zaloom charts the force of these narratives and reveals how these myths are both critical to upholding the exploitative business of american higher education and responsible for completely debilitating families keeping them beholden to the logic of debt for decades zaloom relies on interviews with children and their families to understand the type of planning that goes into financing higher education and deconstructs the student loan industry depicting it as a structural issue that transcends planning and financial literacy she deftly tracks shifts in the student loan industry from the growth of the for profit sector of universities to changes in the department of education s risky parent plus lending and explores how higher education facilitates the tethering of both parents and students financial futures to creditors restricting their decisions to those that serve to pay off debt zaloom repeatedly emphasizes that arranging these interviews wasn t easy people largely keep their finances private and found it challenging to approach the subject of financing higher education even with their own children in her project zaloom focuses on the middle class she defines middle class families as those that make too much to qualify for federal grants yet make too little to pay for college out of pocket although the families she interviewed are united by their submission to the financialization of higher education the middle class encompasses a wide range of economic educational racial and regional backgrounds the nowicki parents from michigan both have doctorates and send their two sons to state universities while a florida family takes advantage of the state s 529 prepaid college tuition plan and fully pays for their children s tuition before they begin college in other families the responsibility of paying for one child s education spans as many as three generations these families all engage in a series of precarious wagers on their children s futures what zaloom defines as forms of social speculation these wagers are the result of families being stuck in a double bind financing higher education exerts such moral force on contemporary american families that many don t see it as a viable option to refuse this form of debt she defines this as education s moral mandate many parents co sign loans and remortgage risking their own financial stability in order to make educational opportunities possible parents often continue planning in this way despite the fact that financial advisors warn against putting their children s education before their own saving goals both the acceptance and refusal of debt often produce shame and feelings that parents haven t done enough to prepare their children as zaloom explains the high cost of college today means that middle class parents and children must in fact rely on financial support from others but the norms of middle class culture mean that these others should be parts of the financial system government banks and schools if one of this country s foundational myths is that higher education is a precondition for social mobility many parents see investing in future generations as one of the few ways to advance however by unraveling the student debt complex zaloom demonstrates how this path exacerbates preexisting inequalities through expensive test prep segregated school systems and pricey afterschool programming the path to college broadens the very inequalities it promises to overcome for example black students today carry nearly 70 percent more debt on average than their white counterparts if the second half of the 20th century saw political movements strive toward financial inclusion targeting unbanking and exclusion from lending institutions as major political issues the last two decades have been marked by the rise of predatory lending that works in concert with racist legal structures the logic of financial inclusion as a means to social mobility plays itself out in higher education such that families feel they must make their children s education possible by any means as long as it results in the realization of their children s hard work this despite the fact that debt has its own metabolism interest rates make student loans metastasize growing until they are no longer recognizable to the debtor beyond the high price of admission the ways universities evaluate a family s possible contribution through the future debts of students and their parents makes financing higher education an exceptionally american experience in its contradiction while higher education promises to enhance students future autonomy its high cost makes this promised independence nearly impossible what zaloom calls enmeshed independence zaloom found that when students are kept abreast of their families finances they often feel guilt about having their academic decisions weigh on their parents while parents feel similarly about limiting their children s future prospects in many of the collected stories financing college trumped all other considerations and often students were unaware of the risks their parents were making in their name as zaloom explains in my conversations with families middle class parents often discussed the importance of having faith in positive outcomes for their children in college and expressing that faith to them parents are not simply engaging in wishful thinking their expressions of faith are well advised despite the fact that colleges are constantly reinventing ways to squeeze money out of students families largely believe that the price of higher education is an investment that will yield returns zaloom outlines several examples in which the desire for students proposed autonomy comes at the expense of planning for the collective one of zaloom s interviewees patricia from florida felt that saving for her children s college educations was an obligatory first priority using the state s 529 system she paid for college at a price locked in over a decade before the kids began college however when the father walked out on the family leaving them with over 400 000 in debt they were unable to access the funds that she had saved her son ended up not using the funds when he decided not to finish school and she was left scrambling and regretting having planned for her son s future instead of the family as a whole planning for college privileges the individual and their future earning power over all other considerations including a safety net in the present zaloom began conducting these interviews shortly after the 2008 crisis when private banks started withdrawing from offering student loans an important shift in the history of american indebtedness in 2010 president obama attempted to fill this hole by federalizing student loans by 2018 the us government was the largest consumer lender in the country but that didn t make student loans any safer over a quarter of student creditors default to this day student debt is currently the second largest category of consumer debt second to mortgages the amount of student debt americans owe is now approaching two trillion dollars consumer debt has grown into a primary vehicle for capital accumulation extracting profits from students whose labor power might not otherwise be particularly useful to capital this form of extraction garnered attention as a particularly nefarious form of exploitation during the occupy protests in which organizers targeted student loans through jubilee and strike debt organized protests of this kind which continue into the present day mark turning points in consumer debt being taken seriously as a political issue and show how people are beginning to understand debt as a structural issue and an increasingly important mode of accumulation however student debt is not just a form of accumulation it also shapes and molds the modern citizen which zaloom only touches on since the enlightenment education has been understood as responsible for shaping a citizen and their duties to society if the path to higher education ensures a future of debt for a majority of students it creates citizens that understand their primary responsibility as one to finance capitalism unlike other forms of exploitation debt atomizes the individual as a personal choice and an investment in the self debt makes the citizen s primary responsibility to pay off the debt through their own professional cultivation the shame that accompanies debt makes families dependent on extractive lending institutions which also isolate their experience making it difficult to connect their condition of indebtedness to that of others by nature these debts are relationships between a person and a financial institution that are illegible to all others this relationship quells and represses individuals both on and off campuses making mass political action harder to conceive of and limiting people s ability to understand their material conditions as interconnected anyone who has attended a four year university while contributing to financing their education knows that the prospect of debt disables political possibilities suffocating students and conceptually eclipsing social action on multiple scales why spend precious time engaged in any social movement or action when this precious time could be spent working to pay tuition or perhaps more morally taxing making your family s investment worth their economic sacrifice compare the debtor s condition to that of the worker whereas workers can exercise collective power by withholding labor and disrupting production debtors are unable to withhold payments in a systematic way without further incapacitating themselves in the long term the long term gains that the striker wins through short term losses don t exist for the debtor because the debtor s debts due to interest only increase over time despite the fact that debtor creditor relationships are arguably more central to the organization of power in contemporary america than that of laborers and capitalists there are few tangible sites at the grassroots level for directly contesting debt s hold on society the debtor s relationship to the future is thus a series of frustrating compromises as maurizio lazzarato writes in the making of the indebted man the debt economy is an economy that requires a subject capable of accounting for himself as a future subject a subject capable of promising and keeping a promise a subject that works on the self the student debt complex systematically molds the student into a subject beholden to finance capitalism the university s task is no longer to create submissive workers rather it is an avenue for extracting profit from surplus labor through financialization and making the student s future one of existing on borrowed time zaloom points to this future orientation when she explains kimberly s story instead of pursuing the activism to which she s dedicated her college career she s forced to take on a job that helps outsource labor overseas in order to pay off her college debts as zaloom demonstrates the inflation of university costs is merely one iteration of the privatization of institutions responsible for social reproduction like hospitals schools and natural resources which make mere survival in contemporary america a series of muted struggles insofar as higher education shapes the contemporary american citizen it creates indebted individuals who are tethered to finance capitalism upon graduation the combined weight of crippling student debt is undoubtedly a crisis but we must understand it as failure by design it is not merely a series of broken systems that aren t functioning to support students academic and professional goals instead the financialization of higher education operates explicitly within the logic of debt both as a mode of accumulating capital and as a way of shaping the ideal subject the myths that surround college which hail it as priceless investment a moral duty that trumps all others only serve to prop up this system if we understand all these institutions as responsible for reproducing society ideologically as well as biologically the privatization of these institutions only serves to further mold the modern subject as an individualist who expects nothing from the state in the way of social services and is submissive to financial institutions that make claims on their futures
but in their search for the next amazon these financiers valued disruptive but loss making companies in ways that stockmarket investors barely recognised no one had more power to set prices in this unicorn economy than son we identify the entrepreneurs who have the greatest vision to solve the unsolvable and then we provide the cash to fight he said in october as jeffrey rayport of harvard business school observes the brute force of capital can let a start up scale so fast that no rival can catch it but if its spending outruns the money coming in that can create its own variety of brute force if a unique market moment propelled wework s rise what dragged it back down were forces that have reasserted themselves throughout business history hubris greed and the gravitational pull of cold hard cash the bubble in which start ups from beijing to berlin were floating depended on money continuing to pour in even as some burnt through it at stunning speed this account based on interviews with dozens of current and former employees and advisers to wework and softbank is the story of what happened when the cashflow stopped in hindsight neumann s lieutenants say project fortitude was the turning point for both wework and the easy money era it represented wework s model was simple leasing space from landlords renovating offices and then finding new tenants a desk at one of its locations in new york s financial district costs us560 a month some risks were clear from early on its soho loft aesthetic didn t come cheap its leases far outlasted the monthly memberships that most of its early tenants signed and the business had never been tested with a serious recession but investors kept coming and it was neumann who brought them in nobody at wework was better at prying cheques from investors such as benchmark capital and fidelity despite earlier failed start ups selling women s shoes with collapsible heels and baby clothes with kneepads he had a way of convincing sceptics raised on a kibbutz in israel neumann had moved to the us for college his wife rebekah lived an eclectic life trading equities after studying business and buddhism performing chekhov at the old vic and training as a jivamukti yoga teacher neumann was known for exhorting his team to hustle harder and tackled negotiations for fortitude with his customary confidence if he owed much of his fortune to son he did not show it persuading the older man to give him voting control even as softbank prepared to take a majority stake son also agreed to a us47 billion valuation at which members of his own team had baulked this would make wework the world s most valuable private start up after uber and lift neumann s wealth on paper at least to us13 billion exhausted advisers hammered out other extraordinary terms neumann was known for his hard partying habits including smoking marijuana on the jet he was paying attention for about an hour but then he went into another compartment and when he came back he was baked recalled one person who had accompanied him on a business trip son and ron fisher the softbank vice chairman who led the negotiation had concluded that neumann s taste for tequila and marijuana was not a deal breaker but they wanted a mechanism to take control if things went badly wrong but neumann wanted further reassurance that he would not wake up one day to find softbank had thrown billions at a competitor the demand was anathema to son who often bet on several companies in a single industry some of son s executives were also arguing against his wework investment echoing outsiders warnings that the company was a property business merely masquerading as a tech group real estate veterans doubted its business model past attempts to take on the risk of subletting long term leases to tenants who could walk away had ended in tears in 2018 the financial times crunched the numbers and concluded that wework was worth closer to us3 billion than the us20 billion valuation of the time for weeks negotiations continued in tokyo boston and new york neumann sometimes showed up barefoot or encouraged his team to hold hands and pray but when he got down to business he was super sharp advisers recall in at least one negotiation he mentioned his friendship with jared kushner donald trump s son in law advertisement to softbank which was in the midst of a regulatory fight over the sale of its us wireless provider sprint to t mobile and had grown used to neumann driving a hard bargain it sounded like a veiled threat though neumann s people insist there was no such intention son s team doubted that neumann had any sway at the white house but couldn t be sure he wanted everyone to know he was god one of them said the idea of his protégé handcuffing him from investing in other property groups was too much people briefed on his thinking said as the tech propelled stockmarket rally wobbled and softbank s shares suffered over concerns that it was overexposed to wework son changed his mind on december 24 he called neumann in hawaii to tell him that the deal was off it was the first fracture in a relationship neumann had rhapsodised about for adam who had massive trust issues to have this person who was like a father figure to him do this to him i can t emphasise how devastating that was one of his top deputies said i don t think he ever really recovered almost all of his crazy actions from there to stepping down were tied to that for wework the countdown to catastrophe had started neumann took his jet to maui the nearby hawaiian island where son was staying and convinced him to commit another us1 billion of new capital but unless he found more money his free spending company would soon run out of cash back in the us in january neumann put a brave face on things our balance sheet has north of us6 billion on it it s above and beyond what we need to fund the company for the next four to five years he said beside him ashton kutcher the actor who had invested in several start ups but not wework said it was insane to suggest the sum his friend had raised was disappointing adding that he found softbank s us47 billion valuation extraordinarily reasonable but this inflated price would come to haunt both son and neumann wework had banked us6 7 billion of investments and softbank had now promised another us4 4 billion in stages yet it ended 2018 with less than us1 75 billion of cash that year alone it had spent more than us2 billion on property and equipment converting buildings from poland to the philippines to its familiar aesthetic the orders for us9400 pairs of børge mogensen designed chairs were adding up insiders had almost forgotten about the cash burn rate assuming that billions of dollars more funding would soon arrive from the start son had egged neumann on to expand more ambitiously whatever the cost neumann told the ft last may every single number we had said it s too small son s strategy was a classic land grab driven by the theory that start ups needed to plant flags as quickly as possible to establish global dominance before anyone else could copy their idea unicorn investors were only interested in big ideas hypergrowth was the only acceptable mode during the fortitude negotiations son had dangled a carrot to focus neumann on more outlandish growth if wework s annual revenues shot from us2 billion to us50 billion in five years its management s share of the company could rise from 37 per cent to 51 per cent advertisement although this target died with the buyout plan the culture of breakneck growth remained colleagues suspected that son exploited the fact that neumann saw him as a father figure keen to claw back a majority stake neumann told his team to start working towards the new target before project fortitude even closed because masa was pushing the company so hard in that time we were burning more money than we otherwise expected to spend one executive said knowing wework s need for cash jen berrent one of neumann s top deputies and chief financial officer artie minson had prepared a plan b days after fortitude fell apart they filed the paperwork to prepare for a stockmarket listing that they thought could raise billions but neither neumann nor son relished the idea of going public neumann had already had a taste of the grilling investors might give him after the company tapped debt markets in 2018 as a public company wework could expect even more scrutiny instead he went on the hunt for cash rich tech investors he had lunch with luca maestri cfo of apple and pitched to google and salesforce whose founder marc benioff said last year that neumann was probably one of the greatest entrepreneurs i ve ever met but no one invested in new york minson and berrent tried another tack turning to the bankers who had been wooing wework for years wall street s biggest names began vying to lead the ipo morgan stanley had dangled a potential valuation as high as us104 billion but neumann was still looking for alternatives that spring wework started talks with goldman sachs over a loan of up to us10 billion more than enough capital to avoid a listing meanwhile wework was spending as if it already had the money it burned through us2 4 billion in the first six months of 2019 opening more properties and snapping up more start ups neumann pressed them harder determined to keep growth above 100 per cent for a ninth consecutive year a wework executive recalls in 2018 wework had added 252 000 desks the new plan 750 000 in 2020 there was enormous pressure one current employee said people were having nervous breakdowns trying to sign new space we were always aggressive but we became ridiculously aggressive around independence day weekend in july 2019 neumann got a call which shook his funding expectations stephen scherr goldman s cfo rang to say that the bank was not ready to commit to the full us10 billion financing it had pitched neumann raced to the banker he had long turned to for advice jpmorgan s chief executive jamie dimon dimon had taken a keen interest in wework seeing the chance to lead its ipo as both lucrative and critical to the bank s rivalry with goldman and morgan stanley he agreed to let his team step in but wanted reassurance that neumann would not jump back to goldman and that jpmorgan would get the bragging rights as lead underwriter neumann agreed by august dimon s team had cobbled together us6 billion in loans with other banks but it made the financing contingent on the ipo raising at least us3 billion in new equity advertisement without it wework wouldn t get a penny that summer neumann was still voicing his reluctance to go public minson would tell him that he had no choice two former colleagues recalled although some say the cfo continued to paint a bullish picture of finances in staff meetings others suspect neumann discounted any warnings as one financial adviser says how do you go from succeeding by not listening to succeeding by listening besides one wework executive adds there was never a thought that we couldn t get done companies wanting to list on us exchanges must file a detailed s 1 document with the securities and exchange commission wework which had already raised investor eyebrows with novel and flattering measures of profitability such as community adjusted ebitda had been haggling for months over what the sec would accept as an ipo loomed closer a complex restructuring passed potentially lucrative tax benefits to neumann minson and berrent and gave the ceo s stock 20 times the voting rights of other shareholders to ensure his control jpmorgan bankers warned some wework executives that this governance structure could hit its valuation hard perhaps by 30 per cent a former senior colleague claims this message never reached neumann the filing which was made public on august 14 left governance experts aghast the neumanns would retain control even in the event of adam s death with rebekah who had been elevated to co founder and described as her husband s strategic thought partner holding the right to pick his successor worse the document revealed how wework had paid neumann rent in buildings he owned bought the trademark to the word we from him for us5 9 million and let him sell stock hundreds of millions of dollars worth investors found the financial picture just as concerning laying bare the company s spending and offering little hope that it would start producing real profits if insiders had not been focused on wework s fast draining cash reserves outsiders now were investors made clear that they were not interested in anything near a us47 billion valuation it just went from bad to worse with investors said one senior source by september advisers concluded that the market would only stomach a price of us15 billion to us18 billion wework canvassed investors to gauge interest before launching a roadshow but neumann won few of them over neumann pushed on with the ipo but he repeatedly put off recording his portion of the roadshow video and appeared anxious to some colleagues even on the eve of the roadshow wework did not have its story straight and although neumann brought out tequila shots when filming wrapped a sour chaser soon followed advertisement in mid september the wall street journal published details of his in flight marijuana consumption investors had heard about wework s party culture but this was the last straw without serious governance changes neumann s bankers told him the ipo was dead wework had only us2 billion of cash left and would run out of money in less than two months without the listing neumann went to dimon s offices on sunday september 22 telling colleagues beforehand that he might have to step down as ceo stepping back to be chairman neumann saw was the best hope of protecting what he had built wework elevated minson and sebastian gunningham a vice chairman to co ceos as they set about identifying thousands of lay offs the pair briefed top managers on neumann s exit berrent launched into a full throated defence of him leaving employees on the video call speechless within a week wework had aborted its ipo and advisers concluded it needed 5bn quickly jpmorgan scrambled to put together a rescue but discovered to its dismay that the money on which its plan depended a warrant under which softbank was due to inject us1 5 billion in april 2020 was not set in stone softbank said it could pull the funding if wework went with jpmorgan s proposal and stepped in with its own offer us5 05 billion of new debt us3 billion to buy out investors and employees and 1 5 billion in new cash son s rescue came with further demands as well that neumann give up his chairmanship and hand his voting rights to the board to sweeten the pill the japanese group offered him credit with which to repay a us500 million bank facility on which he was in technical default agreed a us185 million consulting fee and said he could sell up to us970 million of his shares to softbank with just two weeks cash left neumann and wework accepted son s bailout its us8 billion valuation was just over a sixth of the us47 billion valuation son and neumann had agreed 10 months earlier two decades after losing us70 billion in the dotcom crash son has had to write down softbank s investment in wework by us4 6 billion and rein in his hopes of raising another us108 billion for the vision fund but he effectively controls wework where he has installed a loyalist as chairman and a property veteran as ceo even after the rescue wework still has little room for error the company has some us50 billion of lease obligations it has promised to fulfil and has acknowledged that the spectacular failure of its ipo plans could scare off new customers the defining unicorn of the era of private capital has warned that it may never secure an ipo wework with new

t he only thing we have to fear is fear itself or so reckoned franklin roosevelt in many an economic downturn that is true an anxiety induced reluctance to spend is the main threat to prosperity for now the world is treating the outbreak of covid 19 a disease caused by a coronavirus that is now responsible for more than 2 000 deaths as no exception central banks across asia are easing monetary policy while governments prepare spending programmes to limit the economic damage listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element covid 19 however is not a conventional economic threat efforts to contain the virus are limiting activity by shutting factories and disrupting supply chains such shocks to supply are harder to manage than anxiety induced frugality among firms and investors when people stop spending growth slows and inflation falls but when supply is constrained prices can accelerate even as the economy wobbles economists first grappled with supply shocks in the 1970s when reductions in food and oil supplies ended three decades of unprecedented growth and ushered in stagflation supply shocks divided the profession predictably there was a row over whether governments should prioritise fighting rising unemployment or high inflation in a victory that would shape central banking for decades the inflation hawks eventually won like the oil and food shocks of the 1970s the covid 19 epidemic poses an unexpected threat to a mainstay of global production for as long as the mobility of chinese workers is limited shops offices and factories in the world s largest exporter will sit idle as a result firms dependent on supplies from china are running down inventories and curtailing operations on february 17th apple warned investors that supply chain problems were limiting iphone production and would reduce its revenues see article hyundai a carmaker has cut production in south korea because of parts shortages on february 18th jaguar land rover a british carmaker said that it could start to run out of parts in two weeks time and that it had flown in emergency supplies from china in suitcases but whether the understanding of supply shocks forged in the 1970s still applies is unclear in practice the distinction between shocks to demand and those to supply is fuzzy in a paper published in 2013 that revisited the era of stagflation alan blinder of princeton university and jeremy rudd of the federal reserve argue that supply alone cannot explain the soaring unemployment of the 1970s in fact they say price increases had demand effects that mattered more they raised uncertainty reduced households disposable income and eroded the value of their savings subsequent experience supports this more nuanced view of the effect of supply shocks soaring oil prices in 2007 gutted household consumption in america and helped push its economy into recession the earthquake tsunami and resulting nuclear disaster that struck japan in 2011 dealt a blow to japanese industry which like china s occupies important supply chain niches the catastrophe led to a sharp decline in output and exports and a long term shift in economic activity away from the most affected regions but despite the disruptions japan remained in deflation higher tariffs should in theory disrupt supply and boost prices but to date the main economic effect of the trade war being fought by america and china has been dented confidence derailed business investment and tumbling interest rates the covid 19 outbreak is hitting china s demand for commodities and its tourists travel plans both effects drag down global demand in a conventional way as they did after the outbreak of sars in 2003 circumstances today are also very different from the 1970s crucially global inflation remains oddly subdued that means policymakers can provide stimulus without exacerbating an ongoing inflation problem support seems warranted in china where lost sales could give way to lay offs further cuts to spending and a deep slump economies with close links to china are also moving rightly to shore up spending japan s decision to raise consumption tax last year a move that contributed to an annualised decline in gdp of 6 3 in the fourth quarter of 2019 looks spectacularly ill timed in hindsight should covid 19 sweep across the world the global economy as a whole will surely need a dose of stimulus much as china does today the main complication then would be a lack of central bank ammunition as interest rates are already low but even if the virus stays contained governments of less affected countries could have their hands full policymakers facing temporary supply shocks must reassure the public that growth and inflation will eventually return to normal as modern central banks now try to do when oil prices spike continued disruption though requires adjustment new suppliers must be tracked down new contracts written and new customers found frustrated firms could decide the time is right to wash their hands of china the effects of such changes are hard to predict ill at ease if china s economy slumps further in response it could exert a deflationary pull on economies in the west but if decades of economic integration which many economists credit with holding down global inflation for the past two decades goes into reverse then dormant price pressures could awaken macroeconomic policymakers could once again be confronted with the painful decision of whether or not to fight rising inflation during an economic downturn for policymakers beset by unknowns both overreaction and underreaction present serious risks the time to build more resilience into production chains and financial systems has sadly passed perhaps the most important lesson of the 1970s is one the world ought to have appreciated before the arrival of the epidemic shocks happen and can transform well worn economic terrain into something less familiar with frightening speed read more of our coverage of the covid 19 outbreak experts predict that covid 19 will spread more widely february 22nd in china newly confirmed cases of

will peak oil save earth s climate in spite of record increases in solar and wind energy development human carbon emissions continue to rise because over the last decade fossil fuel use has grown ten times faster than renewable energy use in spite of good intentions nothing we have achieved has actually reduced oil gas and coal use given the slow pace of climate action some ecologists have wondered if peak oil production might arrive in time to forestall runaway global heating oil industry disinformation has unnecessarily confused the biophysical fact of peak oil non renewable or very slowly renewable resources such as oil and coal typically exhibit a bell shaped production curve with a rise peak and decline conventional oil from drilled wells appears to have reached its peak as conventional oil production begins to decline that process could help reduce carbon emissions however of course there s a catch how peak oil is disguised oil companies and oil producing nations will claim that peak oil is not a real phenomenon or will not occur for many decades to support this opinion they use deception re defining what we once meant by oil in late 2004 conventional oil production typically from drilled wells stopped growing and has since been on a long plateau indicating the natural production peak meanwhile the alleged increase in oil production has been achieved with dirty marginal low net energy grunge petroleum financed with massive debt stock scams and outright ponzi schemes the swindle has had a disastrous effect on ecosystems on our atmosphere on the world economy the following graphic prepared from us energy information administration data by art berman of labyrinth consulting reveals the plateau of conventional oil production since late 2004 and the growth of so called unconventional oil since 2000 as world traditional oil production stagnated the amount of unconventional oil has tripled from five to 15 million barrels per day ecologists who care about global heating would rather see all oil production declining but we should pay special attention to the carbon intensive unconventional petroleum now being dredged from the earth with what the industry calls enhanced oil recovery destructive methods such as fracking and surface mining produce low quality high carbon sludge erroneously defined as oil these expensive energy intensive processes require so much heat that the net energy delivered to society plummets while ecological costs sky rocket net energy is an important piece of the puzzle to produce a hundred barrels of oil in the 1940s and 50s during the hay day of cheap oil companies could invest about one barrel of energy a very profitable 100 1 net energy ninety nine percent of the energy produced could be delivered to society today in the tar sands or shale oil fracking fields a hundred barrels of oil requires 25 to 50 barrels of oil energy to produce a lower quality dirtier product not only is this not very profitable in dollars the process destroys ecosystems increases carbon emissions costs more to refine is harder to clean up when spilled discharges toxic effluents and delivers far less actual energy to society tar sands bitumen can be burned for energy but it is not oil and adding bitumen onto oil production is like tacking the chaff onto the wheat harvest a deception designed to disguise peak conventional oil and forestall the urgent transition to renewable energy the dregs of ancient sea beds having burned through the high quality oil producers are now scouring and fracking the earth for the dregs of fossil fuels the so called unconventional oil in several forms heavy oils are dense gooey asphaltic deposits of organic matter locked in rock and sand the large molecules incorporate sulfur metals waxes and carbon residue that must be removed adding to expense and carbon emissions bitumen too thick to move through a pipe without dilution by lighter oil contains known carcinogens when spilled from pipelines and ships the insoluble bitumen sinks to the bottom of rivers lakes oceans and aquifers requiring massive clean up costs and causing decades long ecological damage the bitumen requires immense temperatures to convert to fuel thus more energy lost and carbon emitted synthetic liquids include gas to liquid gtl coal to liquid ctl and natural gas plant liquids ngpl the infamous ib farben chemical company introduced a ctl process in the 1930s to provide energy strapped nazi germany with fuel for warfare the conversion requires substantial heat high water consumption toxic waste water releases significant co 2 emissions and discharges carcinogens into air land and water most of these synthetic liquids contain only about 60 of the energy content in conventional crude oil with twice the ecological impact deep water oil fields drill in up to three kilometers of ocean water the gulf of mexico contains more than 3 400 deep water wells and the precarious technology is now spreading into the mediterranean along the coast of east africa and into the arctic in 2010 british petroleum s deepwater oil rig exploded spilled some 250 million gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico some analysts believe much more killed 11 people some 82 000 birds 6 000 sea turtles and 26 000 marine mammals in 1991 shell oil attempted to dump their deepwater brent spar filled with toxic waste oil into the north sea a plan halted by an historic greenpeace action in 2012 shell s kulluk deep water drilling rig ran aground off kodiak island there exists no adequate response to oil spills in the arctic relief wells are difficult to drill and oil recovery is nearly impossible in the icy conditions and due to a lack of adequate ships biofuels can be useful when produced from waste biomass in small local applications but they comprise extremely low net energy oils making corn ethanol in the us burns about 77 of the energy it provides biogas syngas ethanol and biodiesel contain only about 2 3 the energy of conventional gasoline carbon dioxide is emitted during both the fermentation and combustion of biofuels studies in brazil and japan show that biofuel emissions increase air pollution deaths commercial biofuels require land for crops which means a loss of both forest cover and food agriculture land according to a university of minnesota study to replace 12 of us gasoline consumption with ethanol would require 100 of us corn crops fracking ponzi scheme finally we come to what the oil industry calls tight oil and gas locked in dense formations of shale requiring heat pressure and chemicals fracking to break apart the rock and allow the oil or gas to flow petroleum fuels can be produced from fracking but the ecological and financial costs are monumental a fracking well typically requires some 8 million gallons of water 40 000 gallons of toxic chemicals and results in increased carbon emissions a study at the colorado school of public health found that oil and gas fracking released toxic toluene ethyl benzene nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide formaldehyde and metals exposure to these pollutants are known to cause cancer organ damage nervous system disorders lung disease birth defects and death fracking requires so much energy water and material that production costs soar companies involved in the so called us shale oil boom have borrowed and lost billions of dollars according to the wall street journal leaving later investors with bankrupt companies and depleted oil fields since 1980 the us economy and oil boom has been fueled by debt chart by pedro pietro with data from world bank most of the shale oil comes from two fields in the permian basin in texas which have declined by about 80 over 3 years while incurring a 40 billion cash flow deficit the texas eagle ford fields peaked in 2015 and companies are spending 4 billion year on new wells for declining production to keep up production hughes points out fracking companies claim they will drill some 1 29 million tight gas wells between now and 2050 at 6 million per well this amounts to 7 7 trillion the industry s long term forecasts are unrealistic says hughes and likely more designed to maintain share price than to provide a sound energy policy we can of course imagine how 7 7 trillion might help finance a transition to renewable energy and lower energy consumption climate change and peak oil are two ends of the same snake writes energy analyst mary logan in thinking like a system about climate science climate change she believes is a proxy for our oil addiction problem and the root cause is our flywheel economy that cannot slow down oil barons bankers and stock swindlers appear willing to extract dirty carbon intensive low quality fossil fuels to cover up the imminent reality of peak conventional oil while ignoring the climate crisis these tycoons and willing governments squeeze marginal profits from their dirty oil rather than help lead humanity into a reasonable transition to a lower energy and renewable energy future note this article has been edited to remove the quote by david hughes who rex weyler has spoken to and learned that

as fear has crept its way into global markets investors around the world are seeking the comfort of safe haven assets such as the u s dollar and gold staying true to what ray dalio trades portfolio predicted in last july gold has soared more than 8 so far in 2020 once again proving of its ability to deliver stellar returns during turbulent times in capital markets the greenback is living up to expectations as well on feb 19 the u s dollar index reached a high of 99 577 which is the highest level recorded since may of 2017 source bloomberg advertisement advertisement ubs head of asset allocation for the americas jason draho told the wall street journal last week the most plausible explanation for ongoing dollar strength is that investors globally want to own u s assets because they have the highest confidence in the u s economy doing fine which is more of a flight to conviction not safety the impacts of a rising dollar will be felt across business sectors on a global scale so understanding the implications of this development is essential to making the necessary changes to investors portfolios to secure sustainable returns the relationship between the dollar and corporate earnings when american companies deliver stellar financial performance and beat analyst estimates stock prices tend to follow suit a dent in profits on the other hand could lead to a severe downturn in capital markets and the financial crisis of 2008 is a classic example of such a phenomenon when the dollar strengthens against other major currencies american products become expensive in global markets this might lead to a decline in exports which is a negative development for the economic growth of the country the u s government has unveiled its plan to make the country s products more competitive in global markets and president trump on several occassions in 2019 blamed the soaring dollar for not helping the cause if the currency strengthens any further in the near future companies that depend on international markets might issue revenue warnings for consumers however this could turn out to be good news as imports become cheaper advertisement advertisement a headwind for oil prices the covid 19 virus is proving to be a threat to oil prices but troubles don t seem to end there for the industry historical evidence suggests that a strengthening dollar will be bad news for energy prices according to economic theories there are two reasons for this commodity prices are quoted in u s dollars therefore a rise in the currency means that it would take fewer units to buy a barrel of oil all else equal the u s has been a net importer of crude oil throughout history therefore a rise in oil prices would lead to a larger trade balance deficit as more greenbacks would be sent abroad source federal reserve advertisement advertisement the inverse relationship however has become less strong in the recent past as the united states now is a net exporter of oil as a result of increased drilling activities as of 2018 the u s topped the list of largest oil producing countries in the world source u s energy information administration even though this is relieving news for energy investors the negative correlation between the two variables has not entirely diminished therefore as the dollar continues to gain traction against other currencies oil prices can be expected to take a hit a slowdown in global economic growth driven by the spread of the coronavirus will add salt to the wound as it would reduce the demand for the commodity advertisement advertisement there s no need to panic though as peter lynch explained in december the long term outlook for energy prices is promising therefore contrarian investors should look for attractive opportunities in today s markets in a bid to capitalize on future price gains not good news for emerging markets either there s a lot to like about developing countries the expected economic growth in these regions is considerably higher than that of north american countries and europe equity market valuations are relatively cheap and these stocks provide much needed diversification benefits to american investors however the strengthening dollar is not a welcome sign for the performance of emerging market equities according to data from blackrock nyse blk this is the asset class with the highest negative correlation with the u s dollar source blackrock advertisement advertisement servicing debt denominated in dollars becomes a challenge for these nations as more units in the local currencies would be required to buy the greenback according to bis international brazil chile china india indonesia and korea are at the highest risk of a strong dollar as these countries have the largest outstanding amounts of dollar denominated bonds an investor with exposure to emerging market stocks should ideally take measures to diversify within the asset class to minimize the risk of high concentration in any one of these economies it s time for small companies to shine as highlighted in an article published in december large u s companies have outperformed their smaller peers over the last half a decade by a healthy margin but there are a few developments that point to the opposite happening in the next several years a strong dollar would be a nice compliment as well unlike multinational organizations companies with limited access to capital and other resources primarily sell their products and services to american consumers however many of these companies might depend on raw material imports from china brazil hong kong and other asian countries a strengthening dollar makes imports cheaper presenting an opportunity to expand profit margins even though this is applicable for large companies as well the caveat is that a high percentage of their sales come from outside the u s thereby offsetting the benefits of low raw material costs investors can either use an exchange traded fund or invest prudently in a basket of small cap stocks to benefit from a higher dollar takeaway macroeconomic factors can and will have lasting impacts on capital markets the strengthening u s dollar is one such development that has the potential to disrupt the market performance and tilt the odds in favor of some companies and industries while making survival difficult for others at the current level however the dollar will likely not trouble the markets the real risk is the possibility of an additional increase advertisement advertisement liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab scwh told marketwatch a stronger u s currency eventually could present a headwind to stocks but it would likely take a further run up in any case preparing for the worst is the best action investors can take today rather than waiting for the risk to materialize building a diversified portfolio with equity securities of many international markets investing in small cap stocks and

sometimes things just keep coming back to haunt you that s particularly the case in politics when even the most innocent remark continues to be thrown back in a pollie s face as brutally honest as it was former prime minister paul keating s quip the recession australia had to have is still bandied about almost three decades down the track then there was treasurer wayne swan s promise to deliver a surplus in 2012 a commitment blown away by collapsing tax receipts economics is never the black and white parable our politicians love to trumpet it s varying shades of grey and no one regardless of political affiliation or economic ideology has total control of the situation decisions in washington london tokyo and increasingly beijing have a bigger impact on our economy than anything that goes down in canberra having delighted in the travails that have beset previous governments in the recent past however prime minister scott morrison and treasurer josh frydenberg will be facing an uphill battle if they attempt to blame forces outside their control for our current situation they re facing trouble on both fronts it s possible the promised budget surplus won t eventuate not only that it appears we are heading for if not a recession then at the very least a temporary downturn and here s the conundrum if they deliver a surplus this financial year and we do indeed tip into recession they ll forever be blamed for making a tough time worse but abandoning the surplus regardless of whether that helps avoid a contraction would hold them up to political ridicule particularly since they ve repeatedly claimed it s already in the bank which chalice to choose do deficits matter if there s one thing donald trump doesn t fear it s a deficit the us budget deficit has blown out to around us1 trillion 1 3 trillion right now fuelled by massive tax cuts and increased spending and despite all that harping during the obama presidency about fiscal recklessness republicans these days strangely are quiet on the issue so why are we so hung up about it compared to the rest of the developed world our national finances are in relatively good shape as the chart below shows we re in the safe zone when it comes to government debt at around 60 per cent of gdp compared with say japan which is pushing towards 250 per cent we come in around 22nd on the debt standings australia is in a safe zone for government debt compared to other oecd nations oecd where does that debt come from it comes from running up deficits from spending more than you raise in tax while there s a school of thought that you can continually rack up deficits without worrying about it most conventional economists reckon governments should aim to have a balanced budget in the medium to long term the idea is that you should squirrel away reserves in good times so you can overspend when times get tough that s where things get tricky for the government when tony abbott was elected prime minister in 2013 he and then treasurer joe hockey were sounding the alarm bells on our national debt which had blown out after the global financial crisis they continually talked of a debt crisis when there wasn t one and the debt and deficit disaster to fix it mr hockey promised a surplus in the coalition s first year in office and one every year after despite the pledge our budget has been in deficit each year since then which means we have seen a steady increase in gross debt as the graph below indicates it also shows the percentage of foreign investors in our government debt australia s gross debt has been steadily increasing despite a pledge by former treasurers to achieve surpluses australian bureau of statistics and aofm accounting 101 why the deficit has persisted we rode through the worst of the global financial crisis partly thanks to government spending but also because china ramped up investment in infrastructure which fuelled an incredible demand for our resources while we are now beginning to close the gap we haven t been able to get back into surplus and a big reason is that we ve had a structural deficit in the decade leading up to the gfc as chinese demand for our resources saw cash flood the economy we restructured our tax system with a series of income tax cuts we made permanent changes to the tax laws on the basis of a temporary boom a couple of other factors weighed on our finances as well before the 2013 election mr abbott promised to abolish the mining tax and the carbon tax he kept his word and now both are gone but you don t need to be a bean counter to figure out that cutting off revenue streams isn t good for balancing the books the mining tax was on the cusp of delivering decent returns for treasury because the massive investment write offs in new mines and equipment were winding down the carbon tax was even more problematic because the abbott government replaced the tax with a giant subsidy it replaced income with an expense as one senior liberal at the time explained to your columnist julia was taking money from polluters and giving it to taxpayers tony is taking money from taxpayers and giving it to polluters in 2014 the federal government committed 2 55 billion to its emissions reduction fund last year it committed another 2 billion via the climate solutions fund a large portion of that money has been doled out to recipients for tree planting or to maintain existing trees we still don t know how many of those trees were incinerated in the recent fires that tore through vast areas of rural australia rather than soaking up carbon our trees have been pouring it back into the atmosphere and now the business community including major miners like bhp are pushing for the reintroduction of a carbon price as a means of meeting our emissions targets which many in the coalition openly oppose a slowing economy meets an external crisis the biggest headache for mr morrison right now is the state of the economy if the bushfires that gathered global attention and sent government approval ratings plummeting weren t bad enough a virus sweeping through our biggest trading partner threatens to curb global growth the bushfires will have an adverse affect on australia s economy aap dean lewins most of that pain will be felt here add to the equation that australian households hold the world record when it comes to debt thanks to some of the globe s most expensive real estate and then last week the news no one wanted to hear headline unemployment jumped to 5 3 per cent kilometres away from the 4 5 per cent the reserve bank has targeted but it s not just the unemployed there s also the underemployed add them together and almost 14 per cent of the workforce either is out of work or not working enough to get by not enough work means not enough pay australian s unemployment and underemployment levels have been trending upwards the last five years abs morgan stanley research that s the reason wages growth has been abysmal for five years and once again it is tapering off australians aren t simply unwilling to spend they re hocked to the eyeballs with little spare cash and minimal pay rises the crisis ricocheting through china hard on the heels of the bushfires is likely to tip our economy into the red in the march quarter that should spell the end for any chance of a budget surplus
while welcoming news that china had reported a drop in new deaths and cases on saturday the world health organisation who nonetheless cautioned against hasty predictions about the epidemic expressing concerns about the number of new infections in other countries speaking at the meeting japan s finance minister taro aso told reporters he had warned the g20 that the world economy would suffer a serious impact in case of a dire scenario where the virus spreads further but it s hard to grasp what is happening as there s relatively little information i can say today s participants called for the need to coordinate in responding to the virus impact said taro aso amidst the general call for a coordinated response to the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy reuters cited a source as saying the g20 countries had not yet scheduled any separate committee or meetings to deal with the matter investors embrace safe haven greenback amidst concerns over the global coronavirus outbreak the us dollar index reached a three year high the ice us dollar index finished the week at its highest level since april 2017 investors have been seeking to put money into perceived safer bets such as the dollar gold and us treasury bonds buoyed by expectations that the epidemic s impact will be lesser felt in the united states there is a cocktail of factors supporting the dollar at the moment cnn quoted win thin global head of currency strategy at brown brothers harriman as saying the dollar has been rallying amidst forecasts by the atlanta federal reserve s gdpnow model that us growth will accelerate to 2 6 per cent in the first quarter as the dollar surged across the board on an upbeat economy and coronavirus concerns the euro plunged to its lowest level against the dollar in 34 months
riyadh saudi arabia the united states under pressure from european countries to address the economic threat of climate change agreed on sunday to include a reference to those risks in a joint statement at the conclusion of a meeting of the world s top economic leaders the inclusion of the term climate change in a statement from the group of 20 finance ministers appeared to be a notable but subtle acknowledgment by the united states that the threat from rising temperatures was a valid economic concern the reference on the third page of the document and at the bottom of a long list of potential risks said the financial stability implications of climate change were being monitored by the g20 s financial stability board the trump administration does not accept the established science that human activities are the dominant cause of climate change it has aggressively rolled back environmental regulations including those aimed at curbing greenhouse gases over the last three years president trump s position that these regulations hold back business have left the united states at odds with other countries at international forums regularly threatening to derail official statements or communiqués but rising temperatures and increasingly frequent and severe weather events have stoked concerns that climate change poses a significant risk to the world economy and the global financial system bruno le maire the french finance minister said in an interview on sunday he and treasury secretary steven mnuchin had a long discussion on saturday evening about the language while mr le maire had hoped for something more extensive he said he believed that progress was made
in 2010 in the wake of the global banking crisis 34 of the world s richest nations those that belong to the organisation for economic cooperation development oecd ramped up their borrowing to 10 9 trillion in 2019 the oecd revealed last week those same governments took their borrowing to a fresh high of 11 4tn the paris based thinktank says the new figure is a cause for worry especially when those same governments have only managed to grow their national economies at a snail s pace over the past 10 years without strong growth debts become a bigger burden on government finances when things turn nasty as they did 10 years ago the ratings agency s p took a broader view of government debt last week wrapping together the debts of all nations to arrive at a figure of 53tn this year it expects governments to ask international investors for 8 1tn which is 20 more than they wanted in 2015 and those fears don t stop at government debt the oecd has spent the past couple of years warning about the colossal sums that corporations have borrowed in a separate assessment last week it said non financial businesses that is those outside the banking and insurance sector issued 2 1tn in bonds this is borrowing in addition to the overdraft facilities and bank loans these companies use to fund their activities greece once the pariah of the bond markets and forced to borrow at 40 can now borrow at 1 less than the us government the oecd said adding the record borrowing during 2019 to the unprecedented buildup of corporate bond debt since 2008 means that the global outstanding stock of non financial corporate bonds at the end of 2019 reached an all time high of 13 5tn many of the companies borrowing funds on the international markets don t need the cash they have enough to invest in new equipment or processes not that they do enough of that and they generate enough cash to cover all their day to day expenditure instead they are borrowing to pay ever higher dividends to their shareholders voracious investors whether they are pension funds big investment houses or sovereign wealth funds want their dividends whether the companies they have put their money into make a bigger profit from year to year or not disturbingly the word from the oecd is that today s stock of outstanding corporate bonds is closer to junk status than in any previous credit cycle jamie dimon the boss of america s largest bank jp morgan chase was asked at the world economic forum in davos whether the level of corporate borrowing was a problem and he said it held no fears for him but government debt that was another matter dimon of course makes a good profit from arranging corporate borrowing and would be unlikely to bite the hand that feeds him however he rightly points out that governments are heading for trouble should inflation ever take off again and central banks jack up interest rates lending to governments these days is mostly done by central banks especially in europe and japan the european central bank snaps up almost every bond that eurozone countries issue so much so that greece once the pariah of the bond markets and forced to borrow at 40 can now borrow at 1 less than the us government this makes borrowing an enticing answer to almost any problem that presents itself that will be the case in a couple of weeks when rishi sunak stands up and says britain needs a higher dose to satisfy its debt addiction at least he is likely to spend the funds on investment but when the uk stands on s p s list as the third largest debtor after the us and japan and ahead of italy sunak would be wise not to be reckless british steel needs a favour from france british steel is walking a tightrope and a decision by the french government expected within days could tip the balance the chinese industrial giant jingye has agreed in principle to rescue british steel paying 50m and promising to invest 1 2bn a deal would dispel the black cloud hanging over 4 000 jobs and the scunthorpe blast furnace at risk since the company collapsed into insolvency last may but there is a sticking point british steel s hayange plant in northern france which supplies the country s vast rail network during conversations with former chancellor sajid javid his french counterpart bruno le maire indicated paris was not willing to let such an asset fall into chinese hands should le maire say non to the sale of hayange to jingye it is unclear why the chinese firm would proceed with the deal while scunthorpe captures the imagination in the uk hayange may well be the jewel in the company s crown unlike the business as a whole it is thought to be profitable it makes a wider variety of rail track than scunthorpe which gives it access to more markets around the world the steel for the crossrail project was manufactured in the uk but had to be rolled at hayange jingye wants to boost production at the uk site by half a million tonnes a year but if it can t send that steel to hayange it will need to find external buyers for the unfinished product the brexit context is inescapable britain finds itself reliant on french goodwill just as it bids adieu to the bloc the two countries once shared should french assent not be forthcoming it will be back to the drawing board buyers such as turkey s cengiz holdings claim to be ready to pick up the ball but that means starting the dealmaking clock all over again meanwhile taxpayers continue to fund a government indemnity supporting british steel s 1m a day losses the treasury s patience will not last forever and time is running out sniping about bp muddies climate waters bp s audacious ambition to become carbon neutral has positioned the oil giant less as a climate leader than a global lightning rod for its rivals and for green campaigners its aim to become a net zero company by 2050 which will require offsetting more emissions every year than are produced by the whole of the uk emerged without a detailed plan or roadmap of interim targets on the way to an admittedly distant goal which lies almost a generation away the lack of detail has not gone unnoticed by either environmental groups or bp s fossil fuel peers last week mark cutifani boss of mining giant anglo american launched what was viewed by most as a thinly veiled attack on bp s green plans saying there were too many people throwing stuff around with regard to climate targets and many don t understand or aren t committed to making the changes according to him it s all about what you do not what you say you re going to do quite glencore s outspoken south african chief executive ivan glasenberg called bp s climate aims wishy washy because the goals were a long way out this industry scepticism is damaging not because it muddies the debut of new bp boss bernard looney but because it devalues a vital shift in corporate strategy that all fossil fuel firms must undergo bp s ambition threatens to breed cynicism rather than inspire copycat progress royal dutch shell has made clear that it has no intention of entering an arms race of co 2 targets not least because it is focusing on its own interim emissions targets targets bp has yet to set shell is at least setting out a path towards emissions reductions but critical words between fossil fuel producers must not detract from the desperate need for action
as fear has crept its way into global markets investors around the world are seeking the comfort of safe haven assets such as the u s dollar and gold staying true to what ray dalio trades portfolio predicted in last july gold has soared more than 8 so far in 2020 once again proving of its ability to deliver stellar returns during turbulent times in capital markets the greenback is living up to expectations as well on feb 19 the u s dollar index reached a high of 99 577 which is the highest level recorded since may of 2017 source bloomberg ubs head of asset allocation for the americas jason draho told the wall street journal last week the most plausible explanation for ongoing dollar strength is that investors globally want to own u s assets because they have the highest confidence in the u s economy doing fine which is more of a flight to conviction not safety the impacts of a rising dollar will be felt across business sectors on a global scale so understanding the implications of this development is essential to making the necessary changes to investors portfolios to secure sustainable returns the relationship between the dollar and corporate earnings when american companies deliver stellar financial performance and beat analyst estimates stock prices tend to follow suit a dent in profits on the other hand could lead to a severe downturn in capital markets and the financial crisis of 2008 is a classic example of such a phenomenon when the dollar strengthens against other major currencies american products become expensive in global markets this might lead to a decline in exports which is a negative development for the economic growth of the country the u s government has unveiled its plan to make the country s products more competitive in global markets and president trump on several occassions in 2019 blamed the soaring dollar for not helping the cause if the currency strengthens any further in the near future companies that depend on international markets might issue revenue warnings for consumers however this could turn out to be good news as imports become cheaper a headwind for oil prices the covid 19 virus is proving to be a threat to oil prices but troubles don t seem to end there for the industry historical evidence suggests that a strengthening dollar will be bad news for energy prices according to economic theories there are two reasons for this commodity prices are quoted in u s dollars therefore a rise in the currency means that it would take fewer units to buy a barrel of oil all else equal the u s has been a net importer of crude oil throughout history therefore a rise in oil prices would lead to a larger trade balance deficit as more greenbacks would be sent abroad source federal reserve the inverse relationship however has become less strong in the recent past as the united states now is a net exporter of oil as a result of increased drilling activities as of 2018 the u s topped the list of largest oil producing countries in the world source u s energy information administration even though this is relieving news for energy investors the negative correlation between the two variables has not entirely diminished therefore as the dollar continues to gain traction against other currencies oil prices can be expected to take a hit a slowdown in global economic growth driven by the spread of the coronavirus will add salt to the wound as it would reduce the demand for the commodity there s no need to panic though as peter lynch explained in december the long term outlook for energy prices is promising therefore contrarian investors should look for attractive opportunities in today s markets in a bid to capitalize on future price gains not good news for emerging markets either there s a lot to like about developing countries the expected economic growth in these regions is considerably higher than that of north american countries and europe equity market valuations are relatively cheap and these stocks provide much needed diversification benefits to american investors however the strengthening dollar is not a welcome sign for the performance of emerging market equities according to data from blackrock blk financial this is the asset class with the highest negative correlation with the u s dollar source blackrock servicing debt denominated in dollars becomes a challenge for these nations as more units in the local currencies would be required to buy the greenback according to bis international brazil chile china india indonesia and korea are at the highest risk of a strong dollar as these countries have the largest outstanding amounts of dollar denominated bonds an investor with exposure to emerging market stocks should ideally take measures to diversify within the asset class to minimize the risk of high concentration in any one of these economies it s time for small companies to shine as highlighted in an article published in december large u s companies have outperformed their smaller peers over the last half a decade by a healthy margin but there are a few developments that point to the opposite happening in the next several years a strong dollar would be a nice compliment as well unlike multinational organizations companies with limited access to capital and other resources primarily sell their products and services to american consumers however many of these companies might depend on raw material imports from china brazil hong kong and other asian countries a strengthening dollar makes imports cheaper presenting an opportunity to expand profit margins even though this is applicable for large companies as well the caveat is that a high percentage of their sales come from outside the u s thereby offsetting the benefits of low raw material costs investors can either use an exchange traded fund or invest prudently in a basket of small cap stocks to benefit from a higher dollar takeaway macroeconomic factors can and will have lasting impacts on capital markets the strengthening u s dollar is one such development that has the potential to disrupt the market performance and tilt the odds in favor of some companies and industries while making survival difficult for others at the current level however the dollar will likely not trouble the markets the real risk is the possibility of an additional increase liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab scwh told marketwatch a stronger u s currency eventually could present a headwind to stocks but it would likely take a further run up in any case preparing for the worst is the best action investors can take today rather than waiting for the risk to materialize building a diversified portfolio with equity securities of many international markets investing in small cap stocks and de risking by taking profits off overvalued companies are some of the actions that investors might want to consider to secure sustainable long

illustration luo xuan gt under the daunting impact of the novel coronavirus assault china s economic activity has taken a hit now as the country scrambles to restart its economic engine a premium economic sector calls for extraordinary attention from the country s top decision makers the country s 4 000 odd banks last year the us government s tariffs gambit and china s subsequent trade retaliations caused the economy to wobble at the lowest growth rate in three decades at just over 6 percent that stress was transmitted to the country s financial system as a number of companies failed to pay back loans and as a result smaller banks creaked under mounting bad debts to prevent the risks from snowballing the people s bank of china the country s central bank rushed to restructure the troubled local lenders including baoshang bank bank of jinzhou hengfeng bank and harbin bank strategic investors were introduced to the four lenders and new capital was replenished the bail out of the four lenders in the severe financial strait was significant because it nipped the risk in its infancy and prevented it from spreading and hamstringing the holistic system currently the coronavirus disease is still savaging wuhan city and hubei province while shadowing other chinese regions the double whammy of the virus attack and america s trade war will batter china s economy which faces a formidable job to deliver an annualized growth rate higher than 5 8 percent in 2020 this year is undisputedly the most difficult year for china in the past 30 years but if the country s banking system is carefully managed and successfully weathers this ferocious hailstorm the world s second largest economy is likely to regain its momentum in the second half of the year the country should be all out to prevent any systematic financial risk from forming and gaining tract the banks must not fall and succumb to the deadly virus in 2019 the people s bank of china conducted a stress test among 30 selected medium and large sized lenders in the scenario of gdp growth of only 5 3 percent seven banks were found to fail the test and the central bank s 2019 china financial stability report published in late november said 13 percent of a total of 4 379 lenders in the country including hundreds of rural cooperative banks face a high risk of capital inadequacy the stress test and the central bank report somber as they are should sound the alarm bell for the policy makers and those small and medium sized banks are more volatile to current uncertainties china s banking regulators should not take a chance on february 20 the central bank moved to cut the benchmark loan prime rate lpr by 10 basis points for a one year loan and five basis points for five year loans in an attempt to reduce borrowing costs of millions of chinese enterprises and businesses the rate cut is a double edged sword helping economic entities but trimming profit margins off the banks which earn at a distance from depositing and loaning rates throughout 2020 china should maintain a relatively loose monetary policy so that all the lenders could have access to adequate funds from the interbank lending market to back up their daily operations tight market liquidity should be avoided and the central bank together with china s banking and insurance regulatory commission should implement stress tests on selected lenders at regular intervals to ferret out all types of operational hazards of the lenders and resolve them promptly the country s top five too big to fall state owned mega banks including icbc china construction bank agricultural bank of china bank of china and bank of communications own much stronger fundamentals and are unlikely to cave in to any stress caused by a slowing economy but smaller banks with limited resources will face the brunt of pressure from the economic slowdown chinese regulators need to place proportionately larger supervisory manpower on them because those lenders will carry a great spillover risk the author is an editor with the global times bizopinion globaltimes com cn

malta has literally paved its own way in the world to no longer serve as a resort for english learners one of the smallest countries in the eu and having no natural resources malta is really good at understanding its strengths over the years it has been ready to listen seize opportunities and run with them for a simple reason it is its tiny size that enables malta to implement any idea in the short time period call it adventurous but this country was the first to introduce the regulation of online gambling which now accounts for 12 of its gross national product home to 500 online casinos malta issues licenses to websites putting them on the uk gambling commission s whitelist under the terms of competitive licensing fees and appealing tax rates it is not unthinkable that gambling industry developers from the malta remote gaming council did the groundwork for crypto deciding to broaden the range of service let s see how in just one year a virtually unknown country became the blockchain island spoken about by forbes cryptocurrency regulation in malta in 2018 malta s ex prime minister joseph muscat attracted public attention at the 73rd united nations general assembly unga in new york city saying malta is the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate cryptocurrency it s hard to imagine a thing like that being announced at an annual event where world leaders speak of global warming pollution and world peace crypto taking over fiat was announced by a top public official not just some crypto enthusiast shilling a doubtful coin or fraudulent ico and this ladies and gentlemen is the dawn of a new financial age the malta financial services authority maltese open tax regime and an open door policy towards crypto gives malta the name of a disruptive government the best building in malta which is also known as the house of the maltese government is now home to the most promising crypto and blockchain based pieces of legislation the malta financial services authority mfsa is the single regulator of financial services in malta the mfsa performs functions of the central bank of malta the malta stock exchange and the malta financial services centre it regulates all kinds of finance from banking to insurance companies from investment services to securities markets since 2018 the malta financial services authority has also been responsible for regulating virtual financial assets so if you are interested in the current regulation of initial coin offerings virtual currencies or anti money laundering provisions check out this document moreover you can follow mfsa twitter to keep up to date on news like organizing a workshop on financial crime risk mitigation or publishing consultation feedback regarding the establishment of a new regulatory framework for fintechs maltese blockchain bills on november 1st 2018 malta launched 3 blockchain bills the malta digital innovation authority bill the technology arrangements and services bill and the virtual financial assets bill according to the digital innovation authority bill the maltese government ensures credibility and guarantees legal assurances regarding cryptocurrencies the technology arrangements and services bill provides a framework for registration it will be easier for crypto companies and exchanges to start their business the virtual financial assets bill conducts solid regulatory work for cryptocurrencies icos crypto wallet developers exchanges asset managers and more it is probably the most important one as it was created to regulate initial coin offerings icos domestic and international cryptocurrency exchanges after carefully examining whitepapers the vfa bill provides procedures and requirements for icos according to which some icos would have to disclose their financial history this step will really sort the wheat from the chaff and encourage genuinely meaningful blockchain projects besides under the new act wannabe financial service practitioners have to pass a test after serious training nearly two thirds of those applying for cryptocurrency agent certification failed the official assessment process despite last second changes intended to boost the pass rate the times of malta reported on january 30 initiating public discourse on crypto right after the three bills passed legislation malta blockchain summit took place it made a reality of the prime minister s plans for malta to become a global trail blazer in the dlt industry and validated the legal developments for the crypto community malta blockchain summit malta ai and blockchain summit is a regular event series that brings together thousands of technical minds and enthusiasts to make helpful connections and explore new technologies the first summit took place in november 2018 with the fourth show coming in june 2020 the organizers set it as their goal to ensure quality content at the summit whose agenda focuses on presentations by crypto and tech influencers and discussion of practices in the blockchain and ai industries the show attracts an extensive number of presenters and sponsors among its previous participants were malta s ex prime minister joseph muscat the winklevoss twins the parliamentary secretary silvio schembri and many other thought leaders the expo floor brought together a large number of exciting projects from tree coin s ecological initiative to cryptotag s titanium recovery seed and vr flying simulators mbs was also a place for those who decided to have a public debut like freewallet after speaking out the company has strengthened its credibility in the eyes of crypto society have the maltese changed their perception of crypto malta is one of the smallest countries in the world with a population estimated at 475 701 a few bitcoin atms are located on this island and there is room to grow according to statistics from april 2018 malta was the 1 country in trading volume despite being only the 24th regarding the number of cryptocurrency exchanges after the government passed the aforementioned pieces of crypto legislation malta became a lucrative destination for crypto exchange headquarters like okex but do the common citizens of malta use crypto not much you ll be surprised that the results of the poll taken by cointelegraph reveal that in 2018 not a single student at the university of malta had a clue about the blockchain island nevertheless by 2019 the media changed public discourse we can only suggest that malta s way to crypto dominance will inevitably incentivize its technology driven population to use crypto in their everyday life considering the incredible choice of crypto platforms hosted in malta crypto operations and trading won t be a hard task for the locals since brands of exchange platforms are omnipresent the choice for malta s citizens seems to be easily made unlike many other countries malta is known for its zero bitcoin taxation this is an encouraging point for handling payments in bitcoins crypto businesses and mining the welcoming attitude of the maltese authorities towards blockchain and crypto businesses attracted top global exchanges and crypto entrepreneurs with a clear legal framework and supportive infrastructure it took a very short time to turn malta into a global blockchain hub malta based exchange platforms include such brands as okex bitbay coindeal aax cryptocurrency enterprises in malta currently there are 20 entities registered under malta s virtual financial assets vfa act and many more companies are applying for local licenses by the msfa a couple of words about growing crypto and blockchain businesses operating in malta ico launch malta have you ever heard of security token offering sto platforms now you have ico launch malta has raised over 1 1 b which means it s well worth mentioning here the company provides technical services associated with launching icos and security token offerings by partnering with mfsa licensed corporate service providers exante this next generation investment company is also based in malta a full eurozone member with an advantageous blockchain specific regulatory regime exante offers the opportunity to get first hand trading experience using their web trading program that enables the user to access 50 of the world s financial markets ledger projects a team of technologists industry experts and academics use dlt to execute transactions and agreements their lp 01 project is a property transfer management application that facilitates notarial work it provides access to real time information on sales of properties in a country stasis stasis provides custodial services third party audits and deals with secure smart contracts combining the vast potential of the cryptocurrency market with the stability and reliability of traditional currencies mining industry in malta according to media reports the outburst of cryptomining amid the crypto rush of 2017 was also the case for malta as the country lacks natural resources it can t rely on coal based power that is primarily used by most mining facilities like those located in china currently there are no sticking points or restrictions on mining in malta except for the fact that mining was way easier and cheaper several years ago for instance take the recent 2 000 lawsuit against a retailer of a bitcoin mining machine ironically the afflicted maltese miner made less money on bitcoins than he spent on the electricity required to mine them in fact according to the estimates of digiconomist up to 80 of bitcoin mining revenue pays off electricity bills physical mining has given way to cloud mining the technology of the future genesis mining the world s largest bitcoin mining company registered in malta keeps a great deal of their hardware in iceland to cut cooling costs they also save on electricity and good internet connection the essence of the technology is that registered users can mine via the provider s cloud without having to buy specialised expensive equipment the prospects of cryptocurrency in malta the plans to turn malta into the forefront of the blockchain industry have been implemented to a remarkable extent local authorities put fair efforts in to prepare a supportive framework and the results were not long coming malta based exchanges alone produce a notable share of trading volume should the same pace remain for the local crypto market we may expect more exchanges and crypto businessmen to contribute to the island s prosperity however malta s way to leading positions in crypto has not been without hindrances it was reported that access to bank accounts for crypto businesses is still a point of vulnerability some industry leaders like genesis mining seemed to have waived their former plans on moving headquarters to malta it makes observers believe that more structural improvements need to come education in the sphere of blockchain and distributed ledger technology is an essential first step to strengthening the industry from within understanding that maltese government issued 300 000 in grants to fund different scholarships and the university of malta introduced a dlt master s degree currently malta is one of the soundest blockchain centers in the world and has everything to thrive as the industry s trendsetter featured image by

france is ready to support lebanon financially bilaterally or multilaterally its finance minister said on sunday warning against mixing economic recovery in the country with us led efforts to counter iran in the region france always stands ready to help lebanon it has always been the case in the past and it will be the case in the future bruno le maire told reuters in an interview at the end of a meeting of finance officials from the group of 20 g20 major economies in the saudi capital riyadh if there is any help required from lebanon france will be there lebanon s long brewing economic crisis spiralled last year as the country s capital inflows slowed and protests erupted against the ruling elite since protests erupted in october lebanon s currency has slumped by roughly 60 percent on a parallel market dollars have become scarce prices have spiked and thousands of jobs have been shed stay informed with mee s newsletters sign up to get the latest alerts insights and analysis starting with turkey unpacked as crisis bites lebanon to seek imf technical assistance on debt restructuring read more as the crisis deepens hitting ordinary lebanese hard there has been little sign of foreign aid western and sunni led gulf arab states that helped in the past have made clear that any support hinges on beirut implementing long delayed reforms to address root causes such as state corruption and bad governance saudi arabia s finance minister said on sunday the kingdom was in contact with allies and international bodies to coordinate any support for lebanon on the basis of economic reforms proposed by beirut an international monetary fund imf team has discussed possible options in recent meetings with lebanese officials who are seeking technical advice for tackling the crisis as beirut mulls a plan for dealing with fast approaching debt payments lebanon has a 1 2bn eurobond maturing on 9 march and is apparently seeking advice on whether to pay it mee has reported lebanese politicians are divided over repaying about 6bn of eurobond principal and coupon payments that will come due this year bloomberg reported earlier some think the government should engage with bondholders to restructure its debt and save what s left of its reserves to support imports of essential goods others argue that the country should pay in full and preserve its reputation in the international market lebanon has never defaulted on its debt le maire said decisions by lebanon s government were urgently needed to improve the situation on the ground we want to move in the official fora and we think that the imf might have a role to play at one stage but it s up to the lebanese government to decide he said but if there is any need for help either bilateral or multilateral we stand ready to help lebanese prime minister hassan diab s government took office last month with the backing of hezbollah the iran backed shia group and its allies as washington presses its policy of maximum pressure against iran with wide ranging sanctions we know that there are ties between the two issues but we don t want to mix the issue of economic recovery in lebanon which is today the clear emergency and the question of iran le maire added
by ben mccarthy on june 22 2019 a 24 year old named jada louis died due to complications from diabetes louis had been skipping her insulin because the medication had become so expensive she could not afford to both pay for it and pay her rent sadly louis story is a tragedy all too ubiquitous in the united states the only country in the developed world that does not guarantee its citizens some type of universal healthcare healthcare in the us is beholden to a private insurance industry which makes billions of dollars in profit every year 56 6 billion in 2018 alone from sick and dying americans while millions of others go uninsured any american who has ever had to see a doctor knows how painful navigating the us healthcare system can be and it s not as though the complications result in better results the united states spends more than 10 200 per capita on healthcare while switzerland the closest comparison spends 8 000 the comparable country average is 5 280 while the us spends double the comparable country average and more than any other developed country we rank 34th in life expectancy at birth and have the highest rates of infant mortality low birth weight children and maternal mortality of any country in the developed world all of this points to an over bloated and highly inequitable system that costs us trillions but does not improve the health of the vast majority of americans when confronted with the statistics it becomes hard to defend a system that costs more and produces less than any other comparable country medicare for all would drastically improve the average american s health by guaranteeing health insurance while also cutting wasteful healthcare spending and mitigating the profiteering of the insurance industry the first step to creating a more equitable health system in the united states is guaranteeing every american care medicare for all would do just that the primary arguments against universal healthcare in the united states are economic in nature that it would simply cost too much or that it would substantially raise taxes on middle class americans yet study after study has shown that medicare for all would save trillions of dollars while also saving poor and middle class americans substantial amounts every year unlike current private insurance premiums which are the same regardless of income a medicare tax would be progressive individuals would pay based on ability as emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman economists at uc berkeley note medicare for all would actually reduce taxes for most americans instead of forcing all employees at a company to pay the same premium regardless of income a medicare tax would have the janitor paying one rate and the executive paying another effectively saving lower and middle class americans thousands every year and resulting in the largest take home pay raise in a generation the real barrier to medicare for all in the us is not low public opinion rather it s opposition from insurance and pharmaceutical industries and politicians beholden to industry interests recent polls show that over 70 of americans are in favor of medicare for all in the richest country in the history of the world plenty of money exists to pay for universal healthcare there was no discussion of financial infeasibility when 17 trillion of taxpayer money was spent bailing out wall street firms that plunged the us into economic recession and cost middle class and poor americans their homes and savings there was no talk of financial infeasibility when republicans slashed tax rates for billionaires and multinational corporations projected to cost over 2 trillion to argue that medicare for all is economically infeasible while 41 of working age americans are paying off some type of medical debt 45 000 americans die annually due to lack of healthcare and another 30 million are uninsured is not only nonsensical but morally bankrupt as harvard physician adam gaffney writes the real stumbling block is not that single payer advocates arithmetic is poor it s that american politics are dominated by the rich indeed it is in no small part due to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries lobbying that the health system we have is as broken as it is in 2018 over 567 million was spent on health lobbying and every attempt at healthcare reform has been dominated by money and special interest groups studies have indicated that universal coverage improves health across the board and that access to universal coverage is positively correlated with life expectancy providing healthcare to all americans would be a straightforward way to drastically improve this country s health while also addressing equity it is time that we do away with for profit healthcare and transition to a system that makes healthcare a human right guaranteed to every person in the united states ben mccarthy is currently getting his masters in public health at the mailman school of public health at columbia university
the economic outlook for 2020 is far from clear especially with deepening concerns on the effect of the coronavirus which may affect global growth and dampen the earnings of companies the european commission described the outbreak and spread of the coronavirus and its economic impact as a key downside risk however the interpretation on the effects of such a virus has been totally different for the majority of global markets in fact us and european markets continued to rally and reach all time highs in my opinion investors and markets have downplayed the consequences of the coronavirus particularly for those companies dependent on stock supplies from china the closure of factories in china could lead to disruptions in the supply chain model for worldwide companies leaving them with no other option but to find new counterparties at possible higher costs additionally companies that have revenue segmentation in china may be hit by lower demand at the same time elevated trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on global growth prospects should investors have discounted a higher risk premium towards risky assets when the news broke out it comes to no surprise that apple warned last monday that it was unlikely to meet its march quarter sales guidance if other major companies communicate the same sort of message then global risk sentiment increases therefore a portfolio that is selective in asset allocation and has an element of underlying that provides insurance remains key since the virus outbreak we have seen a clear disparity in equity market returns as the western region progressed while the asian latam latin american emerging and gcc gulf cooperation council regions all fell one of the few european equity markets that declined was in fact the obx index norwegian equity market at face value one may be wary and this should instigate an alarming bell on the outlook of norwegian assets however in my view this does not mean that one should look at the norwegian market as a finished article it is no surprise that with the coronavirus one sector that got hit is the energy sector since china is a net importer of oil with the obx index composite holding around 25 per cent in the energy sector the index fell on a year to date basis while several commentators believe that oil prices should remain weak for at least the first half of the year one may argue that on a risk adjusted basis the norwegian model may still offer value over some of its european peers as a start the economic conditions in norway remain healthy despite the uncertainty on the country s main revenue source oil the transition effects of having the norwegian oil industry cut direct emissions from operations in the nordic country by 40 per cent by 2030 and make them almost carbon neutral by 2050 as pressure on climate change intensifies remains to be seen however as also reported in the economist there has been a discovery of johan sverdrup a giant new oilfield in the north sea whereby production could earn norway an estimated 100bn over the next 50 years on another note the country had already been taking measures to diversify away from its main source of revenue and that was through the creation of the 1 2 trillion sovereign wealth fund the world s biggest which was set up in 1996 until then oil revenues had been spent as they were earned the government pension fund global and the fiscal rule have since 2001 set out the plan for the phasing in of petroleum income and investment returns to the norwegian economy interestingly the financial times reported how the wealth fund held a record amount of equities at the end of june with 69 3 per cent of its assets held in equities up from 66 per cent at the end of 2018 so far the fund has been a success story even on the adaptation of when to increase exposure into risky assets from 40 per cent to 50 per cent during or after the 2008 09 financial crises the fund which on average owns 1 4 per cent of every listed company worldwide created a wealth effect when one analyses the equity composition from the report of norges bank in 2018 close to 70 per cent of the norges bank fund underlying is dependent on two countries the us 41 per cent followed by the uk 27 5 per cent the third largest exposure is coming from japan while france has the highest exposure from the eu region the fund has the least exposure towards the middle east when looking at the exposure it holds in the us the top four equities held are all in the tech sector being microsoft apple alphabet and

have blocked half of the united nations aid delivery programs in the war torn country a strong arm tactic to force the agency to give them greater control over the massive humanitarian campaign along with a cut of billions of dollars in foreign assistance according to aid officials and internal documents obtained by the associated press ap yemen s houthi rebels have blocked half of the united nations aid delivery programs in the war torn country a strong arm tactic to force the agency to give them greater control over the massive humanitarian campaign along with a cut of billions of dollars in foreign assistance according to aid officials and internal documents obtained by the associated press the rebel group has made granting access to areas under their control contingent on a fl urry of conditions that aid agencies reject in part because it would give the houthis greater sway over who receives aid documents and interviews show the houthis obstruction has hindered several programs that feed the near starving population and help those displaced by the nearly 6 year civil war a senior un official said speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation over 2 million beneficiaries are directly affected the official said the houthis have been pushing back against un efforts to tighten monitoring of some 370 million a year that its agencies already give to government institutions controlled mostly by the rebel group documents show that money is supposed to pay salaries and other administration costs but more than a third of the money spent last year wasn t audited according to an internal document leaked to the ap the un has largely kept quiet in public about the pressure but behind the scenes the agency and international donors are digging in against the houthi demands the ap spoke to seven workers and officials from un and independent agencies about the situation all spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals the ap also saw dozens of documents including emails of aid officials in october the un humanitarian coordinator for yemen lise grande sent a letter to the houthi appointed prime minister complaining about a long list of demands the overwhelming majority of them impede or delay delivery of aid and many violate humanitarian principles she said in the letter a copy of which was obtained by the ap for months the houthis demanded a 2 percent cut from the entire aid budget be given to them a condition the un and donors rejected in an email to the ap a spokesperson for the us agency for international development said houthi attempts to implement a tax on humanitarian assistance are unacceptable and directly contradict international humanitarian principles the united states donated 686 million to yemen in 2019 according to usaid last week the houthis appeared to back off the 2 percent demand but continue to press for other concessions according to aid officials during a meeting in brussels last thursday aid agencies and international donors threatened to reduce aid if houthis continue to impose restrictions on un operations in yemen the situation has reached a breaking point they said in a statement at least one agency the world food program is currently considering cutting back the monthly food aid it delivers to 12 million yemenis every other month a un official said it s unfortunate that people will suffer but this is on the houthis the official said they can t use people as hostages for too long the houthis demands have stoked longtime concerns among aid agencies over the rebels diverting of humanitarian funds and supplies into their own or their supporters pockets or toward their war effort delivering aid in a war zone has always posed a problem for un agencies but officials said the situation in yemen has been especially challenging the houthis have withheld visas and permissions for equipment and supplies and refused to grant clearances for un missions to move through rebel controlled areas aid workers said agency leaders past willingness to concede to some of the rebels demands has emboldened the houthi leaders to push for more nearly 300 000 pregnant and nursing mothers and children under age 5 haven t received nutrition supplements for more than six months because the houthis held beneficiaries hostage to the 2 percent demand another un official said in another example houthi authorities for months delayed permission to distribute 2 000 tons of food enough to feed 160 000 people in the district of aslam where the ap previously found starving villagers reduced to eating boiled leaves when approval came in november the food had spoiled beyond the point of salvage another aid official said houthi leaders have remained defiant in the face of un pushback yemen will survive if agencies suspend aid abdul mohsen tawoos secretary general of the houthi agency coordinating international aid told european donors during a jan 20 skype call minutes of the call were obtained by the ap he said the houthis wanted to reach an agreement with the un and its donors but won t be bullied tawoos accused grande the top un official in yemen of sending false reports about houthis restricting the movement of un humanitarian operations houthi leaders have threatened to expel her from the country the un s massive aid program totaling 8 35 billions since 2015 is vital to keeping many yemenis alive the un calls the situation in yemen the world s worst humanitarian crisis ten million people in the country are on the brink of famine and 80 percent of the population of 29 million in need of aid according to the un more than 3 million people have been displaced cholera epidemics have killed hundreds and at least 2 2 million children under 5 suffer from severe malnutrition the agency said the iranian backed houthi rebels control the capital sanaa and much of the country s north where most of the population lives and the need for aid is greatest they are at war with a us backed saudi led coalition fighting on behalf of the internationally recognized government with the economy in freefall the un aid effort is a major source of foreign currency into the country the un received around 3 billion in 2019 in international donations for its campaign short of its 4 2 billion goal the houthi demand for 2 percent of that budget would funnel 60 80 million into the coffers of their aid coordination agency the supreme council for management and coordination of humanitarian affairs and international cooperation known as scmcha qassim hussein al houthi the head of the international agencies department in the houthi presidency said the money was necessary for scmcha s operating expenses it carries heavy financial burden it s in charge of facilitating distributing security and organizing the work of the agencies he said al houthi argued that it s the un agencies that spend a much larger percentage of their budgets on administration without real oversight he said the un aid delivery programs blocked by the houthis are not a priority for the yemen people harassment intimidation and suspected embezzling of funds by houthis have been going on for years aid workers said and have gotten worse since the rebels created their aid coordination agency in early 2018 since then houthi led security agencies have arrested local workers blocked aid missions or held up supplies according to internal emails and documents seen by the ap not even a simple project can be carried out in northern yemen without the consent and supervision of this body said a yemeni chief of a local aid organization the un rarely pushed back calculating that aid had to be delivered at any cost un agencies continued to put hundreds of millions of dollars into houthi accounts for capacity building a common practice in humanitarian programs to ensure government bodies function some of the money went to salaries for doctors teachers and other vital employees who have otherwise gone without pay amid the war millions more went to the houthi aid agency for administrative costs and salaries aid workers privately expressed concerns about the funds from un aid agencies being diverted into the coffers of houthi leaders or their supporters unicef told the ap in a statement that its funds were strictly monitored and no instances of diversions were found the world health organization said all its spending was subject to internal and external audit as well as frequent internal reviews on multiple levels who also said it found no evidence that its funds have been diverted still last summer the un requested all agencies report how much they were giving in direct cash transfers in 2019 the total reached 370 million around 10 percent of the entire international aid budget for yemen according to a un spreadsheet obtained by the ap around 133 million was marked in the spreadsheet as not audited some officials in the houthi aid body scmcha appear to be receiving multiple salaries the data shows for a time three un agencies were each giving salaries to the body s president his deputy and general managers each of the officials received a total of 10 000 a month from the agencies the spreadsheet shows the un refugee agency also gave scmcha 1 million every three months for office rental and administrative costs while the un migration agency gave the office another 200 000 for furniture and fiber optics this news has been read 11026 times
tariffs while they re not a cure all serve an important dual function to bring about an increase in tax revenue at the water s edge and to protect the economy from excessive imports and thereby spur an increase in domestic production pat buchanan reminds us tariffs are the taxes that made america great by mark anderson what the big box media calls a trade war between the u s and china is in reality hard nosed but vitally necessary negotiations in which the trump administration is showing some fortitude in pursuing long overdue adjustments to begin reducing china s notoriously lopsided long term trade surplus with the u s president donald trump s key tool in this process is the application of tariffs against chinese imports over the last few months largely for the purpose of improving america s industrial sector by spurring domestic production tariffs while they re not a cure all across the board serve an important dual function to bring about an increase in tax revenue at the water s edge to help the u s balance its books and resist the urge to raise domestic taxes and to protect the economy from excessive chinese imports and thereby spur an increase in domestic production this production boost would translate into more buying power to purchase the productive output amid a gradually reduced reliance on imports but this upside to tariffs gets lost in the reports issued by a mass media cartel that puts undermining trump ahead of all else helping set the record straight the non partisan coalition for a prosperous america cpa announced may 9 that a department of commerce report showed that the monthly u s goods deficit with china fell to just 20 7 billion in march that s the smallest monthly deficit with china since march 2014 in the face of continuing pressure from multinational interests and the import lobby president trump has stayed the course on china tariffs cpa chairman dan dimicco remarked to the president s credit the tariffs are working america s manufacturers and workers are now seeing gains as manufacturing employment rises and china s hold on the u s market shrinks michael stumo ceo of the cpa added this is exactly what we were hoping to see when the president applied tariffs important industries that have been facing heavily subsidized competition from china s state owned enterprises we expect the next round of tariffs to have a positive effect to improve the u s economy and address beijing s continuing economic aggression cpa chief economist jeff ferry having examined the new commerce department data found that the improvement in america s goods deficit with china has come largely through a reduction in imports he added while u s exports to china were 10 4 billion in march a figure 1 9 billion lower than in march 2018 total imports reached only 31 2 billion a full 7 billion less than the march total for 2018 which was the lowest monthly china import level in five years furthermore while 2018 imports from china averaged 44 9 billion a month so far in 2019 they re averaging just 35 billion and are falling each month according to the cpa the united states economy continued to thrive in april the white house announced with the unemployment rate dropping to 3 6 the lowest unemployment rate since december 1969 according to the bureau of labor statistics bls household survey april also marks the 14th consecutive month of the unemployment rate being at or below 4 the u 6 unemployment rate a broader measure of unemployment that includes those who are unemployed marginally attached to the labor force and working part time remained at 7 3 in april matching the lowest u 6 rate since december 2000 while the white house concedes that recent job gains were predominantly concentrated in professional and business services 76 000 new jobs education and health services 62 000 new jobs and leisure and hospitality 34 000 new jobs and while the construction sector added 33 000 new jobs in april and has added 669 000 jobs since the 2016 election it ll be interesting to see what happens when tariffs to limit chinese imports and produce more goods domestically sink in and have time to adjust the economic dials mark anderson is afp s roving editor email him at tariffs the taxes that made america great before globalism became the law of the land tariffs protected and enriched the american people by patrick j buchanan as his limo carried him to work at the white house monday larry kudlow could not have been pleased with the headline in the washington post kudlow contradicts trump on tariffs the story began national economic council director lawrence kudlow acknowledged sunday that american consumers end up paying for the administration s tariffs on chinese imports contradicting president trump s repeated inaccurate claim that the chinese foot the bill a free trade evangelical kudlow had conceded on fox news that consumers pay the tariffs on products made abroad that they purchase here in the u s yet that is by no means the whole story a tariff may be described as a sales or consumption tax the consumer pays but tariffs are also a discretionary and an optional tax if you choose not to purchase chinese goods and instead buy comparable goods made in other nations or the usa then you do not pay the tariff china loses the sale this is why beijing which runs 350 billion to 400 billion in annual trade surpluses at our expense is howling loudest should donald trump impose that 25 tariff on all 500 billion in chinese exports to the u s it would cripple china s economy factories seeking assured access to the u s market would flee in panic from the middle kingdom tariffs were the taxes that made america great they were the taxes relied upon by the first and greatest of our early statesmen before the coming of the globalists woodrow wilson and fdr tariffs to protect manufacturers and jobs were the republican party s path to power and prosperity in the 19th and 20th centuries before the rise of the rockefeller eastern liberal establishment and its embrace of the british bred heresy of unfettered free trade the tariff act of 1789 was enacted with the declared purpose the encouragement and protection of manufactures it was the second act passed by the first congress led by speaker james madison it was crafted by alexander hamilton and signed by president george washington after the war of 1812 president madison backed by henry clay john calhoun and ex presidents thomas jefferson and john adams enacted the tariff of 1816 to price british textiles out of competition so that americans would build the new factories and capture the booming u s market it worked tariffs financed abraham lincoln s war the tariff of 1890 bears the name of ohio rep and future president william mckinley who said that a foreign manufacturer has no right or claim to equality with our own he pays no taxes he performs no civil duties that is economic patriotism putting america and americans first the fordney mccumber tariff gave presidents warren harding and calvin coolidge the revenue to offset the slashing of wilson s income taxes igniting that most dynamic of decades the roarin 20s that the smoot hawley tariff caused the depression of the 1930s is a new deal myth in which america s schoolchildren have been indoctrinated for decades the depression began with the crash of the stock market in 1929 nine months before smoot hawley became law the real villain the federal reserve which failed to replenish that third of the money supply that had been wiped out by thousands of bank failures milton friedman taught us that a tariff is a tax but its purpose is not just to raise revenue but to make a nation economically independent of others and to bring its citizens to rely upon each other rather than foreign entities the principle involved in a tariff is the same as that used by u s colleges and universities that charge foreign students higher tuition than their american counterparts what patriot would consign the economic independence of his country to the invisible hand of adam smith in a system crafted by intellectuals whose allegiance is to an ideology not a people what great nation did free traders ever build free trade is the policy of fading and failing powers past their prime in the half century following passage of the corn laws the british showed the folly of free trade they began the second half of the 19th century with an economy twice that of the u s and ended it with an economy half of ours and equaled by a germany which had under bismarck adopted what was known as the american system of the nations that have risen to economic preeminence in recent centuries the british before 1850 the united states between 1789 and 1914 post war japan china in recent decades how many did so through free trade none all practiced economic nationalism the problem for president donald trump once a nation is hooked on the cheap goods that are the narcotic free trade provides it is rarely able to break free the loss of its economic independence is followed by the loss of its political independence the loss of its greatness and ultimately the loss of its national identity brexit was the strangled cry of a british people that had lost its independence and desperately wanted it back

cnn president donald trump s federal reserve nominee judy shelton said in 2011 that the central bank was almost a rogue agency in the us government and had become a behemoth that couldn t be trusted with oversight of the dollar our government is promising so much to so many and at the same time we let the government control the value of our money and all of that would really go against the grain with our founders who did not see it as the government s task to supply everything to everybody she said they saw the government s task to be to protect private property and that s why they wanted limited government because they knew she added it s just the nature of having power that causes people in power to abuse the privilege i think we re now at a point where we have to ask if we can even trust government to regulate the value of our money shelton a gold standard enthusiast made the comments in a 2011 interview with the the atlas network which increases global prosperity by strengthening a network of independent partner organizations that promote individual freedom and are committed to identifying and removing barriers to human flourishing cnn reported last week that shelton is facing an uphill battle to win senate confirmation after three republicans said they were undecided on whether they will support her nomination republicans have one more seat than democrats on the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee if any republican senator votes against her nomination it would result in a tie that would likely end her nomination shelton s nomination came after two trump picks stephen moore and herman cain withdrew from consideration amid controversy before being formally nominated she has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah and was a fellow for many years at stanford s hoover institution trump appointed her to be united states executive director of the european bank for reconstruction and development early in his presidency in her confirmation hearing sen patrick toomey a republican from pennsylvania pressed shelton on her calls for the fed to cut interest rates even further to prevent the us dollar from strengthening in value relative to other currency trump has repeatedly made that argument in attacking the current chairman jerome powell who he named to the post in 2017 the white house issued a statement in defense of shelton and a second nominee christopher waller after the february 13 hearing the nominations of judy shelton and christopher waller are not being pulled said judd deere a white house spokesman in a statement both were in front of the banking committee today and the white house expects both to be confirmed by the senate to the federal reserve shelton did not respond to a cnn request for comment shelton has long advocated for returning to the gold standard which the united states abandoned in 1971 she s argued that the policy would make the dollar less susceptible to inflation or other volatility a view the majority of us economists believe would be disastrous for the us economy shelton backed away from her previous support of the gold standard in her senate hearing suggesting that it would simply be valuable for policymakers to look at it for historical use but her comments in 2011 painted the fed the world s most powerful central bank then overseen by george w bush appointee ben bernanke in a suspicious light we can appreciate the intent of those congressmen who are currently trying to put some kind of limit on the federal reserve shelton said in 2011 they sense that the fed is out of control it s almost a rogue agency in that it has become so dominant so powerful a force that financial markets are really paralyzed unless they know what ben bernanke is thinking presidents and other politicians have historically refrained from appearing to interfere in fed decision making for fear of upsetting financial markets but trump has upended that tradition openly and habitually trashing interest rate policy and fretting that the us economy is being overly constrained that view echoes what shelton a 2016 campaign adviser said in her 2011 interview for an agency that was created in 1913 to play a very passive role of temporarily providing liquidity she added basically when farmers seasonally needed more money and the banks would run out of cash then it was the fed s role to make sure that we could provide the cash knowing it was always backed by future productivity now the fed is this this behemoth so i appreciate when individuals say well what we have to do then is start reining them in maybe congress has given up its own responsibility defined by the constitution to regulate money we farm that out to the fed the fed has gotten potomac fever so now we re going to start reining them in
sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news originally posted on luckybeanz by mark harpur imagine a world where transport is free air is clean and streets are quiet imagine a world where education is attainable power available and healthcare accessible to all imagine a world where the cost of living goes down instead of up now stop imagining and watch this talk by tony seba at the end of 2019 i was feeling rather somber about the state of the world the year seemed to have been dominated by talks of climate catastrophe grossly increasing global inequality and governments failing a growing number of people then in early 2020 i came across the talk above it excited me and i was buoyed with hope for the future the reason being is that this talk was given in 2018 you see while most people reading this blog probably think that i have just been a travelling surf bum for the last few years the truth is that i have spent an increasing amount of time following the revolution what is that you ask well it is the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy and the electrification automation of many day to day tasks especially transport at some point i became invested in this concept which is why i have spent so much time following and studying it listening to the talk with the knowledge i have gained as a reference i realized that the reason 2019 seemed so tough was that we were pushing through a barrier and the result was crossing a tipping point a tipping point for those who don t know is the point at which a change or an effect cannot be stopped for those wanting to understand more about tipping points i highly recommend malcolm gladwell s book on the topic so what has caused this tipping point technology to be exact renewable energy in particular solar and lithium battery technology have passed key thresholds where they are now more economically viable than the comparable fossil fuel technologies and here is the punch it has happened sooner than anyone expected what this means is that regardless of the attempts of the fossil fuel industry to delay the transition regardless of the indifference of governments the shift towards renewable energy is happening and will now accelerate even faster than anticipated let s dive into these points chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution at 28 minutes into the video there is a graph showing the projected cost per kilowatt hour of batteries it is widely accepted that once batteries reach 100 kwh electric vehicles evs will be price comparable with internal combustion engine vehicles icev in the graph this was projected to happen in 2023 in tesla s 2018 shareholder meeting it was stated that the company should reach 100 kwh by the end of the year in 2019 vw claimed that it was buying batteries at under 100 kwh i ve also been researching batteries for an electric boat conversion and have been able to find them available for 100 kwh this is 4 to 3 years ahead of the projections in the video which as tony pointed out were seen as aggressive by many keeping with batteries at the 30 minute mark he talks about the massive battery that was installed in south australia pointing out that with only 2 of the capacity of the plants it is competing with it managed to wipe out 90 of the revenues of the system the takeaway from this is that disruptive technology only needs a small percent of the existing market to bankrupt the incumbents in the industry so let s take that idea and use the 2 figure from the battery example and look at the electric vehicle market in 2019 depending on whose numbers you use in many markets evs have already passed 2 market share in norway they are upwards of 50 with each ev sale more people will realise that evs are the future and buying an icev is just a waste of money it stands to reason that many people who would have bought an icev in the next few years may now delay the purchase to wait for the appropriate ev considering evs are becoming cheaper and icev sales are decreasing we can expect the market share of evs to increase significantly over the next couple of years the question is at what percentage do they cause ice company bankruptcy what also needs to be taken into account is that with each ev sale there is a reduced need for the ancillary products around ice vehicles such as lubrication oils transmission fluids etc i believe that 2019 was the year that that bankruptcy happened though you don t have to listen to my analysis below is a video tony put out while i was compiling this post while much of the content is the same as the previous video this one has two additional years of data to talk to oh and another piece of information that surfaced whilst composting this was tesla s q4 earnings call if we consider all the above information it is quite easy to get excited about the future one in which we are no longer killing ourselves and our planet with noxious gases though this disruption the one which tesla has become the poster child for spans far wider than just energy and transportation as tony points out in his presentation one has to look at all the industries that are underpinned by energy and transport which is just about every industry to fully grasp the implications of this and this is one of those things that seems to fly over many a bright individual s head once renewables have been installed the cost of that instillation keeps going down until it reaches zero there are very little additional inputs and maintenance costs this is in contrast to our current system which relies on the continual use and mining of resources fuel energy is needed to power the machines that mine the fuel fuel is needed to power the refineries so the new fuel is useful fuel is needed to power the vehicles that transport the fuel to the places it is needed and all of this is done using inefficient technology which looses much of the potential energy of the fuel to heat put another way the fossil fuel economy requires energy whether it be coal oil or gas to be continually pumped into it for it to continue functioning and to obtain those energy sources we need to use more energy while with renewables once the energy is put into the mining and production there is no more or very little energy needed to maintain the system it can be produced where it is needed and occurs no or very little transport costs thus it is foreseeable that we reach a stage where we have met all of our energy needs and no longer need to input energy to make energy if you think this is unlikely then consider these two points 1 in 2015 we used 17 2 terawatts of power globally if we cover an area of the earth 335 kilometers by 335 kilometers with solar panels even with moderate efficiencies achievable easily today it will provide more than 17 4 terawatts of power now consider the number of rooftops and glass buildings we have available to us or just watch this video on solar technology to realise that we already have the space without using up any additional land 2 electric motors are upwards of 90 efficient in their energy use the best ice is somewhere around 40 in ideal conditions and more like the low 30s in day to day use this is to say that as we electrify our transport and industrial systems we will use less and less power due to the gain in efficiency this brings us to the realization that energy becomes free or nearly free and so does transport once we reduce two of the most significant costs in almost all industries to nearly zero what will the effect be the cost of living goes down i don t know about you but i can t think of another time in history when the cost of living has actually gone down this isn t the future it is possible today in 2017 i wrote a post about vanlife tesla style in which i put forth the idea of a van powered entirely by solar today there is a van driving from alaska to argentina powered only by the sun this disruption is so much bigger than most realize it doesn t stick to an industry it spans cultures and is truly global it is inadvertently changing industries by its sheer nature just look at the financial industry ies from stock trading to financing to insurance these industries have traditionally been run by a handful of families companies who hoard most all the wealth they produce the same can be said for the fossil fuel economy i believe that what we will see as the disruption takes place is possibly the greatest shift in wealth that we have ever seen for instance in the stock market tesla has become such a hot topic that there is endless news about it and countless analysts commenting on it though what has become evident is that the traditional analysts and financial institutions do not have a clue when it comes to understanding this disruption while many retail investors i e you and me who are sharing their thoughts and ideas on the internet do and stand to shift a large proportion of wealth from these institutions to individuals essentially decentralizing the financial markets nowhere is this more evident than on the tesla earnings calls in which they invite questions from retail investors on the latest call it was even suggested that they no longer entertain questions from institutions while investors move their capital into renewable energy they are moving it out of fossil fuels which means that as they become less cost effective they are also starved of capital adding to the acceleration away from them and the collapse of the industry around them though don t take my word for it again while i was writing this post this idea became part of mainstream media though this shift in wealth may have us questioning exactly what wealth is after all the world s reserve currency the us dollar is underpinned by oil and propped up my a military complex with more bases around the world than there are countries to understand this one needs to dig a bit deeper into the history of the dollar i cover both of these topics in what is really going on knowing this one has to question what happens when the very resource most of the wars in the world today are being fought over loses most of its value where will these war machines turn their attention to what of all those whose job it is to work in the military what of all the workers in the fossil fuel industry what will they do will things not only get worse as these people lose their reasons for being i don t think so in the next installment i ll lay down my thoughts on why the end of the war on drugs the psychedelic revolution and sustainable agriculture give people hope and

editor s note category 5 hurricane michael barreled through the florida panhandle almost a year and a half ago leaving a swath of destruction that still has residents and businesses reeling on sunday and monday the tallahassee democrat revisits the storm s path as state officials host meetings around north florida on how best to distribute recovery money to hardest hit areas chipley sixteen months later hurricane michael remains a force in the lives of panhandle residents after whipping the region with 155 mph winds residents were burdened with the cleanup of more than 10 million cubic yards of fallen trees and building debris that s enough to fill eight empire state buildings they continue to turn their eyes to washington and tallahassee where plans and policies still are being developed on how to spend roughly 1 billion in recovery money folks like roy baker in marianna david warriner in port st joe and deborah mobley in bonifay will follow state budget negotiations that will decide the fate of more than 415 million earmarked for disaster relief over the next few weeks at the same time the state s department of economic opportunity is working on an action plan due in washington by june 1 that will guide how to spend another 735 million in federal disaster block grants in nine of the counties hit by the catastrophic storm in october 2018 residents social service workers business leaders and local government officials say they want the state either to cut the red tape blocking access to the money or do a better job in helping them to navigate the federal bureaucracy so they can start to rebuild homes schools hospitals and their lives michael plus 16 months nearly a year and a half after michael came ashore in gulf county for a day long rampage from the coast to the state line the aftershocks of that pounding still reverberate driving along interstate 10 west of quincy one can see it in woods littered with fallen trees stripped of their bark stoking fears of wildfires it s felt along cracked roads in towns dotted with vacant lots and buildings waiting to be demolished and it can be heard in the voices of residents recounting how michael destroyed their homes and how they struggle to adapt to their rearranged lives judy mount falls apart at the memory of an electric generator as a surprised gift i m sorry i m still not over this she said pausing to regain her composure as she tells the story of how she became a tallahassee resident when she starts to talk again the mention of hardware store gift cards and shoes her coworkers at the florida house of representatives gave her after the storm provokes another choked up silence the hurricane used airborne oak trees to trash mount s marianna home making it unlivable it hurled limbs with force that split the bricks in the walls and opened gaping holes in the roof to expose the contents to a pelting rain mount vacated her jackson county homestead and moved to tallahassee suddenly she had a 1 000 a month mortgage to pay for a home in which she couldn t live at the same time she needed rent money for a place to stay and went to court for a lawsuit against an insurance company over a settlement her experience is not unlike thousands of others who lived in michael s path but mount had the ability to move out of the hurricane devastated region others were left behind the storm s diaspora we re talking about people who live on social security living on 900 a month and half of their house is destroyed said cindy birge broker owner of elite realty in chipley she s also a member of the washington county advisory board for the state housing initiative partnership ship for affordable housing birge was among 50 washington and holmes county residents to attend a department of economic opportunity workshop earlier this month on how to spend 730 million of housing urban development hud disaster relief money that became available in late january she told reginald dixon the director of deo s office of disaster recovery that people need help to rehabilitate their homes now in chipley population 3 600 birge holds a waiting list of 50 people looking for a rental with about 70 80 of housing damaged or destroyed in coastal counties many people had relocated north that drove up the cost of rent in the small towns of the rural counties and left residents with damaged homes nowhere to go birge vented after she listened to dixon outline the procedure deo must follow to distribute the federal money available here we are a year and a half out and they are talking about another year before people see these funds how are people going to live two and a half years asked birge revenue streams there are two streams of money available to hurricane hit counties the immediate short term money comes from the federal emergency management agency fema it s used for debris removal temporary housing infrastructure repairs and protection measures then there is the hud money for long term housing and infrastructure and economic development that is tied to housing the fema money is handled through the florida department of emergency management dem has distributed a half billion dollars in grants and reimbursements since january 2019 the hud money goes through deo hud published rules for 735 million in block grants january 2020 residents business owners and local officials however say the flow of money for both streams is clogged by bureaucratic process and paper shuffling rules and procedures gulf county businessman david warriner is a volunteer with port st joe s historic port theatre art and culture center michael ripped the roof off rain and wind then washed away props equipment and furnishings warriner described the procedure to get an assistance grant available for nonprofits as an amazingly complicated process by a neurotic government it seems like sometimes we are just treading water and they keep putting weights on our ankles warriner said about the details and documentation requested with quick deadlines the theater was unable to meet fema s request for photographic documentation of the chairs drapery and equipment listed in the claim not that the request was unreasonable warriner added but like most community theaters his group takes photographs of performances not props and supplies and now a year after putting on a new roof the theater s application for disaster relief remains under review we put that roof on with the hope one day we will be reimbursed it s not like we have money coming out of our ears warriner said we are a theater that has been closed for two years it s kind of hard to raise revenue when you have been closed balancing needs jared moskowitz the state s emergency management director agrees that a lot of the requirements to get federal money slows things down but he adds that the state is distributing hurricane michael money faster than it has for any previous disaster we had to change things up moskowitz said about gov ron desantis approach to disaster management we immediately turned on programs that had been available to the state that we just never turned on before like the expedited payment program it could have been turned on for irma but the previous administration didn t and the audits procedures and documentation attached to public money takes time he added marking the milestone deo s dixon agrees saying the last action plan he saw submitted to hud was about 100 pages and if you are going to give someone millions of dollars then you are going to read it and go over it dixon said as the director of the office of disaster recovery dixon went on a tour of the panhandle in mid february to host workshops about the disaster recovery community development block grant provided by hud the state s action plan on how it will spend 735 million must be turned in by june 1 he explained part of his goal is to manage the expectations of the local government officials economic developers social service workers and contractors who seek money to rebuild part of what we have to convey to people on a daily basis is i totally understand why you feel the way you do and we share your frustration and if i could get the money to you faster i would dixon said once dixon submits the plan hud has 45 days to approve it then the state and hud must negotiate a grant agreement to release the money that can take up to 18 months i don t accept that but i have no choice said roy s baker coordinator with opportunity florida a nine county economic development agency it always comes down to the one with the money is the one who writes the rules he describes the region s recovery effort as strapped tied down by too few workers to rebuild and further hampered by a lack of money for housing for the workers needed to rebuild our recovery is very vulnerable right now baker said but you have to give credit to disaster recovery at deo we ve talked to them for a year about this and they ve heard us they ve been above board with us waiting and hoping an hour south in springfield local officials tell a similar story about government assistance mayor ralph hammond s city of 9 000 lost its city hall police station fire station community building and elementary and middle schools seventy six percent of springfield s homes and 96 of its churches were damaged or destroyed by michael it s like we re building a city from the ground floor hammond said hammond has a 15 million bill for debris cleanup but his city s annual budget is just 14 million he said the city is waiting for fema funds to continue the cleanup and dig the city out of debt but that is how fema works federal to state state to local hammond said he lauded state officials for the encouragement and help dem has given to his community but said he d like to get some of these projects up and moving before another event starts if there is a way to speed things up we would be more than happy hurricane money on

after two years of economic fallout from a trade war between the united states and china finance ministers and other senior officials at the group of 20 meeting in riyadh expressed alarm about an impasse over plans by foreign governments to impose new taxes on us technology companies if a deal proves elusive in the coming months european countries will begin collecting levies which would probably set off retaliatory tariffs from the united states the trade tensions of today would look like they are not so serious compared to the consequences of something like this angel gurría secretary general of the organization for economic cooperation and development said in an interview on the sidelines of the g 20 on saturday there s the cacophony the trade tensions that would invariably follow and then there s the impact on growth several european countries led by france have been rolling out digital services taxes which would hit american companies like amazon google and facebook italy spain austria and the united kingdom have all announced plans for digital services taxes which assess a levy based on the online activity that takes place in those countries regardless of whether the company has a physical presence the oecd has been trying to head off a proliferation of disparate tax regimes around the world and has been leading negotiations over the last year for an international overhaul that would allow countries to tax certain digital service providers even if they lack physical operations inside their borders negotiators have set an end of year deadline to broker a deal that would set international standards for how and where online activity may be taxed also under discussion is whether to impose a global minimum tax of sorts on multinational corporations to discourage companies from shifting profits to low tax countries like ireland and bermuda to minimise their tax bills the united states along with the tech industry has been eager to prevent a proliferation of new digital taxes across the world and has pushed for a global tax regime that would govern all oecd countries but the talks hit a snag late last year when treasury secretary steven mnuchin told the oecd that the united states wanted american companies to essentially have the option to avoid some of the taxes some administration officials privately express concerns that the global minimum tax under discussion could discourage countries from further reducing their corporate tax rates as the united states did in 2017 lower rates these officials argue make their economies more attractive to global investment and help companies other economists say the competition to lower rates have encouraged firms to shift profits at least on paper to tax havens the economic effect of the digital services taxes on the united states is relatively small but us companies fear the levies could evolve to hit a broader swath of sectors beyond tech a recent analysis by the oecd found that the international tax changes under consideration would increase global corporate taxes by about 100 billion file employees work at a facebook office set up to monitor misuse of the platform in dublin may 2 2019 the world s top economic leaders warned at the g20 in riyadh that an international tax fight between the united states and europe poses a new threat to the global economy if a resolution is not reached this year paulo nunes dos santos the new york times the taxes have drawn the ire of president donald trump who has criticised europe s attempt to collect more taxes from american companies last year trump said the united states would retaliate against france s digital tax by imposing tariffs of up to 100 on french products such as wine cheese and handbags the united states agreed last month to delay those tariffs and france agreed to delay collection of the taxes in the hope that a more global agreement could be reached

cnn president donald trump s federal reserve nominee judy shelton said in 2011 that the central bank was almost a rogue agency in the us government and had become a behemoth that couldn t be trusted with oversight of the dollar our government is promising so much to so many and at the same time we let the government control the value of our money and all of that would really go against the grain with our founders who did not see it as the government s task to supply everything to everybody she said they saw the government s task to be to protect private property and that s why they wanted limited government because they knew she added it s just the nature of having power that causes people in power to abuse the privilege i think we re now at a point where we have to ask if we can even trust government to regulate the value of our money shelton a gold standard enthusiast made the comments in a 2011 interview with the the atlas network which increases global prosperity by strengthening a network of independent partner organizations that promote individual freedom and are committed to identifying and removing barriers to human flourishing cnn reported last week that shelton is facing an uphill battle to win senate confirmation after three republicans said they were undecided on whether they will support her nomination republicans have one more seat than democrats on the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee if any republican senator votes against her nomination it would result in a tie that would likely end her nomination shelton s nomination came after two trump picks stephen moore and herman cain withdrew from consideration amid controversy before being formally nominated she has a doctorate in business administration from the university of utah and was a fellow for many years at stanford s hoover institution trump appointed her to be united states executive director of the european bank for reconstruction and development early in his presidency in her confirmation hearing sen patrick toomey a republican from pennsylvania pressed shelton on her calls for the fed to cut interest rates even further to prevent the us dollar from strengthening in value relative to other currency trump has repeatedly made that argument in attacking the current chairman jerome powell who he named to the post in 2017 the white house issued a statement in defense of shelton and a second nominee christopher waller after the february 13 hearing the nominations of judy shelton and christopher waller are not being pulled said judd deere a white house spokesman in a statement both were in front of the banking committee today and the white house expects both to be confirmed by the senate to the federal reserve shelton did not respond to a cnn request for comment shelton has long advocated for returning to the gold standard which the united states abandoned in 1971 she s argued that the policy would make the dollar less susceptible to inflation or other volatility a view the majority of us economists believe would be disastrous for the us economy shelton backed away from her previous support of the gold standard in her senate hearing suggesting that it would simply be valuable for policymakers to look at it for historical use but her comments in 2011 painted the fed the world s most powerful central bank then overseen by george w bush appointee ben bernanke in a suspicious light we can appreciate the intent of those congressmen who are currently trying to put some kind of limit on the federal reserve shelton said in 2011 they sense that the fed is out of control it s almost a rogue agency in that it has become so dominant so powerful a force that financial markets are really paralyzed unless they know what ben bernanke is thinking presidents and other politicians have historically refrained from appearing to interfere in fed decision making for fear of upsetting financial markets but trump has upended that tradition openly and habitually trashing interest rate policy and fretting that the us economy is being overly constrained that view echoes what shelton a 2016 campaign adviser said in her 2011 interview for an agency that was created in 1913 to play a very passive role of temporarily providing liquidity she added basically when farmers seasonally needed more money and the banks would run out of cash then it was the fed s role to make sure that we could provide the cash knowing it was always backed by future productivity now the fed is this this behemoth so i appreciate when individuals say well what we have to do then is start reining them in maybe congress has given up its own responsibility defined by the constitution to regulate money we farm that out to the fed the fed has gotten potomac fever so now we re going to start reining them in
file in this nov 5 2018 file photo supporters of president donald trump wait for him to arrive to speak at a rally at allen county war memorial coliseum in fort wayne ind vice president mike pence has a favorite line when he introduces president donald trump at rallies he says it s been three years of promises made and promises kept under trump is it true the associated press reviewed what s happened with trump s key campaign promises ap photo carolyn kaster file washington d c it s been three years of promises made and promises kept but we re just getting started insert state here that line from vice president mike pence is a hallmark of how he introduces president donald trump to campaign rally audiences last week he delivered versions at rallies in colorado springs and las vegas recommended videos but is it true in some respects yes trump has followed through on promises to cut regulations and renegotiate trade deals and to donate his salary just to name a few but in many critical areas promises made by the president have not been promises kept a look at some areas where rhetoric has not matched reality economic growth the economy under trump will grow at a sustainable rate of at least 3 5 percent and as high as 4 percent the promise was part of the president s contract with the american voter that was released in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election and fed the story line that he would light a fire under an obama economy that republicans repeatedly categorized as sluggish what happened growth has largely followed the same trends of the obama era even after the stimulus from the 2017 tax cuts the nation s economy or gross domestic product grew at a rate of 2 4 percent in the president s first year in office 2 9 percent in 2018 and 2 3 percent last year the gains mean the economy is improving just not as rapidly as what trump pledged to voters and that makes it difficult to build the political will to pay for his other stated initiatives such as fixing the nation s infrastructure ___ federal debt when declaring his candidacy trump said he would reduce our 18 trillion in debt he later took those vows a step farther declaring that he would not just balance the budget but pay down the entire national debt what happened the opposite the u s budget deficit through the first four months of this budget year is up 19 from the same period a year ago putting the country on track to record its first 1 trillion deficit since 2012 the deficit reflected government spending that has grown 10 3 this budget year while revenues were up only 6 1 the deficit has gone up every year of trump s presidency the national debt now stands at more than 23 trillion __ the border wall when announcing his white house run on june 16 2015 trump declared i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall what happened mexico isn t paying the president has tried in multiple ways to demonstrate otherwise he has argued that the updated u s trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal but nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico he told supporters at a rally that redemption money is paying for the wall redemption payments don t exist trump apparently meant to cite remittances that refers to money that immigrants in the u s send to their countries of origin often to family members trump has at various times talked about taxing or blocking such money but that has not been done instead the president has diverted money from military construction projects and approved using counter drug spending to pay for wall construction the reliance on pentagon money continued anew this month when 3 8 billion previously authorized for f 35 fighter aircraft and other military programs was diverted to help build portions of the border wall __ taxes to make his proposed tax cuts more palatable to voters trump dangled the idea that tax rates would go up for the rich in may 2016 he told nbc for the wealthy i think frankly it is going to go up and you know what it really should go up what happened taxes on the rich went down not up in the vast majority of cases the top income tax rate fell from 39 6 to 37 as a result of the changes republicans made to the tax code the new cap on state and local tax deductions limited the benefits for some of the very rich but households earning more than 1 million saved on average more than 64 000 last year according to an analysis by congress joint committee on taxation people earning 50 000 to 100 000 got about a 1 000 cut from their income taxes
many democrats are completely fixated on getting donald trump out of the oval office no matter what it takes or which democratic presidential candidate while that s certainly an important and obvious goal the political stakes in 2020 are far far greater than that yes there are compounding existential and political crises that go beyond corrupt beltway intrigue so much of the media fixates on capitalism is in crisis it is manifested in the deterioration in local conditions a decline in the birthrate as well as in entrepreneurship the blooming orange despot is merely the flower on top of the cactus our national slide happened in concert with wealth concentration accelerating and income disparity becoming even more pronounced it should come as no surprise that in our increasingly winner take all society the power of multinational monopolies grows by the day yet most americans likely do not grasp the gravity of the national moment locally because between 2008 and 2018 the country lost 47 percent of the newspaper reporters that do the kind of work i do at the chief leader we cover things like the rise in violent attacks on bus drivers and emergency medical service personnel and the surge in the ranks of the homeless mentally ill in our public libraries transit systems and jails as a transport worker union official told me after yet another brutal assault on a bus driver what we are seeing is an erosion of the basic social contract you need for safe mass public transit add in the existential threat of climate change and it appears that american have to rearrange things politically speaking radically and quickly the united states has been unraveling for a while now both along main street and martin luther king blvd there are huge swaths of the country in the rust belt and rural america where the decline is measured in a dip in life expectancy increased suicides alcohol and substance abuse related premature deaths these trends have been decades in the making and yet because of the decline of local and regional newsmedia a phenomenon driven by silicon valley the deterioration of american civilization is overlooked and under discussed you can observe this in the current 2020 presidential debates and stump speeches most democratic candidates aside from senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren promote the idea that america is flawed but still great and that economic opportunities are still rife for our population the rise of trump came in part because the corporate news media physically concentrated along i 95 failed to grasp this socioeconomic slide driven by decades of declining or flat wages paired with the massive rise of household medical and student debt this all happened as our congress became richer and richer and our politics increasingly served corporate interests simultaneously the beltway became increasingly out of touch with that 40 percent of the country the federal reserve tells us would have a hard time coming up with 400 to cover an emergency in march of 2016 the trump campaign was cranking up and former secretary of state hillary clinton was running her campaign on the strength of president obama s economy yet it was clear to me as it was evidently to many americans who were unswayed by her pitch that the alleged recovery was a construct of abstract data points including the national unemployment number no one lives dies or votes in the aggregate to know what s really going on main street and mlk boulevard you need to study county level data in 2016 the national association of counties reported that out of the nation s 3 069 counties only 214 had actually recovered based on the four criteria they used county unemployment rate job creation gdp growth and the median home price moreover of the 126 largest counties with more than a half million residents only 17 had recovered in places like cleveland and newark zombie homes abandoned by families forced out by the banks depressed the value of the homes that were occupied wall street was saved but local streets were left to their own devices and this dislocation endures to this very day and so the nation s elites were just stunned to learn that despite winning three million more popular votes than her opponent ms clinton came up short in the places the corporate news media had been ignoring now under the misrule of trump wealth concentration has accelerated as corporations took their tax savings and plowed it back into self serving stock buybacks and bonuses instead of actually investing in their businesses or employees in 2018 eduardo porter writing for the new york times insightfully framed the question can the market economy still deliver prosperity belying breathless headlines about the fabulous opportunities that technology is about to bestow on society it suggests that many rich market democracies have lost much of their dynamism porter writes their companies are getting old and their labor markets are getting stuck productivity growth has slumped and many workers in their prime are peeling off from the labor force this continued unraveling and further notice stagnation is seen in the wave of retail store front vacancies as a tax dodging colossus like amazon squeezes brick and mortar businesses out of existence in 2018 5 844 stores closed last year there were 9 300 while on the business news cable shows this is just reported as a quirky trend for local municipal officials it means the erosion of employment their tax base and the locally based charity that only comes from a going concern this multi faceted decline is reflected in the nation s scandalous maternal mortality rate and the vast racial disparity revealed in that data maternal mortality is often used as an international indicator of the health of a population overall wrote gaby galvin for u s news world report from 1990 to 2013 research published in medical journal the lancet found that on average developed countries saw a 3 1 annual decline in an assessment of maternal mortality ratio the u s however saw an annual increase of 1 7 at the same time as we neglect our mothers and newborns we are in the midst of what the centers for disease control and prevention says is a record decline in our birthrate indeed it has dropped to a 32 year low and 2018 was the fourth year in a row that our birthrate dropped down 2 percent from where it was in 2017 the demographic implications are profound for our country in terms of the sustainability of systems like social security it s a national problem dowell myers a demographer at the university of southern california told npr the birthrate is a barometer of despair which myers told the broadcaster was a sign that the country s young people weren t sufficiently optimistic to want to bring another life into the world with the total cultural fixation on trump his corrupt machinations and the dnc horse race we are not seeing the bigger picture an america too afraid of the future to start a business or to have a baby the time for a locally organized national renewal is long overdue
warren buffett on saturday forcefully defended berkshire hathaway inc s decision to invest heavily in stocks of companies such as apple inc as he labors through a four year drought since his last major acquisition of a company buffett 89 also used his annual letter to berkshire shareholders to assure they should not worry about the future of the company which is 100 prepared for when he and 96 year old vice chairman charlie munger are no longer around berkshire also posted record full year earnings of 81 42 billion nearly twice the prior high from 2017 boosted by unrealized gains from its stock investments operating profit however fell 3 to 23 97 billion advertisement the omaha nebraska based conglomerate ended the year with a 128 billion cash hoard after repurchasing 2 2 billion of stock in the fourth quarter and 5 billion in 2019 i do think it s on the right path said james armstrong president of henry h armstrong associates in pittsburgh which invests one fourth of its assets in berkshire its balance sheet is exactly the type of toolkit you d like to leave a successor berkshire has more than 90 units employing 391 539 people including the bnsf railroad geico car insurer dairy queen ice cream and see s candies clothing and jewelry companies and namesake utility and real estate brokerage businesses read wealth creation will lead to growth that s what the govt needs to focus on pawan goenka advertisement it also invests in such companies as american express co bank of america corp and coca cola co berkshire ended the year with a 128 billion cash hoard having made no major acquisitions since paying 32 1 billion in january 2016 for aircraft parts maker precision castparts and buffett lamented his inability to find big companies to buy the opportunities to make major acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare he wrote buffett s letters have grown shorter in recent years with less humor and less discussion about the economy and investing advertisement james shanahan an edward jones co analyst who rates berkshire a buy called saturday s letter a missed opportunity to show how berkshire whose stock has trailed the standard poor s 500 over the last decade is undervalued it felt much more businesslike and detached and lost some of the wisdom that made it so entertaining he said american tailwind revisited the record profit is largely the result of an accounting rule that buffett urges investors to ignore requiring berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income buffett whose 90 2 billion net worth makes him the world s fourth richest person according to forbes magazine said that while he still prefers buying whole companies stocks are a better bet than low yielding bonds advertisement he attributed that in part to the american tailwind or the economy s ability to grow despite roadblocks such as war high inflation and financial panic if something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long term fixed rate debt instruments he wrote buffett s comments surprised stephen dodson who manages the bretton fund which owns berkshire shares i was expecting him to say the market was expensive dodson said he didn t even hint that advertisement the cash stake has nonetheless been a drag for investors in 2019 berkshire s stock rose 11 while the s p 500 including dividends rose 31 5 the biggest shortfall in a decade succession buffett also used his letter to comfort investors that berkshire will be in good hands after he leaves in 2018 berkshire promoted greg abel 57 and ajit jain 68 to vice chairmen giving them oversight of berkshire s non insurance and insurance operations respectively and freeing buffett and munger to focus on deploying capital buffett also has portfolio managers todd combs and ted weschler helping him buy stocks combs 49 on jan 1 also became geico s chief executive charlie and i long ago entered the urgent zone buffett wrote that s not exactly great news for us but berkshire shareholders need not worry your company is 100 prepared for our departure he also said shareholders will be able to ask abel and jain questions at berkshire s annual meeting on may 2 where buffett and munger normally do most of the talking advertisement i m comfortable with how berkshire is moving up the next generation said thomas russo a partner at gardner russo gardner in lancaster pennsylvania a longtime berkshire shareholder buffett said his estate may need 12 to 15 years to dispose of his berkshire stock which is going to charities including the bill melinda gates foundation and berkshire stock will be a safe and rewarding investment during that time the disposal plan gives investors the ability to focus on everything else said david marcus chief investment officer at evermore global advisors who personally owns berkshire shares if buffett weren t the age that he is it wouldn t matter
a harsh indictment but the film is persuasive showing how powdered milk from america purchased from subsidized american dairy farmers and dumped at a loss has destroyed the jamaican fresh milk industry and how even the one remaining market for jamaican bananas england is threatened by the chiquita dole del monte forces who think one jamaican banana not sold by them is too many latin american banana workers earn 1 a day jamaicans can t live on that other markets reflect the same policies subsidized idaho potatoes have bankrupted jamaican potato farmers mcdonald s refuses to buy local meat sweet jamaican onions are underpriced by american onions sold at a loss and so on one scheme to help the jamaican economy the film says has been the establishment of free zones fenced in manufacturing areas where workers are paid 30 a week to assemble goods which arrive and leave by container ship without legally being on jamaican soil labor unions are banned working conditions are subhuman strikers are forced back to work at gunpoint and paychecks are taxed for health and retirement schemes that don t seem to exist the hanes clothing division of chicago s sara lee company was one of the beneficiaries until the movie says it pulled out to find even cheaper workers elsewhere the imf ideally lends money which can be used to help local businesses but as former jamaican prime minister michael manley observes it charges twice the world rate for interest and forbids the country from charging its own lenders less an imf backed small business loan in jamaica might carry 25 percent interest you ask whose interest is the imf serving manley says ask who set it up imf policies can be changed only by an 80 percent vote the united states japan germany england canada and italy control more than 80 percent of the votes the bottom line developing economies of the third world are deliberately destroyed and turned into captive markets for the rich nations while their once self sufficient inhabitants become cheap labor and local competition is penalized are these charges true i do not have the expertise to say i only bring you the news that this documentary which has played twice on pbs and is now at the music box exists if you re curious about why the demonstrators are so angry this is why they re so angry
one of the agencies for which i had responsibility was ausaid the agency that oversaw australia s overseas aid program it has subsequently been abolished and its functions rolled into the department of foreign affairs and trade i think that has been a mistake but that s another story this reminds me of that cynical saying about foreign aid that poor people in rich countries are taxed to pay rich people in poor countries ausaid spent a sizeable amount of money in those days somewhere in the vicinity of 3 billion a year now we spend over 4 billion a year on aid not surprisingly i was pretty interested in how it spent that money more than that i really wanted to know how effective its budget was in alleviating poverty after all that was meant to be the point of foreign aid we wanted to make countries in our neighbourhood rich rather than allow them to wallow in poverty so i asked the senior ausaid officials a very simple question why are some countries rich and others poor they mumbled as people usually do when they don t know the answer to a question telling me that there were complex issues foreign aid trap well i didn t agree with them i told them the issues weren t complex there was one simple issue in almost every case countries which were poor were badly governed that sentiment was reinforced by the totemic book why nations fail published by two american academics a decade or so ago it s well worth reading advertisement so back to the world bank last week it published a report into foreign aid its research shows that the more dependent countries are on foreign aid the more of it is siphoned off by the politicians senior bureaucrats and their cronies into offshore bank accounts for their benefit in other words the people who run the countries that get the most aid tend to be corrupt the world bank report says that over a period of 20 years as soon as the world bank made payments to the 22 countries they analysed there was a surge in capital flows from those countries into tax havens the surge in these capital flows was up to 15 per cent of the aid paid and the average was around 7 5 per cent ah this reminds me of that cynical saying of the great economist peter bauer who said of foreign aid that poor people in rich countries are taxed to pay rich people in poor countries i don t want to disillusion you and make you think that foreign aid only goes to prop up corrupt political leaders but a lot of it is wasted without focusing on the real causes of economic failure png program australia has for many years given huge amounts of money to papua new guinea when i became the foreign minister we were already part of the way through a program instituted by the hawke government to phase out cash support for papua new guinea s government and replace it with project aid i completed that program i didn t want to see any cash paid into the papua new guinea budget advertisement but here s the problem even when we provided project aid it didn t eliminate corruption for every dollar we spent on schools or hospitals in papua new guinea the papua new guinean government had a dollar it didn t need to spend on those things it could spend that money on something else there were all sorts of imaginative schemes going on which lined the pockets of senior officials and some politicians believe me i knew about these schemes and although our aid wasn t directly supporting these nefarious activities we left them with more money to spend on those things while we carried the burden of some of their education and health budgets anyway i did what i could i tried to direct more of our aid into good governance programs in the case of papua new guinea i told its then prime minister michael somare we wouldn t continue a substantial aid program unless there were measurable improvements in the quality of governance and a decline in corruption we introduced what we called the enhanced cooperation program which included putting australian public servants into advisory positions in papua new guinea and government departments not surprisingly sir michael was very resistant to this program nevertheless we managed to force it through after all if we had reduced our a program substantially then the papua new guinea government would have had to carry more of the burden for health and education and that would leave less money for other things the enhanced cooperation program only had limited success but it certainly has been worth a try to be frank it would be a diplomatic disaster to lecture other countries about being badly governed the very least we can do is politely contribute to improving the skills know how and system of their public services

the u s federal government s disastrous response to puerto rico after hurricane maria illustrates a longstanding history of an exploitative domestic policy on the island recent earthquakes have not only rocked puerto rico s infrastructure but have emphasized the united states s negligence of its own citizens journalist and columbia university professor ed morales describes puerto rico as the symbol of marginalized communities all over the u s and the world he joins activist and scholar rosa clemente to discuss the personal and political implications of the island s ongoing debt crisis recovery efforts and an intersectional movement that challenges the political establishment laura flanders rosa i got to start with you because the last time i was looking at you you were just back from the island you were saying we re looking at a puerto rico for finance and not for people what does it look like now rosa clemente i still believe that the ultimate goal will be to have puerto rico but no puerto ricans in it and the more these two years have passed with the work of naomi klein and ed and yarimar bonilla really kind of laying out what we thought was potentially going to happen but when you begin to read it and how they ve all contextualized it it s very real and i think we have to understand more that there are a group of particularly young white rich men that want to try out all this cryptocurrency and bitcoin and see puerto rico as the staging ground for that talk a bit about what this fantasy has been to you because this is personal this is family fantasy ed morales there s a lot of people who knew that was a fantasy all along but when you get to the average puerto rican like my family and some people that i know they really felt like the status was working for them on a certain level they were able to have a middle class home and a car and go shopping at malls like you have in the united states but the economy of puerto rico was never self sustaining and the government has been in debt going all the way back to the 70s to ameliorate that was it never self sustaining never could ve been self sustaining or was it created not self sustaining which is to say dependent morales yes it was never self sustaining because well first of all puerto rico was a colony of spain for 400 years before the united states and they were collaborators with the spanish colonialism as well and they were the ones who had most of the property in the sugar industry but when the u s came in they adjusted the tax laws to favor outside interest and the u s sugar companies were able to take over most of the best land for sugar and the u s economy started to dominate the puerto rican economy and it was never really allowed to grow on its own the jones act it impossible for trade to happen the u s set up puerto rico as a free trade zone in the early 20th century as a prelude to nafta in a way by just there were no duties charged to the u s for imports from puerto rico and then the u s dumped all of its consumer stuff that it wasn t selling in the u s onto puerto rico talk about the is it called the downes bidwell case that determined the status and contextualize that a little bit for us morales what happened in the 19th century with a lot of territories that the u s acquired which were put on the road to statehood like a lot of the places in the middle of the country and in the west those were thought of as incorporated territories which meant that they were on the paths statehood but at the end of the 19th century when the u s decided to start this colonial empire and expand beyond its borders to maybe create a security zone in the caribbean and to the south fighting the war with spain they acquired these territories filled with people who they mistrusted or were just outright racist towards because they were not white they were mixed there s a lot of prejudice against mixed people as well they would say things like mixed people have the worst aspects of both white and black so they did not consider puerto rico or the philippines as candidates for statehood and they created this new category called unincorporated territory and downes v bidwell which was decided on by two of the same supreme court judges that decided on plessy v ferguson which established separate but equal they said that puerto rico was belonging to but not a part of the u s and so what that allowed them to do was treat puerto rico in ways that was advantage to the united states for instance they gave puerto rico the title of state so that it couldn t declare bankruptcy they did it that way but when it was to their advantage to consider puerto rico a foreign area then they consider it as foreign and that s constantly still being done what has this scenario meant for you your family your life clemente so i would say when the hurricane hit my parents called and was like you re going right and i said yeah i got to raise some money but i m going when i visited my titi in the hospital in bayamón at first they weren t letting anybody go in they were very afraid of infections and when they let me go in i had to put on a hazmat kind of suit so not to get other people sick and she was in so much pain because she lost everything in the house and had broken her leg she had an infection and the nurse said at this time we re only doing surgeries to save people s lives right now so the part that my aunt was in was where eventually people would have to have amputation because they didn t even have medicine to stop the infection so it s real it s visceral the older i ve gotten i understand exactly what puerto rico is and the colonial status so for me when i got there in july and saw the unity of various different puerto ricans you might believe in statehood independence colonial you might ve been gone from the island you might be coming back to the island from here the united states it was like that moment i always prayed for i was like oh this is it it reminded me of the struggle around vieques at one point everybody might ve had a different political solution but we knew immediately that vieques has to we have to stop it from being a bombing range the u s base that the navy was using for weapons testing clemente right and on may 1 2003 that victory happened and the u s navy left now to this day they ve never cleaned it up and at the moment vieques doesn t have a hospital so anybody that gets sick in vieques have to go to fajardo but when i was at those protests to see the amount of young people to see lgbtq trans puerto ricans to see anarchist leaning young people to see feminists i mean even walking through old san juan they had changed all the names of the streets put tags over them like this is not calle de la fortaleza now this is calle libertad morales it was like a new kind of nationalism for me it was like an intersectional nationalism because a lot of the failings of nationalism in the past been that it s been too patriarchal male dominated and so this inclusivity of women who were at the forefront and lgbtq people i thought was really encouraging and a model for what could happen in the u s or what is sort of happening in the u s a little bit is there a chance that this whole ricky resign movement could stay focused on the systemic corruption that you re talking about and maybe the direction of development for the island clemente i think what a lot of people don t know is that before that five days before the fbi indicted julia keleher the secretary of education and her entire staff for corruption for stealing julia keleher s the one that gave the go ahead to close over 200 schools in puerto rico she also has ties to betsy devos so it s like you peel one layer and you re like okay right and then this do we want a governor that s going to still represent the same type of corruption ricky resign that movement powerful enough to oust this governor although maybe not get to the heart of everything what happens to it now clemente well what has been happening i think also that the intersection of particularly young black puerto ricans taking leadership affirming who they are i think that s always important step toward liberation and we re seeing that really play out culturally and politically on the island which is exciting and now they have been having people s assemblies there s even people who are rewriting what a puerto rican constitution can look like for me those are signs of empowerment they re signs that say we can no longer depend on some governmental structure or an elected official you write repeatedly in the book that there are ways in which puerto rico has been a canary in the coal mine for people in the u s would you read a little part that speaks to that because over and over again in your book that comes across morales even as the real crisis began to snowball in puerto rico it would not become apparent to the united states largely because there has been traditionally almost no media coverage outside of the laura flanders show of the island outside of the occasional crime wave or hurricane in fact awareness of the crisis would become widespread at first only through the business press which i had to spend hours going over we saw a threat to not only american investors but also the municipal debt market itself but the mainstream awareness of puerto ricans as a people and a nation has created a formidable discourse one that would emerge suddenly to disrupt the stark silences and to directly or indirectly remind america that the loss wall street and congress had worked so hard to externalize will not be so easily when the people who must pay for it are not as separate as had been thought through the debt crisis as much as the united states tried to maintain its distance puerto rico would finally become a permanent internal problem and that really symbolizes how puerto rico is a symbol of marginalized communities all over the u s and the world that the debt crisis in puerto rico bears a lot of resemblance to the financial crisis of 2008 where they had all of these bad mortgages that they gave to people who couldn t afford to pay them back it s a very similar mechanism both of you thank you for your book ed it s beautiful and continue to do the reporting you re doing rosa and we ll continue to play it clemente thank you laura for continuing to cover puerto rico before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of publishing truthout has been a stalwart independent news publication for over two decades since our founding in 2001 we ve relied on reader donations to fund our work and by eschewing corporate money and advertising we maintain our

foreign companies going unpaid creditor countries told to be patient as cuba struggles under the weight of us sanctions it has also been struggling to pay its debts raising serious concern among its partners having negotiated a restructuring of its debt with 14 countries through the paris club of creditors in 2015 cuba last year failed to make timely payments to six of them austria belgium britain france japan and spain the caribbean nation was supposed to pay those countries 32 to 33 million of the total 82 million due in 2019 one diplomatic source said its failure to do so leaves it facing stiff interest payments of 9 percent facing this difficult problem cuba s deputy prime minister ricardo cabrisas has sought to offer reassurance in a letter to paris club president odile renaud basso and seen by afp he promised that cuba would make its overdue payments by the end of may they have to propose a precise calendar one ambassador said expressing the general sense of impatience even while admitting that the cuban government is going through a bad pass they have no liquidity several diplomats interviewed by afp expressed concern over what they said was the precedent of the overdue payments as one european diplomat put it they said they were going to pay their debts there is no plan there is a lack of credibility another diplomat noted that we met cabrisas at the beginning of the year and he had a defeatist tone but he told us that his country really did not want to default as it did in 1986 when it suspended its debt payments the communist island was largely cut off from international markets from then until the 2010s when several countries canceled the majority of cuba s debt china in 2011 forgave 6 billion in debt mexico in 2013 canceled 400 million and russia in 2014 forgave 35 billion the paris club accord helped put the cuban economy back on track as 14 countries agreed to wipe out 8 5 billion of the 11 1 billion due with the remainder converted into investment projects or rescheduled to fall due through 2033 most of those countries are european and the european union has become cuba s leading investor and principal trading partner eu cuban commercial transactions exceeded 3 47 billion in 2018 even as political dialogue between the two sides sharply escalated the incomplete payment to the paris club creditors demonstrates the complexity of cuba s economic and financial situation said pavel vidal a cuban economist at the javeriana university in cali colombia for at least three years cuba has shown all the symptoms of an economy in recession and with a balance of payments crisis vidal said breaking out of that vicious circle is complicated without the aid of an international lender of last resort like the imf especially in the face of escalating american sanctions and the effects of the venezuelan crisis cuba has faced a hardening of the 58 year old us embargo since donald trump arrived in the white house with laws penalizing foreign companies pressuring banks and limiting visits by americans it has also suffered from the effects of the economic and political crisis in venezuela its most important ally and leading petroleum supplier while its own major revenue sources have waned the influx of tourists declined by 9 3 percent last year from 2018 its first drop in 10 years while its income producing deployment of physicians abroad suffered as 9 000 of them returned home amid diplomatic spats notably with brazil with which cuba fell into default in mid 2018 cuba s external debt surged by 53 percent between 2013 and 2016 to 18 2 billion according to the latest official data what worries me most is the other debt that created by the credits extended by suppliers who often have to wait two years to be paid said cuban economist omar everleny perez spanish companies the most numerous among the suppliers are owed an accumulated 300 million euros 325 000 according to an estimate from the spanish government of course the american sanctions affect cuba s ability to reimburse its creditors perez said but because the agreement with the paris club is politically important he believes havana is going to pay but that is not going to solve the long term problem he added perez criticized the cuban government s failure to pass economic reforms to stimulate the private sector and spark growth meantime the london club a group of private creditors that is something of a counterpart to the paris club s public creditors holds several hundred million dollars of the island s commercial debt and has been trying in vain since 2013 to negotiate an accord with cuba one member of the club investment fund crf i ltd has filed a formal claim with britain s high court we are losing patience said its president david charters if cuba wants to access international financial markets again they need to clear this up

by leika kihara francesco canepa and howard schneider riyadh washington reuters central bankers from the united states japan and the euro zone meeting in the desert kingdom of saudi arabia this weekend had their own shifting sands to cross those of elusive inflation the problem facing all three is that price growth has long stopped behaving as expected as aging populations and technological advances prevent inflation from meeting their cherished 2 target despite aggressive stimulus measures related stories this is leading to a deep rethink by the world s most powerful central banks starting from how they define their goal and what tools they use to achieve it a process that was becoming even more urgent as the world braced for the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak the meeting of finance leaders from the world s 20 top economies in riyadh provided a chance for federal reserve chairman jerome powell ecb president christine lagarde and bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda to compare notes lagarde was due to meet powell later on sunday having had a brief exchange with kuroda the previous day the major central banks all face similar problems including how to deal with another economic downturn said an executive of one of the banks present at the g20 meeting they ve been discussing this topic for a while it s about time they come up with some form of conclusion he said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter kuroda has plenty of lessons to offer on the dangers of keeping subdued price growth unattended for too long he deployed a heavy dose of stimulus in 2013 only to see inflation stagnate at levels well below its 2 target mindful of such dangers the fed is in the midst of its framework review that focuses on how it should pursue 2 inflation using tools such as forward guidance in its own review the ecb is all but certain to overhaul its inflation goal defined as a rate of price growth below but close to 2 to signal it does not see that level as a ceiling inflation can be economically and politically destructive if prices rise too fast but a moderate pace such as 2 is seen as needed to enable companies to raise wages and create a virtuous cycle for the economy powerful forces critics doubt whether tweaks to the definition of price goals would be effective in battling headwinds from demographics and technological innovation older populations tend to consume less while new technologies foster greater efficiency at a lower cost together they can be powerful forces leaning against inflation to tackle this the fed has looked into ideas such as a make up strategy under which a central bank promises to allow inflation to run above target to make up for times of weakness in the economy but that would tie the hands of future policymakers a risky strategy it works beautifully in models thomas barkin president of the federal reserve bank of richmond it makes me nervous in practice many boj officials too are wary of doing another framework review and doubt any tweak to the inflation target will help people believe more strongly that prices will rise there are doubts within the boj on whether pledging to achieve higher inflation could change public perceptions dramatically especially if inflation is still distant from the current target said a source familiar with its thinking with no clear breakthrough on other tools central banks have at their disposal managing public expectations is now among their strongest weapons and yet the rising cost of prolonged low interest rates from soaring property prices to vanishing returns for pension funds means central banks cannot just stand by hoping inflation will perk up some day the side effects are more acute now and i think we should tone down our communication that benefits far outweigh the costs an ecb policymaker said on condition of anonymity rejecting the idea that interest rates could stay low forever imf managing director kristalina georgieva likened policymakers complacency to a frog who doesn t realize it is swimming in gradually heating water until it is too late this is the risk that we are facing she told a conference this week held on the sidelines of the g20 meeting that an incremental pileup of debt in a low interest environment doesn t give us a good signal to jump out of the boiling water reporting by leika kihara and francesco canepa in riyadh with howard schneider in washington additional reporting by andrea shalal in riyadh editing by david holmes

it s time for president donald trump to declare victory and end his trade wars with the election just nine months away it would help both the economy and his reelection prospects economies boom and slump for many reasons and politicians often get too much credit and too much blame for both still an administration s policies can have a significant effect on the economy s performance and in trump s case his tax cuts and general easing of business regulation likely contributed to the economy s strong performance during his first three years in office however the trade wars trump has initiated have had the opposite effect slowing the u s and global economies roughly half of all u s imports are raw materials or intermediate goods that are part of the production process for u s based firms tariffs and restrictions put in place during trade wars increase business costs and slow economic growth similarly when other countries retaliate against u s trade restrictions by erecting their own trade barriers u s exporters are harmed those are the direct effects but there s more trade wars also create uncertainty which is anathema to business planning this leads businesses to hold back on new investments in their global supply chains this too retards growth the united states mexico canada trade agreement is one important step in the right direction canada and mexico are the united states two largest trading partners although far from perfect the agreement preserves most of the benefits provided by nafta the earlier three way trade agreement signed during the clinton administration and eliminates the uncertainty of a trade war with canada and mexico advertising however the future of trump s trade war with china which had been america s largest trading partner before the trade war began remains uncertain the so called phase one deal announced in december mostly just pauses the trade war keeping it at least temporarily from escalating while the agreement stops implementation of new trade restrictions it also retains most of the duties imposed since the start of the trade war with two thirds of all chinese imports facing duties that are six times higher than when trump took office furthermore the agreement could break down if china fails to purchase an additional above 2017 levels 33 billion in u s manufactured goods 12 5 billion in farm products 18 5 billion in natural gas and crude oil and 13 billion in services by the end of this year these targets were a stretch to start with but with the coronavirus epidemic creating a major slowdown in the chinese economy they almost certainly will not be met and the trade war could resume to make matters worse the president has signaled the start of a new trade war with the european union which includes three more top u s trading partners germany france and italy pushing for new trade agreements can be a tool to create a freer global trading environment but thus far all of trump s actions have taken the united states in the opposite direction ideally the united states would have duty and barrier free trade agreements with all of its trading partners but even in the absence of such agreements if the united states practiced free trade unilaterally we still would benefit economically that s why trump should declare victory in his trade wars take pride in the concessions he s received from other countries and unilaterally begin lowering u s trade barriers this would give a boost to u s based exporters and importers and encourage businesses that have been stymied by uncertainty to begin making new investments most voters understand little about the content or effects of trade agreements but they know how they feel the economy is doing if trump declared victory in his trade wars the vast majority of voters won t know or care much about the details but they ll have more confidence in the future of the economy and the president will get the credit in november
the election in 2018 of brazil s president jair bolsonaro has shown that south americans are pivoting away from socialism and towards free market economics this is a unique time in central and south american politics with many nations rotating away from china and russia towards the united states and other free market nations nations that show a healthy respect for property rights low taxes low regulatory policies and respect for intellectual property rights should be rewarded with free trade agreements that benefit both economies advertisement right now the united states is in a trade war with china with ongoing negotiations to resolve disputes over tariffs intellectual property theft and corporate subsidies there are large gulfs between the way the united states governs with a light touch regulatory scheme and the heavy handed chinese involvement in the economy it makes geopolitical and economic sense for the two biggest economic superpowers to engage in commerce yet these are nations trying to peacefully co exist with vastly differing economic models according to the office of u s trade representative the u s has free trade agreements with the south american nations of chile columbia and peru yet none with brazil according to the international monetary fund s world economic outlook database the united states has the largest gross domestic product gdp in the world the next highest in north central or south america is not canada 10 nor mexico 15 the next highest nation ranked in gdp in that region of the world is brazil 9 it is ironic that the two biggest economies in the americas are currently on the same page with economic policies yet with no free trade agreement with the recent shift under president bolsonaro towards free market capitalism and away from socialism it is time for president donald j trump to reward brazil s turn toward freedom with a free trade agreement advertisement recommended the election in brazil shifted influence away from china and russia and toward the west i wrote in townhall on october 9 2018 just before the workers party was tossed out of office the election in brazil may help determine if central and south america will move away from the corrupt socialist policies we see being promoted in venezuela and cuba toward free market oriented policies promoted by the likes of a candidate who is likely to be the next president of brazil with the trump of the tropics bolsonaro winning that election in brazil it is time for brazil and the united states to work closer together on military readiness and economic trade issues years of rule by the corrupt workers party put brazil in with a very low ranking in economic freedom in the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom brazil has a low growth rate and high unemployment thanks to 13 years of rule by the corrupt marxist workers party policies being implemented by the new government are showing progress towards more economic freedom brazilian leaders are saying all the right things on september 11 2019 brazil s minister of foreign affairs ernesto araujo identified the big challenge for civilization as not climate change but ideology araujo said that the new challenge is globalism with cultural marxism infiltrated in the institutions coming from a nation with an economy poisoned by years of marxist ideology stagnating the economy and allying with communist nations aruajo understands more clearly than most americans the need for freedom free markets and moral leadership in november of 2019 brazil s minister of economy paulo guedes came to the united states to make the case that brazil s dismantling of the socialist state constructed by the workers party is well under way guedes holds a phd in economics from the university of chicago advertisement there is one big obstruction to a free trade agreement with brazil protectionism by some in the trump administration oliver stuenkel wrote in foreign policy on december 6 2019 that recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have moved the relationship in the wrong direction stuenkel argued as the most pro american president in modern brazilian history bolsonaro has put establishing a strong alliance with the united states at the center of his foreign policy from the start early in the administration bolsonaro took a hard line against china and araujo lamented the influence of maoist china in south america guedes met with commerce secretary wilbur ross a few months ago in the hopes of better relations unfortunately the trump faction supporting hard line trade policies and protectionism beat out the pro freedom factions in the government who would support free trade agreements with strong u s allies like brazil it is time to abandon protectionist tariffs and reward president bolsonaro with a free trade agreement that will help bolsonaro secure his position as a pro american president in the largest nation in south america while benefitting the united states by having a large strong military and economic ally in south america
washington it s been three years of promises made and promises kept but we re just getting started insert state here that line from vice president mike pence is a hallmark of how he introduces president donald trump to campaign rally audiences last week he delivered versions at rallies in colorado springs and las vegas but is it true in some respects yes trump has followed through on promises to cut regulations and renegotiate trade deals and to donate his salary just to name a few but in many critical areas promises made by the president have not been promises kept a look at some areas where rhetoric has not matched reality economic growth the economy under trump will grow at a sustainable rate of at least 3 5 per cent and as high as 4 per cent the promise was part of the president s contract with the american voter that was released in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election and fed the story line that he would light a fire under an obama economy that republicans repeatedly categorized as sluggish what happened growth has largely followed the same trends of the obama era even after the stimulus from the 2017 tax cuts the nation s economy or gross domestic product grew at a rate of 2 4 per cent in the president s first year in office 2 9 per cent in 2018 and 2 3 per cent last year the gains mean the economy is improving just not as rapidly as what trump pledged to voters and that makes it difficult to build the political will to pay for his other stated initiatives such as fixing the nation s infrastructure federal debt when declaring his candidacy trump said he would reduce our 18 trillion in debt he later took those vows a step farther declaring that he would not just balance the budget but pay down the entire national debt what happened the opposite the u s budget deficit through the first four months of this budget year is up 19 from the same period a year ago putting the country on track to record its first 1 trillion deficit since 2012 the deficit reflected government spending that has grown 10 3 this budget year while revenues were up only 6 1 the deficit has gone up every year of trump s presidency the national debt now stands at more than 23 trillion the border wall when announcing his white house run on june 16 2015 trump declared i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall what happened mexico isn t paying the president has tried in multiple ways to demonstrate otherwise he has argued that the updated u s trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal but nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico he told supporters at a rally that redemption money is paying for the wall redemption payments don t exist trump apparently meant to cite remittances that refers to money that immigrants in the u s send to their countries of origin often to family members trump has at various times talked about taxing or blocking such money but that has not been done instead the president has diverted money from military construction projects and approved using counter drug spending to pay for wall construction the reliance on pentagon money continued anew this month when 3 8 billion previously authorized for f 35 fighter aircraft and other military programs was diverted to help build portions of the border wall taxes to make his proposed tax cuts more palatable to voters trump dangled the idea that tax rates would go up for the rich in may 2016 he told nbc for the wealthy i think frankly it is going to go up and you know what it really should go up what happened taxes on the rich went down not up in the vast majority of cases the top income tax rate fell from 39 6 to 37 as a result of the changes republicans made to the tax code the new cap on state and local tax deductions limited the benefits for some of the very rich but households earning more than 1 million saved on average more than 64 000 last year according to an analysis by congress joint committee on taxation people earning 50 000 to 100 000 got about a 1 000 cut from their income taxes
