last year we wrote our 2019 market outlook after u s equity averages suffered one of their worst fourth quarters in history our 2020 market outlook is being written as u s equities enjoy one of their best fourth quarters in history it is hard to be pessimistic about equities today the worldâ s major central banks have signaled every intention to support financial markets interest rates will not rise meaning that even at the lofty price levels of many u s stocks an argument can be made that valuations remain attractive historically coming off an exceptional year for equity gains in 2019 we can expect to see more yet modest gains again the following year entering the fourth year of the u s presidential cycle election year we can expect a solid stock market going back to 1950 markets have enjoyed 13 up election years and only 3 down election years with an average return of 6 6 finally geopolitical risks seem to be fading traders seem to have rejoiced that the u s china trade war is simmering down as donald trump removed additional tariffs set to go into effect in december in the u k the overwhelming reelection of boris johnson suggests that brexit will also finally be resolved one off geopolitical risks such as conflicts with iran in the middle east should be quickly digested by uninterested market participants as natural skeptics anytime we are presented with a â blue skiesâ scenario for equities we become concerned investment sentiment towards stocks is extremely high according to our wma market sentiment indicator the indicator reached 96 1 at the close of december the highest reading since july 2007 once all the good news is known by the public we have to ask who the marginal buyer will be to push equity prices higher we are also dubious on the concept of the never ending economic expansion no one expects a recession to hit in the foreseeable future markets apparently believe that the almighty federal reserve can stave off recession indefinitely we know that this is not the case the question is not if but when the current expansion will end while we can only foresee a garden variety recession quite unlike 2007 2009 stock prices should finally see some of the excesses of the past few years washed out i 2019 market review as we turn the calendar to a new decade financials markets experienced unequivocally the most exceptional 10 year stretch in history from world central banks extending crisis period monetary policy throughout an entire economic expansion to the rise to dominance of algorithmic high frequency trading to the longest and greatest percentage gain equity bull market in history no one could ever have imagined the events that would transpire since the financial crisis can we expect more of the same in the 2020s we have learned never to underestimate the willingness of central bankers and the governments to prop up financial markets while we have believed that educated economic leaders would not be so stupid as to create a bubble in financial assets we have been wrong kick the can down the road and hope that the accident doesnâ t occur on the current leadersâ watch perhaps we are too pessimistic and central bankers have found the remedy for recessions after 350 years of central banking or perhaps central bankers will be able to deflate assets prices in an orderly fashion as liquidity is withdrawn from the economy the day inflation becomes an issue again in any case the answer to the denouement of the â great monetary experimentâ will be known within this new decade our 2019 economic outlook written last december 2018 was in line with what played out over the past 12 months we noted that the ism pmis as well as the leading economic indicators were not giving impeding calls for recession we warned â speculating on the end of a late cycle economic expansion can leave your portfolio mis positioned should the expansion drag on â this is what has played out as the u s is now experiencing the longest expansion in history in terms of our 2019 equity market outlook written as equity markets were plunging last december with an inverted u s treasury yield curve we wrote that â higher interest rates in the u s and less accommodative monetary policies from major central banks will reduce liquidity on financial markets â as we now know the federal reserve did a 180 degree turn in monetary policy and instead of hiking rates twice the fed cut rates three times liquidity flooded back into markets and the stock market surged to its best yearly gain since 1997 we noted last december that emerging markets em and the s p 500 undergo long periods of relative outperform underperformance since 2011 the ems have underperformed the s p 500 buy 65 in the 1990s bull market the s p 500 blow away em in the tech bubble burst and 2002 2007 bull market it was em stocks that dominated we said that whenever the u s market tops out em markets are likely to begin a multi year period of out performance as shown in the 2019 relative price chart below em stocks underperformed by another 10 in 2019 as a top in the s p 500 remains elusive we also believed that the q4 2018 correction would mark a rotation from growth leadership to value leadership the correction turned into a massive buy the dip opportunity and growth resumed leadership although value has held steady since late summer as shown in the chart below as for sector allocation we were constructive on the late cycle plays in energy and basic materials most energy indexes finished the year lower while basic materials were close to market performers up 23 our bond market outlook was upended by the fedâ s 180 degree pivot on interest rate policy the u s 10 year t note finished 2019 at 1 87 a far cry lower than the 2 69 at the end of 2018 we were cautious on credit given the corporate debt bubble and the fedâ s policy tightening credit however bounced back with the barclays high yield bond etf jnk bouncing over 9 from the 2019 year end lows our big call in the bond market was to stay long emerging market local currency debt the was also the largest position in the dgr strategy throughout the year with a 20 weight this was not a bad call in terms of bond allocation as the total return on the emlc was nearly 10 in 2019 as we detail below we remain constructive on em local currency debt for 2020 in commodities we were very bullish on gold and silver at the start of 2019 we copy below the chart of the s p 500 philadelphia gold silver index used in our 2019 market outlook the red arrow marks the actual progression in 2019 of this relative curve we wrote looking at the s p 500 relative to the philadelphia gold silver index we see that precious metals are historically very cheap compared to stocks an allocation to gold and the gold miners also makes sense for 2019 as a hedge against a fed monetary policy error dollar weakness and late expansion inflationary pressures the philadelphia gold silver index finished 2019 up over 50 the s p 500 was up 29 finally in our 2019 currency market outlook we proclaimed to be dollar bears the fedâ s tightening cycle is well in advance of those of other world central banks the dollar index reflects this monetary policy lead for the dollar to continue to rise weâ ll need to see the fed carry through with at least two rate hikes in 2019 the u s economy perform better than expected and other developed nations have disappointing growth and foreign central banks carry on with their crisis level monetary policies this is too much to ask for we are dollar bears the dollar did rally with risk assets in january and continued a slow levitation until september as we close the year the dollar index will have fallen back to pretty much unchanged our bearish call on the dollar was premature but we donâ t expect the fed to reverse course again and begin raising rates which would further benefit dollar bulls ii macroeconomic outlook 2020 the u s economic expansion is entering its 11th year making this recovery which began in 2009 the all time longest on record like the phoenix rises from the ashes the u s economy exited the worst recession since the 1930s to enter the best or at least longest economic expansion in u s history like many we have been skeptical of the artificiality of the expansion which certainly would not have endured if it were not for central bank money printing and crisis period interest rates for most of the expansion we donâ t believe that permanent economic stimulus is the modern day cure for the business cycle one day excessive debt levels fiscal extravagance and artificially low interest rates will trigger another crisis it is not a question of â if â but â when â we do not have a crystal ball to reveal what might trigger the next crisis we can evaluate the strength of the economy and give our guesstimate as to the likelihood of recession on one hand going into a presidential election year the odds of a recession should be lower leaders tend to do everything in their power to stimulate the economy to increase chances for re election on the other hand we see softness in many traditional indicators that tend to be a precursor to recession we review these indicators here among the most reliable economic indicators include the ism pmis this survey data compiling the business sentiment of company leaders has had an excellent track record of corresponding to turns in the economy the ism manufacturing index has been in contraction territory below 50 0 for the past four months many optimistic economists are dismissing the ism pmiâ s weak readings as transitory attributable mainly to the u s china trade war we are not saying that this could not be the case in our chart below we count five mid cycle contractionary ism pmi readings since 1960 the other eight times that the ism pmi dipped below 50 for four months or more a recession ensued our chart also shows the ism non manufacturing pmi in red which remains in expansion everyone is well aware that the service side of the u s economy remains strong the services pmi has a shorter history from 1997 and has never given a false contractionary reading another traditionally reliable recession indicator is the yield curve these are lots of opinions as to whether the yield curve is a broken indicator thanks to 10 years of extreme interest rate manipulation by central banks we believe that it would be unwise to explain away historical market indicators due to central banks one could go so far as to explain away the risk of another recession or an equity bear market due to untraditional central bank policy actions the most watched treasury spread is the 10 year â 2 year this spread briefly inverted in last august sending a wave of panic through the markets but the immediate steepening of the curve in september released equities for the year end rally the only parallel we can see is the small inversion in june and july of 1998 the curve re steepened to above 50 bp before inverting again 18 months later and foreshadowing the 2001 recession some have been looking at the 30 year bond vs 3 month t bill yield spread while we can paint a rosier picture in terms of not being in a countdown to the next recession with the 10 2 spread this 30 year 3 month spread inverted significantly in 2019 just as we saw prior to the past four recessions if the messaging of the 30 year 3 month spread holds true we can expect the u s economy to enter recession in late 2020 or early 2021 the index of leading economic indicators lei slowed to essentially 0 on a year year basis in 2019 however we have seen the leis slow twice during this expansion only to re accelerate the slowing of the leis is rather exceptional this time given the one of the 10 components of the leis is the s p 500 itself a leading indicator of economic activity other forward looking variables in the index include items such as unemployment claims manufacturing shipments and orders housing starts interest rate spreads m2 money supply pmi indexes and consumer sentiment in other words with the s p 500 surging 30 this year the other 9 components were so weak that they more than offset the equity index to drag the leis lower we are not comfortable believing that equity traders are more correct on the economic outlook than the bond market and business outlook surveys we looked at the lead lag times from when the year on year change on the lei went negative and the date the nber declared the official beginning to a recession our findings are shown in the table below month recession began month leis turned negative lei lead lag december 2007 august 2006 16 months march 2001 november 2000 4 months july 1990 october 1989 9 months july 1981 july 1981 0 months january 1980 april 1979 9 months november 1973 november 1973 0 months december 1969 october 1969 2 months click to enlarge the november y y change on the leis was a tiny 0 09 in other words it wonâ t take much to push the year year change on the leis negative in our chart above we circled in red the two times since 1962 in which the leis went negative but a recession did not ensue further deterioration in the leis should be feared by market participants astute readers will recall that the s p 500 itself peaks on average about 9 months before the economy enters into recession to go a step further here are the historic lead times of the s p 500 peak versus the leis month s p 500 peaked month leis turned negative lei lead lag october 2007 august 2006 14 months march 2000 november 2000 8 months july 1990 october 1989 9 months january 1981 july 1981 6 months november 1980 april 1979 19 months january 1973 november 1973 11 months november 1968 october 1969 11 months click to enlarge for predicting the s p 500 top the leis are not as reliable nonetheless bear markets associated with recessions are much more severe in this sense bailing out of risk assets prior to seeing the leis go negative and indicate recession is speculative guess work on the employment front we now have the tightest labor markets in 50 years if you go by the unemployment rate now down to 3 5 unemployment may continue to hold at these low levels in 2020 but unemployment is the ultimate rear view mirror indicator sentiment numbers from consumers are tracking at historic highs even as the ism manufacturing the regional pmis show that business leaders are less optimistic again consumer sentiment tends to react to slowdowns with a lag after business sentiment surveys have already turned down consumer spending will be crucial to keep the economic expansion afloat so weâ ll be watching the consumers and retailer sales activity closely in 2020 as for u s gdp growth we project slowing growth in 2020 as election year fiscal policy stimulus wears off with the current economic expansion now the longest on record we believe that the expansion is living on borrowed time borrowed from years of central bank expansive monetary policy aside from the age of the expansion the yield curve inversions shown above concern us as does the contracting ism manufacturing index our gdp forecast in red is less optimistic than the consensus we expect u s gdp growth to dip negative by as early as q4 2020 in other developed markets we donâ t expect an economic re acceleration in japan or europe the international monetary fund imf has cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for japan from 0 9 to 0 8 with the economy set to decelerate to 0 5 in 2020 the imf projects that europeâ s growth will decline to 1 4 in 2019 from 2 3 in 2018 with a modest stabilization in 2020 with growth reaching 1 8 the second largest world economy is not expected to re accelerate in 2020 the imf is forecasting 6 2 gdp growth in china in 2019 and 6 0 in 2020 while china remains an emerging economy the transition to developed economy status is underway and the 10 annual gdp growth rates of the past will not be seen again iii bond yield forecasts the gap between central bank policies was reduced in 2019 as the federal reserve reversed course on its planned rate hikes to finally cut rates three times in 2019 u s japanese eurozone and u k policy rates began 2020 at 1 75 0 0 10 and 0 75 respectively in our 2019 market outlook we wrote our forecast for fed rate hikes is simple we have seen the last rate hike in this cycle the next fed funds move will be a rate cutâ we believe the central bankers and economic policymakers will soon realize that negative rates will have quite uncertain and likely harmful effects on the economy while we are hopeful that the era of negative interest rates will be relegated to the now prior decade the crisis period interest rates that financial markets have gotten used to are here to stay the reasons are simple first central banks have blown asset bubbles in equities and sovereign credit in their effort to pull the world economy out of the financial crisis if interest rates double equities would become so over valued that a severe and disorderly sell off would occur another financial crisis second to save the world from the sovereign debt crisis world economic leaders added even more debt into the system we could write a treatise on all the areas with inordinate levels of debt from u s student loan debt to corporate debt as companies took advantage of artificially low interest rates to leverage up including borrowing to pay dividends and buy back shares and we wonâ t even touch on the u s federal debt level a ticking time bomb that neither the president nor congress whichever party is in control wants to address interest rates cannot rise for the simple reason that all the current outstanding debt cannot be serviced at higher interest rates central bankers are well aware of this interest rates will be manipulated lower as far as we can see welcome to market driven free financial markets developed market bonds seem still very expensive but we guess this is part of the new normal the reality is that bond yields donâ t pay enough interest for pension funds anymore and equity yield will be sought after for long term retirement funds we still see a role for sovereign developed debt in our portfolios as a hedge against the next equity correction as money always has to go somewhere we would expect bonds to be the place to hide whenever the excesses in stock market are worked off but holding on to developed market bonds after equities correct assuming another crisis is not in store for 2020 should prove to be a drag on portfolio returns the u s 10 year t note is yielding 1 91 to start 2020 this compares to a 1 75 dividend yield on the s p 500 after a 30 rally on the s p 500 we can only be at worst neutral on the t note to start 2020 should yields fall t notes rally and we again see the 10 year yield well below the s p 500 dividend yield our neutral t note stance will move back to bearish note that in our charts we have set prices to a base 100 starting in january 2009 allowing readers to quickly see the asset performance over the entire economic expansion for example with the t notes above the total return has been about 46 last year we recommended that investors avoid credit we wrote â twelve years ago consumers refinanced home mortgages and borrowed against the rising value of their properties to buy big ticket items now it is corporations using cheap debt and the one time trump tax cut windfall to take cash from balance sheets to pay shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks the cash outs have driven corporate debt to record levels â our assessment has not changed according to federal reserve data outstanding debt by corporate sector hit 15 5 trillion at the end of q3 2019 or as a percent of real gdp 74 last year we highlighted the chart below and were concerned with total corporate debt at 51 of gdp as mentioned above the debt problem is getting out of control we therefore would not chase yield in corporate paper in 2020 the iboxx investment grade corporate bond etf lqd and the barclays high yield bond etf look excessively dangerous in light of the corporate debt bubble the one area of the bond market that we like is emerging market debt and more specifically local currency debt as we explain in our equity outlook section below long term investors should be rotating out of over valued u s financial assets and into relatively cheap emerging market assets we like em local currency debt for two reasons first the 6 4 average yield on em sovereign debt em debt brings more volatility but in a low yield world this is the trade off investors must accept second em currencies are generally at cycle lows versus the u s dollar dollar based investors can use em local currency bonds to gain exposure to these undervalued currencies even without adding physical real pesos or baht to your portfolio iv currency market outlook we have a strong preference for undervalued currencies going into 2020 the huge rally in the u s dollar has accompanied a record run in the u s stock market capital inflows into the u s require buying u s dollars which likely explains recent dollar strength is the u s dollar a fundamentally strong currency we are not sure given the obscene federal debt level and clear manipulation of the market by the u s central bank it will probably take outflows from u s financial assets to sink the dollar but this may be a self fulfilling prophecy the stronger the dollar the most penalized u s multinational foreign earnings will be at some point dollar strength will be bad enough for u s multinationals that earnings will get hit stock prices will fall and foreign dollar investments will be repatriated our guess is that dollar strength is getting long in the tooth among our 2020 currency allocation choices we like the commodity currencies the canadian dollar australian dollar and south african rand tend to appreciate with stronger commodity prices we also like that the central banks of these countries have not been experimenting with negative interest rates our preference remains for emerging market currencies which have underperformed with other em assets during most of the expansion which began in 2009 underperformance in most of the em currencies is only tangentially related to poor country economic fundamentals or political risks u s assets along with the dollar are in a bubble and assets on the other side of this trade namely em currencies must be falling the brazilian real is still trading near cycle lows although we see a horizontal basing process which could prove to be a launchpad for brl appreciation the turkish lira has suffered through the countryâ s geopolitical woes but the economy is not as weak as the lira chart suggests while not too eager to buy lira buying turkish stocks is a good way to gain lira exposure while buying cheap companies v commodities markets perspectives we have written at length about the commodity trade see â the commodity super cycleâ in sum our arguments are as follows commodities oil and metals prices should be at their sweet spot in the late economic cycle inflation tends to pick up as the economy begins to overheat and commodity prices tend to be one of the best inflation hedges relative underperformance of hard assets compared to stocks has reached a 20 year extreme the pendulum will swing back in the direction of hard assets just as we have observed throughout history commodity stocks are unloved and underowned the weight of energy within the s p 500 is below 5 an all time low when sentiment gets this sour its best to be contrarian oil price weakness does not change our thinking as the drop in crude oil does not reflect fundamentals but rather 1 excessive speculation over a global economic slowdown and 2 a rapid unwinding of long crude short nat gas trades put on by large hedge funds we trust opec will manage supply to keep oil prices at stable levels higher than levels prevailing today as for global oil demand this mostly depends on the economy of china and the monetary policies of the peopleâ s bank of china commodity investors should be particularly attentive to a chinese economy hard or soft landing the attempted rebound in crude oil in 2018 was erased in the fourth quarter rout since early 2019 crude oil has not been able to find a new direction we believe the risk for oil prices is to the upside in 2020 gold and silver prices have been very strong even as the risk on trade is in full swing we believe there are two reasons why precious metals could continue moving higher in 2020 first traders will be hedging against an accident in risk asset prices as the u s equity rally has gone too far to end easily second central banks keep debasing their currencies through quantitative easing programs and negative interest rates gold is serving its role as a store of value we remain bullish on the metals and miners although we donâ t expect much linearity in the price uptrend vi final thoughts for 2020 we believe that 2020 will follow the pattern described in our equity outlook section and resemble the equity trade of 2016 or 2018 there will be plenty of political risk as the u s presidential election unfolds markets will have to deal with two candidates donald trump and the democrat primary winner who will bring almost polar opposite programs from how to deal with china trade to corporate regulation to taxing the wealthy the uncertainty and severity of the two presidential outcomes will necessarily bring volatility to the markets especially if polling shows a tight race the new year may also be challenging or rather frustrating for those who have gotten too comfortable sitting in passive index fund products a focus on downside protection will be required including relying on a manager selecting the best companies and not blindly following capitalization weighted equity indexes lower our focus in 2020 will be on high quality earnings while not over paying for that quality solid balance sheets while avoiding firms whose current valuations have gotten too far above the companyâ s historic norms

overview without fresh escalation investors cannot maintain a heightened sense of geopolitical anxiety the recovery of us shares yesterday set the tone for today s rebound in asia and europe all the equity markets in the asia pacific region rallied today led by a 1 6 rally in japan and a nearly 1 4 advance in australia with the exception of taiwan europe is also recouping much of what was lost over the past two sessions and us shares are trading firmly bond yields have not risen as much as one might expect core bond yields are little changed while european peripheral yields are around two basis points higher and uk gilts are also under pressure the dollar is trading higher against nearly all the major currencies with the antipodean currencies the heaviest among emerging market currencies asia is faring best with the chinese yuan the strongest currency in the world today rising a little more than 0 5 against the us dollar at the same time eastern and central european currencies underperform the combination is leaving the jp morgan emerging market currency index little changed gold s seven day rally under threat but after a drop to about 1555 it has recovered 10 to trade little changed on the day similarly february wti recovered from its initial pullback to hover a little below 63 a barrel asia pacific the setback in the yen yesterday helped set the stage for the recovery in japanese stocks today japan s 10 year bond auction was well received with a little concession offered by the initial rise in yields the sale was oversubscribed 3 7x the most since august recent reports suggest foreign central banks have also bought jgbs and hedged back into dollars to secure a larger yield than available in the us treasury market the mof will report the latest portfolio flows thursday morning in tokyo but at the end of last year foreign investors were net sellers of jpy1 33 trillion of japanese bonds the selling offset the bulk of the four week buying spree that was snapped it was the largest divestment since september if year end window dressing was the culprit a return to the market may not be surprising if not in this week s report then next week s while china s reserves draw attention that does not seem to be the main development today china s reserves rose to 3 107 trillion in december from 3 096 trillion in november the increase appears to reflect valuation adjustments rather than intervention reserves stood at 3 073 trillion at the end of 2018 and have been virtually flat in the last several months still we think the bigger story that has not received much attention yet is the comment from china s vice minister of agriculture that cautioned that the country will not boost its annual grain import quotas to accommodate the higher farm purchases from the us wheat corn and rice were specified though not soy there are two implications first it seems like meeting the numerical targets the us has touted will be more difficult and second that the increase in us agriculture exports to china will come at the expense of other countries after recovering yesterday from almost jpy107 75 to the jpy108 50 area the us dollar is consolidating in about a quarter yen range below jpy108 50 this area corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of the greenback s decline from the december 26 high the 200 day moving average is near jpy108 65 and the next retracement objective is around jpy108 70 the australian dollar is extending its downdraft for the fifth consecutive session and its loss of over 0 75 today could be the biggest decline since last april recall that the leg up had begun in late november from around 0 6750 and peaked on new year s eve near 0 7030 the dramatic correction has brought seen it retracement 50 0 6895 which also corresponds to the 200 day moving average it appears set to test the next retracement target closer to 0 6860 the chinese yuan firmed above its 200 day moving average cny6 9490 for the first time since last may europe two data points from the eurozone are important today first the preliminary december cpi rose 0 3 as economists expected this lifts the year over year rate from 1 0 to 1 3 the core rate was unchanged at 1 3 service inflation eased slightly to 1 80 from 1 85 while core goods prices rose 0 45 a two year high from 0 37 in november we anticipate a further rise in emu inflation as a result of the base effect and higher oil prices the core rate may rise a bit more and around 1 5 would begin to spur a change in tone from the ecb the second data point was the november retail sales report it rose by 1 0 compared with the median forecast in the bloomberg survey for a 0 7 gain plus october s 0 6 decline was revised to only 0 3 the resilience of eurozone retail sales which is domestic demand and dovetails with the relative strength of the service sector picked up on the pmi is impressive with the tory majority in the house of commons the brexit bills are expected to easily be approved before the house of lords vote on the measures on thursday this seems like simply a formality at this juncture separately chancellor of the exchequer javid s office has confirmed the budget will be presented on march 11 the government intends to jettison the fiscal rules so that the uk can take advantage of the low interest rates to boost spending the euro is weaker but is trading within yesterday s range initial support is seen in the 1 1155 1 1160 area a break could spur another half cent loss resistance now is pegged near 1 1190 sterling built on yesterday s recovery but ran out of steam after poking above 1 3200 support is seen near the recent lows near 1 3155 1 3165 there is an option for about gbp220 mln at 1 3155 that expires today america the us reports november trade and factory goods orders today and the non manufacturing ism that will help shape q4 gdp forecasts as we noted the atlanta fed s gdp tracker is looking at a strong quarter with above trend growth while the ny fed s model has the us economy slowing to a little more than 1 at an annualized rate investors know from the preliminary goods balance that the trade deficit fell in november they know from the 2 0 decline in initial durable goods orders that factory orders likely fell as well today s data barring a significant surprise is unlikely to clarify the picture that may have to wait until the employment data at the end of the week canada reports its merchandise trade balance november and a wider shortfall is expected the ivey survey jumped in november to 60 from 48 2 and the december reading likely slipped back the us dollar remains pinned near its recent trough against the canadian dollar we like the us dollar higher and a move above cad1 3000 would suggest it has begun but it may take a move through cad1 3040 to be convincing similarly the us dollar has not been able to distance itself from the mxn18 80 area that has been the floor since the end of last year here too we like the greenback on technical grounds the dollar index is slightly firmer within yesterday s range a move and ideally a close above 97 00 would lift the tone it has not closed above there since boxing day lastly we note that the s p 500 posted an outside up day by trading on both sides of the previous session s range and closing above its high this is seen as a bullish development that projects to new record highs however the lack of follow through today would be disappointing
as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash
this year marks the 25th year since joe slovo passed way at the time of his death on 6 january 1995 slovo was the sacp national chairperson having previously served as our general secretary he was a long standing member of our central committee and its politburo he was a member of the national executive and working committees of the anc and was serving as the first minister of housing a great theoretician strategist and tactician of our struggle for liberation and social emancipation slovo was also a man of practical action his development of theory strategy and tactics was anchored in practice he was a founding commander of our liberation army umkhonto wesizwe the mk along with nelson mandela his last responsibility in the mk was as chief of staff he was succeeded by chris hani in both this position and that of the general secretary of our party the sacp advertisement slovo was involved in the drafting of all major documents that defined our vision theory and practice of struggle against apartheid beginning with the freedom charter adopted by the congress of the people in 1955 the other historic documents include the popular sacp programme adopted underground in 1962 the road to south african freedom and the widely embraced first strategy and tactics document of the anc adopted in 1969 in morogoro tanzania slovo s major works became influential these include the south african working class and the national democratic revolution which he produced in 1988 the significance of slovo s intervention in 1988 remains as relevant as ever more so in this period where as the sacp we are pursuing a programme to build popular left and widest possible patriotic fronts and to work together with our allies to deepen the strategic relevance of the anc headed alliance in theory as well as in practice some of the negative tendencies that slovo examined and cautioned against in his intervention still exist our task is to overcome them and forge wider working class and broader revolutionary unity these include a tendency he described as workerist which sought to divorce the working class from our national liberation movement and expunge the essence of the national democratic revolution slovo had the following to say about the tendency especially its disruption of unity in favour of separatism and therefore disunity advertisement a transitional stage of struggle involving inter class alliances is alleged to lead to an abandonment of socialist perspectives and to a surrender of working class leadership the economic struggles between workers and bosses at the point of production which inevitably spill over into the broader political arena is claimed to be the class struggle this is sometimes coupled with a view that the trade union movement is the main political representative of the working class our broad movement is also facing difficulties from within it is precisely during this time that communists must deepen their role in the broad movement hence the focus of our special national congress held in december 2019 that we must rebuild our movement yes rebuilding our movement means paying particular attention to the anc but most importantly to our revolutionary movement as a whole not least attaching great importance to the working class the main motive force of the national democratic revolution the most direct route to socialism in our historical conditions that is the vanguard role of the sacp that of pointing the way forward rather than being the chief mourner and lamenter about the problems facing the movement that is what joe slovo stood for the sacp strongly condemns imperialist united states aggression and attacks in the middle east we are remembering slovo at a time when the united states government is once again embarking on dangerous acts of provocation and threatening war in the middle east the sacp strongly condemns the acts of aggression by the united states against both iranian and iraqi people these attacks amount to a violation of the two countries rights to national sovereignty and self determination the flagrant violation of iraq s sovereign airspace is one of the many examples which prove that the imperialist regime of the us has never cared about the freedom of the people in any region or country and is prepared to violate international law whenever it wants to it is a well documented fact that the us involvement in the middle east has nothing to do with peace for the people in that region neither does it have anything to do with the promotion of international peace and security like in venezuela the us intention in the middle east is to achieve control of natural resources particularly oil as well as its global market and the promotion of the us dollar in the middle east in the year 2000 for instance iraq decided to use the euro for its oil exports but since the illegal military invasion of iraq by the us in 2003 and the occupation that followed iraq was coerced back to the us dollar it is also no mystery why iran with 10 per cent of the world s oil production would attract the imperialist us violence the surrounding of the region with us military bases has all the imperialist trappings against which the working class must unite this is our call as part of its strategy of geo political hegemony the us also acts to change the balance of forces in the middle east in favour of its ally the apartheid zionist state of israel all peace loving people need to also strongly condemn the habit of all us presidents to assert their authority through foreign aggression and particularly trump s attempt to divert attention from his impeachment process by spilling blood in the middle east the sacp calls for an intensification of internationalist work from the working class and upon all peace loving people globally to wage a relentless struggle against imperialism the world s working class movement must unite in defence of the peace loving and democratic people of iraq iran and the broader middle east the sacp is calling for an end to military escalation militarisation of the middle east and imperialist occupation in the region and elsewhere the sacp further calls upon the iranian authorities too to uphold the human and democratic rights of the people of iran these include political rights including the right to free democratic political expression let us celebrate our national achievements and unite to tackle our societal challenges this year april will mark the 26th anniversary of our victory over the apartheid regime in april 1994 we stand tall today in our commemoration of slovo in view of the massive social progress we have made benefiting millions of our people starting with our enshrinement of the bill of rights in our country s constitution since 1994 we have massively expanded access to housing electricity clean drinking water health care and built clinics and roads in communities that were previously marginalised we have massively expanded access to education all levels to alleviate poverty we have placed millions of people on social grants it is a historical fact that life in south africa is better now than before our victory over the apartheid regime in 1994 this is not just a national reality it is also an international reality south africa is an attractive destination to people from other countries where conditions are comparatively far more difficult however unresolved contradictions and increasing challenges are undermining our achievements in particular we are severely affected by the legacy of colonialism and apartheid coupled with factors such as bad governance poor oversight state capture and other forms of corruption in a world dominated by the imperialist agenda of neoliberalism and global capitalist crisis lack of successful national development planning failures to complete infrastructure and other development projects in time and a lack of proper quality control also undermine the massive progress we have made since 1994 if he were alive slovo would for instance certainly be unhappy about load shedding poor quality or dilapidating rdp houses and skyrocketing cost overruns in development projects moreover the crisis of social reproduction caused by systemic inequality structural unemployment and entrenched poverty has plunged many families and communities into distress simply put the crisis of social reproduction refers to the intense difficulty that has crippled the ability of many families to make ends meet as if that were not enough gender based violence underpinned by both the economic crisis of capitalism and the historical legacy of patriarchy has become entrenched this is a patriarchy that was sharpened and anchored into the capitalist system and its structures of the economic exploitation of labour by capital it is a patriarchy behind the high levels of gendered inequality unemployment poverty violence and social insecurity the sacp is calling for maximum unity of south africans to overcome the vicious impact of the crisis of social reproduction patriarchy and gender based violence and to confront state capture and other forms of corruption to this end the working class as the main motive force of our revolution has a crucial role to play one of our key objectives this year is precisely to rebuild our movement inclusive of the anc and to move the national democratic revolution our national transformation and development programme into a second more radical phase our aim is to advance and defend the democratic transition and deepen the advance to socialism we call upon the progressive trade union movement starting with our ally cosatu to convene an all embracing national summit this year the objective of the consultative conference should be to discuss the conditions of the workers come up with a joint programme of action and put co operation into practice unity will not fall from the sky it has to be worked for and forged from the ground in the common interests of the workers the joint progressive trade union movement campaign should include a dedicated focus on achieving a turnaround of state owned enterprises soes and other public entities the sacp will support the programme of action by deepening its efforts to forge popular left and patriotic fronts and through direct participation and working with our allies to achieve reconfiguration united worker actions trade union and broader unity are important also to defeat both state capture and neoliberal networks down with neoliberalism and state capture networks in south africa post 1994 aspirant capitalist strata capitalist without capital from within the ranks of the formerly oppressed acquired a degree of hegemony through the language of black economic empowerment bee two varieties of primitive accumulation were driven in the state on behalf of these emergent capitalist aspirants the first generation was the narrow bee accumulation strata which were an inherent part of the 1996 gear class project in this version of primitive accumulation state power was used to regulate legally established corporations procurement by the state was used as a policy instrument to enforce bee share holding quotas established monopoly capital with varying degrees of moaning played along with this narrow bee primitive accumulation seeing it as a better way of managing change without having to substantially change the new bee elite were quickly absorbed usually as passive and junior partners into the life styles of the established capitalist class the ethos of primitive accumulation filtered all the way down to grassroots with petty accumulation for micro entrepreneurs steadily from the mid 1990s organisational machinery shifted from popular struggle to a narrow electoralism and then in a further debasement to winning elections in order to occupy office with the primary intention of reproducing and expanding primitive accumulation the first generation narrow bee was largely played out within the rules of the capitalist system in general while non market forces were used state regulatory power the empowerment followed the rules narrow bee beneficiaries received indebted shares and were expected to repay the loans generally established monopoly capital played along with and often actively promoted this agenda seeing it as a key means to advance its interests by deepening capitalism in south africa against radical threats however for many reasons this agenda proved unstable and unleashed many contradictions and rivalries including within state institutions not all aspirant capitalist strata could be accommodated within the 1996 gear class project s inner bee circle enter the looting class the second generation of the post 1994 primitive accumulation what we loosely described as state capture is a second wave of accumulation using positions within the state and politics but this second wave no longer played within the parameters of a capitalist rule of law it involved direct looting expropriation of public resources and particularly of key soes and other public entities aided and abetted by gangster lumpen capitalists bourgeoisie the new dangerous class moreover it was no longer in the interests of capital or monopoly capital in general quite the opposite while for the state capture networks looting the likes of eskom and transnet into near death experiences is their core business established capital and the broader south africa community not least the working class and the poor require functioning mostly low cost mainly publicly supplied energy and logistics systems the sacp has used the term state capture and even played a leading role in popularising it while clearly understanding that it was a short hand term for popular use we have also sometimes preferred to speak of corporate capture in general or regarding the state corporate state capture or corporate capture of the state state capture has caused enormous damage to economic infrastructure the finances of state owned enterprises soes other state owned entities and broadly the south african economy it further weakened our capacity as a country to face the increasingly hostile global economic environment due to the compromised nature of some of our instruments for economic transformation and development like the soes and key institutions such as the south african revenue services sars neither state capture nor the neoliberal agenda our fight against the corporate state capture networks was in no way intended to make way for a re assertion of the neoliberal agenda and its policy regime similarly our fight against the neoliberal agenda and its policy regime is in no way intended to give any quarter to the parasitic networks associated with state capture to rebound and resume looting the choice between looters and neoliberals is no choice at all the advocates of the neoliberal agenda use public power and the policy making space to facilitate and legitimise the transfer of productive state resources to exploitation by private wealth accumulation interests while the state capture parasites use public power but follow crude smash and grab or outright high jacking tactics to achieve the same results what is the way forward a people s economy and a democratic development state the necessity for south africa is to establish a people s economy and a democratic developmental state in other words without the national democratic revolution being reflected in economic policy not only will we fail to resolve the immanent capitalist crisis we find ourselves in we will also inevitably move towards a more complex and prolonged crisis the unfolding crisis of capitalism which is global but has specific features in south africa based on our historical conditions is certainly generating more crises these systemic crises are not only economic they are also social political and ecological rather than a piecemeal approach and a narrow focus on the effects without paying attention and going to the root of the problem what our country needs is a comprehensive approach radical structural transformation this must build expand diversify and raise the levels of national production benefit the majority of the people and reverse the catastrophic tide of climate change the national democratic revolution must pursue new ways of production and forge alternative patterns of consumption to protect the environment from degradation if we do not future generations fauna and flora will not survive in our environment already our country and many areas in southern africa and other parts of our continent and the world are experiencing the worst drought ever recorded there is an increase in the number of natural disasters as a result of climate change the average temperatures increase year by year globally australia one of the world s relatively developed countries was on fire this week major cities were affected certain areas in some small towns have been burned to the ground these are not the acts of god but a direct result of capitalists not caring about anything other than immediate profit the main cause of the problem is the capitalist mode of production appropriation of wealth and patterns of consumption but part of our struggle to protect our environment must include intensifying educational and ideological work against climate change denialism it was deeply disturbing yesterday when one of our tv stations was giving a platform to a climate change denialist yes we will defend freedom of the press but please do not take us back to denialism whether aids or climate change denialism it is absolutely important to also take into account the fact that in our country the colonial character of the capitalist economic foundations including its legacy of apartheid remains unresolved despite having defeated the apartheid regime in 1994 the hard reality that we are faced with 25 years after the democratic breakthrough is that economic control still decisively rests with the old order capitalist economic ruling class it is a capitalist order whose fundamental character is as a subordinate and semi peripheral component of the imperialist global economy it was partly for this reason that narrow bee located deeply in this economic framework could only serve a minority even with the best intentions to make it broad based interestingly the first anc strategy and tactics document warned against this our nationalism must not be confused with chauvinism or narrow nationalism of a previous epoch it must not be confused with the classical drive by an elitist group among the oppressed people to gain ascendancy so that they can replace the oppressor in the exploitation of the mass the anc morogoro strategy and tactics document was embraced by the entire alliance during the time of the most intense struggle against oppression the document called for the liberation of the oppressed to extend beyond mere formal political control and encompass the element which makes such control meaningful economic emancipation this historical mission remains essential to the completion of the liberation of south africa the working class must unite and pursue it rigorously to this end we must strengthen and play our vanguard role as the sacp those who have abandoned the course of liberation for which countless revolutionaries ordinary south africans and people in the surrounding countries sacrificed have embarked on a path of narrow nationalism others have branded themselves as champions of radical economic transformation when all they have become are radical looters or advocates of neoliberalism it is in this context that privatisation outsourcing and tenderisation that is division of the functions and roles of the state into tenders even where it is unnecessary were used as the policy instruments of narrow bee narrow nationalism and state capture associated looting what we need is to move our economy on to a new and qualitatively different growth path that places the needs of the people at the centre of everything we must improve the conditions of the workers in this regard the pursuit of the decent work agenda is important in the present period we must push policies that will create productive work for the unemployed to make a living and lead a decent life however while the importance of being employed cannot be overemphasised compared to being unemployed the reality in our country is that merely being employed does not automatically lift one out of poverty and inequality this is why millions of workers primarily because of labour exploitation by capital remain poor despite being employed we therefore must push policies with a focus dedicated to lifting people out of poverty through work systematically reducing inequality and tackling economic exploitation on this basis and arising out of our special national congress held in december 2019 we put forward and pledge to push the following democratic developmental programmes financial sector transformation financial sector transformation including low cost banking and financial services this also requires systematic elimination of financial exploitation a publicly controlled developmental banking and financial sector a co operatively owned banking and financial sector strict regulation and management of the capital account among others to protect our economy against volatility and stem the tide against illicit capital flows prescribed assets for productive and developmental purpose a sovereign wealth fund to support national development by increasing the levels of public investment among others in economic and social infrastructure such as roads rail telecommunication clean drinking water and sewage infrastructure renewable and cleaner energy production integrated communities sports and arts facilities broader economic transformation a high impact comprehensive industrial policy including digital industrial and innovation strategies aimed at developing our domestic productive capacity and creating decent work a comprehensive socio economic policy approach and therefore a development oriented poverty eradication strategy with emphasis on support for productive activities and sustainable livelihoods revitalisation of the publicly owned sector of our economy in particular but not exclusively a turnaround of our soes and adequate support for the whole sector to grow and thrive our special national congress resolutely rejected privatisation of soes our objective this year and going forward is to firmly advance this rejection into practical action soes must be under state led democratic control on behalf of the people as a whole combating state capture and other forms of corruption in the public sector as well as across the economy on an intensified basis our objective this year is to drive this fight to the finish what we want to see are real results including evidence led prosecution asset forfeiture and long term prison sentences for the perpetrators acceleration of land redistribution and support for productive land use especially for the poor and the working class we call upon parliament to complete the process of amending section 25 of the constitution to make land expropriation without compensation categorical in the interest of advancing productive land use and ending land hunger in our country land and agrarian reform with focus on but not exclusively women and youth empowerment as well as rural development as part of our strategy to act against global warming a drive to plant millions of trees across the country a stimulus package focusing on developing our domestic productive capacity and turning around our economy review of the fiscal policy framework to boost state revenue to support industrialisation and development this should include the introduction of a wealth tax a state owned pharmaceutical company overall macro economic policy framework alignment in line with the commitment made by the alliance in the anc may 2019 general election manifesto overall alignment of our macro economy policy framework including the above and aimed at supporting the objectives of the second radical phase of our democratic transition the other commitments made in the manifesto and the measures that follow expansion of the mandate of the south african reserve bank to explicitly target maximum sustainable employment and an explicit balanced and sustainable inclusive high growth target sustainable livelihoods and social protection adequate social protection including social grants that are sensitive to inflation pressures and responsive to the already existing economic and social reproduction crises an economic empowerment programme directly linked to production development support for the broad masses including a targeted focus on fostering worker ownership and a thriving co operatives sector promulgation of a local economic development eco system as an integral part of social protection and sustainable development transformation of the public and community works programmes to make them the employer of last resort on the basis of the decent work agenda and a training space for the unskilled forging ahead with the introduction of the national health insurance to ensure quality health care for all especially the poor and working people international solidarity slovo gained his first fighting experience as an internationalist long before the founding of the mk in the second world war against the forces of adolf hitler and fascism we take this opportunity in memory of slovo to congratulate the zimbabwe communist party for holding its first congress in december 2019 we pledge our revolutionary solidarity with the people of swaziland in their struggle for democracy we call on morocco to unconditionally end its occupation of western sahara and pledge our revolutionary solidarity with the saharawi people in their struggle for self determination we congratulate the sudanese people for their overthrow of omar al bashir and pledge our support for their struggle for democracy we strongly condemn the apartheid regime of israel for its human rights violations in palestine and pledge our revolutionary solidarity with the palestinian people we congratulate the people of cuba for the milestone of the 61st anniversary of the 1 january 1959 cuban revolution we condemn the imperialist regime of the united states for its blockade of cuba and history of atrocities in cuba latin america and the rest of the world we call upon the united states to unconditionally end its illegal blockade of cuba occupation of cuban territory of guantanamo bay and aggression and destabilisation in latin america broadly in particular we pledge our solidarity with the people of cuba nicaragua venezuela and chile among others who have continued to suffer the us imperialist offensive we strongly condemn the racist right wing and imperialist backed coup in bolivia and pledge our solidarity with resistance led by president evo morales

in the coming year u s investors will have to shift tracks as they adjust to a different set of risks and opportunities many of the concerns relating to the trade war with china and uncertainty over brexit have diminished but new ones have surfaced globalization is no longer about just economics but also about national security and human rights and it could take a 180 degree turn potentially hurting emerging economies investors have in recent years experienced buoyant stock markets especially in the u s as central banks persisted with expanding liquidity but the liquidity spigot could be turned off as central banks step back increasing volatility and making stock picking more challenging investors would then gravitate away from passive index investing to more actively manage their portfolios mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz listed those and other factors as the key imponderables for investors in the year ahead in a discussion with wharton finance professor jeremy siegel on wharton business radio s behind the markets show on sirius xm el erian was recently named a senior global fellow at the joseph h lauder institute of management and international

the u s to continue its economic expansion in 2020 the 12th year after the last recession citing a healthy labor market among other factors however fears of a recession and uncertainty over the u s

also to a strong start to the christmas season and a good consumer sentiment report as harbingers of gdp growth above 2 he predicted that corporate earnings would increase 5 in 2020 adding that a lot depends on the u s economy and foreign economies but also exchange rates between the dollar and the euro and other currencies the u s economy is fine said el erian you cannot get a recession with the household sector so strong the u s market on a stand alone basis is in a good place he added the problem is the rest of the world i have been against the view that investors should fade the u s markets in favor of the rest of the world el erian continued i ve been saying stick with the u s stick with the u s but at some point over the medium term the uncertainties from the rest of the world i fear are going to have an impact for the market less for the economy and more for the market the u s economy is fine the problem is the rest of the world mohamed el erian why europe lags el erian pointed to the latest sign of trouble in europe reports that germany s industrial output saw a 5 3 year over year drop in october to log its biggest downturn since 2009 the divergence between the u s and europe in economic growth is related mainly and not entirely to three factors he noted one is that the u s has had some pro growth policies whether you agree that they were efficient and fair most economists agree that deregulation and the tax cuts that took effect last year in the u s have produced a short term growth boost he noted europe has done very little if anything to promote economic growth policy wise and that relates to politics secondly the u s economy is doing better because it is less open than europe el erian continued so has been less vulnerable to the spillover from the u s china trade war europe is very open to trade and has taken the hit hard thirdly the u s is just inherently more dynamic in terms of economic activities he said put these three things together and the u s continues to outperform the rest of the world both for internal reasons and because it s less exposed to external vulnerabilities is a rebound in sight siegel pointed to buzz that a turnaround might be underway in some stock markets elsewhere in the world for instance european stocks have done well recently they don t have the record of u s stocks he added there have been some tentative signs that maybe germany had bottomed he added at the same time as concerns persisted over brexit he wondered if the so called recovery was a little false turnaround and if europe would continue to see a deepening slump a few days after the wharton business daily interview boris johnson led the conservative party to a landslide win in the u k with a promise to get brexit done and lowering some of the concerns around it el erian read the early signs of an uptick in europe as the beginning of an l shaped recovery instead of the v shaped recovery that some experts have visualized 1 or below being stall speed the slowest speed a plane can fly to maintain level flight you re not going fast enough to overcome a lot of the structural and debt weaknesses that are embedded in different countries in the eurozone he said he worried that an l shaped recovery might make the likelihood of a recession in europe higher europe s growth challenges schwartz wondered if the european commercial bank s policy of negative interest rates could stimulate the economy the ecb s negative interest rate policy requires financial institutions to pay interest for parking excess reserves with the central bank which should prompt them to boost lending to businesses and consumers as a reuters article noted the ecb is in a lose lose lose situation said el erian we have crossed a line between negative interest rates having a beneficial impact and now we talk about collateral damage and unintended consequences these negative rates undermine economic activity in several ways the major reason for the big decline in interest rates even negative interest rates is really not central bank policy but fundamental demographic factors jeremy siegel one outcome of the negative rates is an increase in german savings said el erian rather than stimulate consumption what s happening is very cautious german savers who are targeting a certain terminal income level are simply saving more because they re not getting paid on their savings two he saw excessive risk taking in some sectors of the financial system three we re seeing zombie companies continue to operate he said noting that they are pressuring down productivity growth zombie companies typically exit a competitive market are typically connected to weak banks congest markets and constrain the growth of more productive firms according to an ecb research paper four i worry that we re going to find that there has been a misallocation of resources market based economies don t function well in a prolonged period of negative rates i think that the eurozone is discovering this el erian explained why he called it a lose lose lose case for the ecb getting out is not an option because if they were to raise interest rates right now it would cause financial market disruptions and that in itself could spill back doing more is not going to help either so what are the options what we need is a policy hand off from excessive reliance on unconventional policies by central banks to a more comprehensive pro growth policy approach said el erian it s a political implementation issue and the politics in germany right now suggest that we are just going to continue hoping for a policy response but it s not going to happen meanwhile europe s reliance on negative interest rates may be coming to an end if it takes a cue from sweden on december 18 sweden s central bank riksbank dropped its policy of negative interest rates and raised its key rate to zero from minus 0 25 el erian said in a tweet that other central banks should follow the lead set by riksbank among the positive signals the riksbank cited were the election outcome in the u k which has eliminated of the risk that the u k might exit the eu without a deal and signs of a thawing in u s china trade relations the major reason for the big decline in interest rates even negative interest rates is really not the central bank policy but fundamental demographic factors said siegel he pointed to the continued intervention of central banks with quantitative easing which spurred demand for high quality assets which in turn depressed interest rates to zero all of us are falling into the low interest rate world he said noting that it is difficult get out of it unless it results in sufficient economic growth the risk is that you succeed in promoting asset prices and you don t succeed in promoting economic activity to the same extent said el erian the result of that scenario is the likelihood of volatility unless fundamentals improve quickly in the rest of the world to validate where asset prices are today we are going to have more liquidity induced volatility u s investors have done well in recent years with passive index investing but may now switch to more active investing el erian noted this is living the dream for investors high returns no volatility and correlations that favor you even though it doesn t make sense that both risk free and risky assets go up he said that is the period we ve come from and it has been a very good period for passive index investing i m not sure we can extrapolate that for the next five years unless fundamentals improve quickly in the rest of the world to validate where asset prices are today we are going to have more liquidity induced volatility mohamed el erian navigating uncertainties ahead el erian pointed to major uncertainties facing investors in the year ahead one is over the pace of globalization i don t know whether we have just pressed the pause button on globalization and that we re simply going to press play again and the world will continue to globalize economically and financially on better footing he said and by better footing i mean not just a fair trade but a fairer trade that remains free another view out there is that the world might de globalize because it s not just about economics anymore it s also about national security he added el erian said he has been very pro american markets and cautioned investors against re allocating their funds away from the u s towards emerging markets generally picking certain spots in emerging markets that i m ok with he said but general exposure to emerging markets vis a vis the u s i say not yet he pointed to one big danger if we press pause on globalization emerging markets are the most vulnerable segment of the marketplace the risk of de globalization is a major headwind for emerging markets it can actually derail the more vulnerable of them trade issues with china continue to be a big factor and a durable solution to the trade conflict is harder to achieve especially because the issues are not just economic but also involve national security and human rights the u s has weaponized tariffs as a means of getting to a fairer trade system el erian noted and wondered if more countries might resort to similar actions any country a company or even a household needs three attributes to navigate uncertainties el erian said you need resilience you need the options to be able to update your information set and your probabilities of potential outcomes using scenario analyses and then you need agility and the ability to move quickly for companies those attributes translate into a solid balance sheet position cash generation a solid business model and good management said el erian adding that those are the most likely to reward investors the volatility he expected in the markets would allow investors to find pick those stocks cheaply his advice for investors maintain your structural and secular inclinations and positions in the portfolio but you have somewhat more of a tactical or opportunistic side to it and you slowly evolve your portfolio from what has worked very well which is general market exposure to making it somewhat more focused and more targeted as the opportunities arise he said those opportunities could be found in not just value stocks which trade at lower prices relative to their fundamentals such as earnings and dividends but also elsewhere
88 billion is the estimated liabilities for state and local governments over the next 30 years on infrastructure pensions and climate change we explore three broad options to pay these liabilities increase government revenues reduce government spending and grow the economy hawai i is in a deep financial pit projects to mitigate climate change improve infrastructure and meet public employee pension and retiree health care obligations are expected to cost the state and four county governments over 88 billion over the next 30 years according to a report called troubled waters charting a new fiscal course for hawaii produced for the hawai i executive conference that cost exceeds hawai i s 2018 real gdp of 80 8 billion and is five times larger than the state government s operating and capital improvements program budgets for fiscal year 2019 2020 we need to sound the alarm says keli i akina president and ceo of the grassroot institute of hawaii the situation is critical but not hopeless says carl bonham executive director of uh s economic research organization and an economics professor at uh mānoa he was a contributor to the report and says these problems are solvable and the state is already taking steps to address many of the issues outlined in the report for example the state has agreed to gradually pay off its unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities which are expected to cost 25 billion over the next 30 years in addition state and county governments address some of their infrastructure needs every year and some projects mentioned in the report already have federal or state funding sources there s no room for backsliding he says and the key is to act sooner rather than later we re in this situation because we didn t address many of these issues five years ago 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago so the discouraging part if you will is that we ve known about climate change for quite a while we ve known about the needed infrastructure investment and we ve chosen year after year not to maintain various pieces of infrastructure not to invest in it he says it s hard to get a straight answer on how exactly to pay for these expenditures contributors to the troubled waters report and other experts emphasize that finding solutions will require conversations and collaborations with stakeholders but generally there are three options increase government revenues reduce government spending and grow the economy those are political choices and society has to be able to weigh in on that and clearly in today s world the community has to buy into it bonham says adding that people need to be willing to make trade offs and those trade offs need to be equitable and need to be spread across society and not just borne by one group usually the poorest among us here s how much state and local governments are expected to spend on projects to mitigate climate change improve infrastructure and meet public employee pension and retiree health care obligations over the next 30 years hawai i s next challenges the 88 billion figure in the troubled waters report includes 15 3 billion to prepare for the impacts of climate change and natural disasters 47 2 billion to improve critical public infrastructure and 25 7 billion to meet the state s pension and retiree health benefits obligations the goal of the report was to provide a framework for the next set of challenges that hawai i will face and ignite a process for the best and brightest in government the community and the private sector to discuss how to address them says jeff laupola project lead for the report and a real estate private equity intern at tradewind capital group he adds that the 88 billion figure used in the report is a conservative number estimates by government agencies were taken at face value and individual items had to surpass 100 million to be included in addition some government agencies may not have determined all of their future needs at the time the report was created sterling higa one of the report s principal authors adds that newer reports on climate change mitigation efforts have since been published and may add to the 88 billion state rep sylvia luke chair of the state house finance committee says the report makes it seem like the state needs a one time cash payment of 88 billion but that s not true for example the legislature appropriated 350 million in 2019 for the redevelopment of aloha stadium and the honolulu rail will be partially funded using federal dollars both projects were included as liabilities in the report including the 1 55 billion the federal government has committed to the rail they look at all these various funding as just one time cash payment and so when you simplify an issue like that then it kind of misleads the public that the amount that we need right now is 88 billion in cash which is really not true she says tom yamachika president of the tax foundation of hawaii and a report contributor emphasizes that paying for the state s investments is not a matter of bringing in more revenues instead it s about reprioritizing what government does i m reminded of a quote that s attributed to steve jobs of apple he says i believe the situation was they were at a product development meeting he was at the whiteboard he was writing down a bunch of ideas that were being thrown around and he said hey that s great we have 10 good ideas we have resources for three so what three are we going to be developing in state government it s like the 10 good ideas come up let s fund all 10 decision makers he says need to start telling people no unfortunately sacrifice is not easy and change is not easy says state sen donovan dela cruz chair of the senate ways and means committee and i don t believe that the state has done a good job at articulating the consequences of not making these decisions and so that s something that we re going to have to work on there s no silver bullet to pay for these future liabilities he adds it s not just going to be just fees and taxes it s not just going to be investments in certain industries it s not just going to be public private partnerships he says it has to be a macro approach that s going to be integrated that s going to be strategic and that s going to include a lot of different parties it s too much to put on one department or even just a couple of departments here are some potential ways to fund hawai i s future liabilities what about raising taxes there s disagreement about whether taxes should be raised to help pay for hawai i s future liabilities several experts interviewed for this story agree that raising taxes would be risky because people are already leaving the state as a result of the high cost of living and tax burden keli i akina president of the grassroot institute of hawai i argues that taxes should be lowered hawai i has the nation s greatest sales tax burden which means compared to residents of other states a greater proportion of island residents personal incomes are going toward sales taxes he says hawai i also has the highest estate tax in the country and that several taxes have been raised recently examples include a higher surcharge tax on rental cars and increased property tax rates for hotels and homes valued over 1 million in honolulu reducing taxes he says tells businesses and new residents that hawai i is a place where businesses and individuals can thrive the general excise tax is a common target for proposed tax increases carl bonham executive director of uh s economic research organization and professor of economics at uh mānoa says raising the general excise tax would make the most sense from an efficiency standpoint because it also applies to the state s nearly 10 million visitors the excise tax rate is relatively small compared to some states sales taxes on kaua i hawai i island and o ahu the rate is 4 5 and in maui county the rate is 4 revenue from the 0 5 surcharge on kaua i and o ahu is used for transportation infrastructure bonham adds that the state has enough infrastructure needs for the surcharges to continue permanently hawai i already invests in its infrastructure every year but more funds are needed to address long term maintenance and new needs related to climate change he says however he acknowledges this tax can be regressive because lower income people spend a higher percentage of their income on it than middle class and affluent people state rep sylvia luke says she supports tax policy that is fair and equitable where all segments of an industry are taxed taxing real estate investment trusts would be a fair tax policy she says because the trusts are currently sheltered from paying corporate income taxes while other local real estate businesses are not when we re talking about billions of dollars of revenue that is needed tinkering with a few taxes here and there is not going to do the trick she says in order to address all these problems and have it fully funded then you actually are talking about a substantial number amount of taxes that we need to raise 1 reform the public pension and retiree benefits systems public employees expect to receive their pensions and retiree health care benefits when they retire but in 2018 the state s pension system was only 55 funded and the health benefits system was 16 funded if paid now in a lump sum it would cost hawai i 25 7 billion to fully fund these two systems and be able to pay for future retirement benefits already incurred for existing employees the aloha state is gradually paying off these unfunded liabilities through annual contributions while fully funding the two systems has perks like better credit ratings that lead to lower borrowing costs for government and reduced contributions that taxpayers would have to pay in the future it also means tying up more of the state s limited general funds leaving less money now for other programs like public education safety and health and social services in fiscal year 2020 2021 contributions to the state pension and retiree health benefits systems to cover the costs of benefits already earned and pay down the unfunded liabilities and other fixed costs like medicaid payments and debt service will make up about 51 of the state s general fund expenditures to help mitigate future pension costs the state introduced a new tier of reduced pension benefits for employees hired after june 30 2012 thomas williams executive director of the state employees retirement system which manages the state pension system and serves 135 000 members says those newer employees are required to work longer in order to vest their benefits have reduced annual automatic cost of living increases added to their pension payments have higher employee contribution rates and cannot use overtime in their retirement benefit calculations wes machida former state budget and finance director and former ers executive director says savings from establishing this second tier of benefits plus other reforms like increasing the amount of money that public employers have to contribute toward the pension each year is expected to save billions of dollars williams adds that the new tier represents about a third of ers membership and about 8 of its total liabilities and potential savings could be impacted by employment rates and turnover payroll growth inflation longevity retirement rates and investment return assumptions among other things changes have also been made to the state employer union health benefits trust fund which provides health and life insurance benefits to state and county employees and retirees and their dependents public employers help pay for benefits for both retirees and their dependents if the retiree became a member of the state retirement system before july 1 2001 for those who became members after that date employers only contribute toward retirees benefits luke says the state has made significant strides to cut costs but the challenge is that some of the savings won t be realized until after those newer employees retire which could be decades from now one of the things that we are doing is this is really about looking out for the future generation and we need to make those tough choices now so that our kids and our grandkids won t be saddled with some of the decisions that we make today she says several people interviewed for this story agree that further retirement benefit reforms are needed making changes however is not simple the state constitution protects benefits that have already been accrued so changes to benefits can only apply to new hires it s going to take a while for the effect of any pension reform or benefit reform to kick in but we still got to do it yamachika says williams says one potential pension change includes reducing or suspending annual cost of living increases when adverse events increase the unfunded liability this is one way other states have addressed their unfunded pension liabilities he says he adds that while prior earned benefits are protected by the constitution it s believed that benefits attributable to future service can be modified even for current employees though this view has not been tested in hawai i courts another potential option he says is to prohibit the use of overtime in future retirement calculations for employees hired before july 1 2012 this would eliminate the practice of pension spiking where employees work a lot of overtime in an attempt to increase their pensions machida adds that employers are already required to pay for pension spiking from their budgets this was mandated several years ago to encourage employers to manage overtime and other pay more effectively williams says the legislature establishes the parameters of the retirement benefit plan and none of the possible changes he mentioned are now part of a legislative proposal we are constantly looking at alternative responses to reduce and mitigate our unfunded liability he says but it s like having a menu of options and there can be one or more combinations that achieve the desired financial impact and that s a subject of negotiations with the legislature and the employer and employee groups derek mizuno administrator of the eutf wrote in an email that the eutf board of trustees is addressing its long term liabilities in several ways the board puts out a request for proposals every few years for health and life insurance providers and third party administrators this helps to ensure that it s getting the best prices for retiree premiums he wrote in addition benefit plans are designed to maximize other insurance and subsidies like medicare and encourage healthy and beneficial behaviors through the provision of diabetes prevention and supportive care pilot programs and the removal of copayments for annual exams and advance care planning visits while the state has a plan that puts it on track to fully fund its pension and health care obligations within 30 years machida cautions that the plan is based on numerous assumptions such as how long people will live if those assumptions prove incorrect it will change the state s retirement costs akina of the grassroot institute argues the pension system should be replaced with a defined contribution plan where benefits would be provided based on retirement fund contributions rather than years of service and salary that s how 401 k plans work however some people including williams argue that such a transition would be more costly the defined contribution plan would add an additional administrative cost because the state would still be obligated to honor existing benefits for those who choose to remain with the defined benefit plan and would still need to pay off the unfunded liability says beth giesting director of the hawai i budget policy center an affiliate of the hawai i appleseed center for law and economic justice if there is ever a benefit in having a defined contribution plan it is so many years in the future that nobody has even looked at whether it s a good thing she says colbert mastsumoto who served on the ers board of trustees from 2000 to 2017 and was a principal author of the troubled waters report adds that it might be an option to look at after 2043 when the pension is fully funded giesting says hawai i should continue to pay off as much of the unfunded liabilities as it can because it lessens future costs for taxpayers but the state doesn t need to fully fund its pension funding the pension at a lower level she says would give the state flexibility to do other things like prepare for the next recession or fund other critical programs williams says retirement benefits support citizens in their golden years and the overall economy retirees supported by pensions tend to not need public aid he says and if the pension were eliminated it would be a huge financial and societal mistake randy perreira executive director of the 42 000 member hawai i government employees association and president of the hawai i state afl cio adds that hawai i s pension plan is one of the best in the country and helps government compete for employees frankly the way we view it the pension plan is the benefit that government employees get for being paid far less than their private sector counterparts over a 30 40 year career he says is declaring bankruptcy an option the united states code does not allow states to declare bankruptcy says tom yamachika president of the tax foundation of hawaii municipalities however can declare bankruptcy detroit for example declared bankruptcy in 2013 after facing billions of dollars of debt and ended up reducing its pension and health care benefits despite michigan having a constitutional provision similar to hawai i s that protects accrued retirement benefits in a 2018 paper published by the congressional research service kevin lewis a legislative attorney wrote that bankruptcy courts presiding over municipal bankruptcies like those in detroit and stockton california have agreed that municipalities can reduce their pension debt in bankruptcy many municipalities however have opted to leave their pensions intact bankruptcy for the state is an unlikely option several people interviewed for this story say because hawai i s situation is nowhere near that dire 2 form public private partnerships sherry menor mcnamara president and ceo of the chamber of commerce hawaii says the troubled waters report highlights the need for businesses to work more collaboratively with government we need to start talking with each other and finding out what can we do to solve some of these challenges now because we are at a crossroads she says several people interviewed for this story agree that government should partner more with the private sector to complete some of its critical projects some plans are in the works to use public private partnerships or p3s for the last segment of the honolulu rail and to redevelop aloha stadium into a new commercial district with a smaller stadium jill jamieson is the managing director of real estate services firm jll and author of a report commissioned by the ulupono initiative that looked at finance and delivery options for the honolulu rail project she defines a p3 as a broad range of medium to long term contracts to design build finance operate and or maintain public purpose infrastructure the last part is key to her definition she says a p3 is a procurement tool for delivering an infrastructure project that a government would otherwise do itself in addition some risk such as financial or scheduling is transferred from the public sector to the private partner one of the challenges with getting people on board with using this tool she says is that a p3 is not well defined in hawai i andrew robbins executive director and ceo of the honolulu authority for rapid transportation says any type of contracting between government and a private company could essentially be considered a public private partnership but what p3 infrastructure projects have in common is some private financing p3s he adds can also be used on social infrastructure projects such as the building of hospitals student housing and convention centers hart and the city and county of honolulu are jointly soliciting proposals to design build finance operate and maintain the final 4 1 miles of the rail from kalihi to ala moana center construction work is estimated to cost around 1 4 billion robbins says this delivery model provides greater certainty regarding the cost to taxpayers and the schedule because the private partner will finance the construction this means that while they re constructing the project we don t pay them full value of the work they re doing he says they have to finance a portion of it themselves and only after the project is completed and the train is actually up and running according to the performance standards in the contract do we the government public sector start to pay back the private finance that way he says the private partner has a powerful incentive to finish the project on time and on budget the 20 mile 21 station rail project has faced ballooning costs amid years of construction delays the project which is being funded by the general excise tax transient accommodations tax and federal funds is now expected to cost about 8 16 billion hart and the county anticipate that the contract to design build finance operate and maintain the final segment of the rail project will be awarded in february and construction is expected to begin in september the entire rail system is forecast to be operating by december 2025 akina cautions that p3s need to be structured carefully to ensure there s benefits for the public and private entities and taxpayers a good public private partnership he says is one in which the business entity not the taxpayer takes some of the financial risk so the business is incentivized to ensure construction and ongoing operations are profitable where that s not done the taxpayer is often left holding the bag for the liabilities of a failed project he says we can learn a lot about this by looking at the rail project robbins says there s great interest in p3s in hawai i and many eyes are on the rail to see how the public private partnership plays out perreira of the hgea anticipates that p3s will be used for transit oriented development along the rail line too it can work but it s not the answer in all situations he says and it shouldn t be viewed as the end all solution to government revenue issues 3 grow the economy bonham the economist says hawai i needs a sociopolitical consensus that it will do everything it can to have sustainable equitable economic growth and that growth he says needs to be reasonably strong not what we think is likely to happen over the next three or four years which is very anemic growth he says there s a huge difference in our ability to cover these expenses if we re growing it 2 or 2 5 instead of 1 one way to accomplish this is to improve the regulatory environment for businesses bonham says entrepreneurs should be able to create and expand businesses without facing obstacles at every turn gladys quinto marrone ceo of the building industry association of hawaii wrote in an email that the long time needed to obtain permits and other approvals is a significant barrier to construction businesses it s not just one regulation she wrote it s a cumulative effect from multiple government agencies imposing their own regulations death by a thousand cuts hideo simon co owner of square barrels restaurant and pint jigger says he struggled to navigate the complex permitting process to open his restaurants in downtown honolulu both of which required renovations to spaces in existing buildings renovations for square barrels included changing the gas cooking equipment moving the dish pit and adding walls any changes required approvals by several government offices including the permitting fire wastewater and sanitation departments the problem that i think for somebody like me or small businesses in general is that we re trying to create something from scratch and we re trying to be energetic and enthusiastic about our craft and what happens is we get thrown into this big matrix of regulation and have to figure out how do we guide ourselves through this labyrinth and try to get to where we re trying to be he says so like from the time that i signed the lease until the time i opened it was approximately nine months the biggest risk in dealing with the time consuming and expensive process before you actually open the business he says is that rent utilities and employee costs still need to be paid when there s no income coming in he plans to open another restaurant in kaimukī in 2020 and says he s expecting the permitting process for renovations to again take a long time more education and good communication from government agencies can help he says especially in understanding what regulations need to be followed and what steps small businesses can take to save money bonham says government agencies need to be familiar enough with business models and industries so they can analyze whether regulations can be improved without putting things like the environment health or safety at risk that needs to be the attitude or the whole approach he says yes we got to make sure we protect the environment but we also need to try and make sure we re not creating years of red tape or high cost burden and if that becomes the attitude of every line agency that s interacting with businesses then i think we re making steps towards having a business environment that is more conducive in addition he says hawai i needs more policies that facilitate investment in businesses and industries one successful example is the hawai i growth initiative a state equity investment program that was launched in 2011 by the hawaii strategic development corp a 2016 uh economic research organization report found the initiative successfully catalyzed the development of an innovation economy by helping to launch companies entrepreneurial programs and coworking spaces in the islands the report estimated that for every dollar invested into the program by the state local innovation companies received 11 49 in funding yamachika adds that some people in hawai i mistakenly believe that business is evil and that mentality has to be worked on businesses he says need to show people that they re trying to help there s got to be i think a deeper understanding that needs to be forged between the business community and government to address some of these very real problems we have he says and i think the hawai i executive conference s report is a very important first step to at least start identifying what we have to look at and then maybe using that as a catalyst to get people together to start talking about it

the nicaraguan government s violent repression against demonstrators protesting its brutal neoliberal policies resulting in more than 300 people being killed by regime forces since april 2018 is only one of the reasons why various leftist social movements have condemned the nicaraguan regime led by president daniel ortega and vice president rosario murillo the left has many more reasons to denounce the policies of the regime to understand this we must go back to 1979 that year saw the victory of an authentic revolution in nicaragua that combined a popular uprising self organization of cities and neighborhoods in rebellion and the action of the sandinista national liberation front frente sandinista de liberación nacional fsln a political military organization inspired by a marxist guevarist castroist model the revolution put an end to the 42 year authoritarian rule of the somoza dynasty which had appropriated the state its armed forces administration and significant parts of its economic assets and established a strong alliance with the united states the somoza dictatorship proved to be an effective bulwark against progressive political forces multinationals could maintain and increase their plundering of nicaragua s national resources in exchange for commissions that added to the increasingly important wealth of the ruling family the fsln was founded in the 1960s as a leftist group opposing the government mainly through guerrilla warfare it was not until some of its guerrillas took high ranking members of the nicaraguan ruling classes as hostages in december 1974 that it was considered a potentially serious threat to the dictatorship after the spectacular action of the sandinista guerrillas the regime declared a state of emergency increased its repressive grip over nicaraguan society and hunted down the fsln earlier that year liberal factions of the bourgeoisie opposing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the somoza ruling clique had already formed the democratic union of liberation unión democrática de liberación udel under the leadership of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal editor of the liberal newspaper la prensa they hoped to gather political momentum and force the regime to liberalize the fsln eventually split into three factions the prolonged people s war faction remained committed to the strategy of accumulating forces in remote areas until they would have enough strength to liberate entire regions of the country and launch a final assault against somoza s army the proletarian tendency emerged to challenge the prolonged people s war strategy considering it inadequate given the absence of a permanent occupying army they argued that since the rural populations would not directly witness the imperialist endeavor they would not join the guerrillas in massive numbers furthermore the development of capitalist production in the country with the economic development of the 1950s and 1960s had given rise to an agricultural and industrial proletariat constituting respectively 40 and 10 of the active population by 1978 the proletarian tendency therefore focused on organizing mass working class organizations in urban areas gaining the support of industrial workers with the perspective of launching a swift insurrection when the conditions to do so would be met finally the terceristas whose main figures included daniel ortega and his brother humberto also advocated an insurrectional strategy but were open to tactical alliances with the liberal factions of the bourgeoisie opposing somoza while the proletarian tendency stressed the need for a mass uprising and self organization the terceristas displayed substitutionist tendencies that implied an armed insurrection led by organized guerrillas but without a simultaneous mass uprising would be sufficient to overthrow the regime and take power eventually the regime lifted the state of emergency in 1977 thinking that the guerrilla movement was defeated and the conditions for entering negotiations with the liberal opposition were ripe but fsln factions were prompt to resume their armed actions in urban areas in january 1978 the murder of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal by regime soldiers was caught on video it sparked tremendous anger among the liberal opposition as well as among the population a general strike supported by the liberal bourgeoisie was launched while fsln groups staged armed actions against somoza s national guard in august another general strike was called sandinista guerrillas staged an assault against the national palace where a joint session of both chambers of the parliament was taking place taking hundreds hostage this resulted in the liberation of several political prisoners from somoza s jails more importantly spontaneous uprisings took place against the regime enabling the left to gain momentum over the liberal opposition after the fsln called for insurrection several urban uprisings errupted in september 1978 while these were decisively defeated by the national guard this scared the liberal opposition whose representatives sought to enter negotiations with the regime that were to be mediated by the u s dominated organization of american states oas the terceristas denounced this turn of events and withdrew from the front they had helped to build with the liberal opposition in january 1979 somoza turned down the proposals of the liberal opposition the momentum was then with the sandinistas who reunited and created the following month the new patriotic national front frente patriótico nacional fpn in which they were the politically dominant force as the fsln prepared to launch a broad military offensive they called for a general strike in june as mass urban uprisings occurred the armed insurrection quickly moved in to liberate areas of the country one after the other somoza s army disintegrated when the army stronghold in the capital was finally liberated on july 19 1979 its remnants had no choice but to flee in particular to neighboring honduras in the new fpn government the revolutionary political forces pledged to install a democratic regime guarantee a non alignment of nicaragua s foreign policy thus putting an end to the alliance with the united states and develop a mixed economy the development of cooperatives and state owned enterprises would be encouraged while the existence of private capital would not be fundamentally threatened as long as it was perceived as patriotic that is loyal to the sandinista revolution rather than to the overthrown somoza regime or u s imperialism during the next two years several developments illustrated how different nicaragua was from other cases in which the left had come to power through elections in latin america these included chile in 1970 venezuela in 1998 1999 brazil in 2002 2003 bolivia in 2005 2006 and ecuador in 2006 2007 due to the destruction of anastasio somoza s army and the flight of the dictator the fsln not only assumed governmental power but also replaced the somocista military with a new army that was put at the service of the people it also took control over the banks and decreed a public monopoly on foreign trade over the 1980s major social progress was made in the areas of health care education improving housing conditions even if they remained rudimentary fuller rights to organize and protest as well as access to credit for small producers thanks to nationalization of the banking system these represented undeniable progress but the fsln government was forced to fight a decade long war against counterrevolutionary forces known as the contras who were heavily supported by the united states unable to satisfy its ambition of direct military intervention washington settled for a low intensity conflict that would strangle nicaragua economically and isolate the fsln politically u s imperialism and its vassals such as the regime of carlos andrès perez in venezuela and regional dictatorships as in honduras that served as the contras staging base found it necessary to contain the spreading of this extraordinary experiment in social liberation and renewal of national dignity in fact social revolt was rampant in the region in particular in el salvador and guatemala where revolutionary forces close to the sandinistas had been active for decades however in 1990 the fsln lost the general election to the right with violeta chamorro the widow of pedro joaquín chamorro cardenal elected president under chamorro nicaragua was to fully embrace the neoliberal austerity promoted by the washington consensus by the end of the decade nicaragua became the second poorest country in the americas after haiti assessing the sandinista experience in the 1990s as a result of disappointed hopes there were those who posited that what was needed was to try to change society without taking power unfortunately it is not possible to change society unless people take power at the level of the state the question is rather how to build an authentic democracy that is power exercised directly by the people for the purpose of emancipation in nicaragua it was necessary to overthrow the somoza dictatorship through the combined action of a popular uprising and the intervention of a political military organization as such the victory of july 1979 remains a popular triumph worthy of celebration without the ingenuity and tenacity of the people during the struggle the fsln would not have succeeded in striking the decisive blow against the somoza dictatorship several questions arise did the fsln go too far in the changes it made in the society did it take the wrong direction or are the disappointing subsequent developments the result of aggression by north american imperialism and its allies in nicaragua and elsewhere in the region in fact the fsln leadership did not go far enough in its radicalization first the fsln leadership did not go far enough in implementing radical measures to support segments of the population who were the most exploited and oppressed beginning with the poor rural population but also with underpaid factory health care and education workers it made too many concessions to agrarian and urban capitalists second the fsln with its slogan national directorate give us your orders did not provide sufficient support to self organization and worker control it placed limits that were highly detrimental to the revolutionary process of course responsibility for the outbreak of the war lies exclusively with the enemies of the sandinista government which had no choice but to confront the aggression nevertheless errors were made in the means of waging the war humberto ortega the head of the army formed a regular army equipped with expensive heavy tanks unsuitable against the guerrilla methods of the contras further the mandatory conscription of the country s youth was unpopular this combined with the errors made in the area of agrarian reform had damaging consequences in a recent interview henry ruiz one of the nine members of the national leadership in the 1980s pointed out the campesinos were not favored on the contrary they were affected by the war the war waged by the contra and the war waged by us agrarian reform was seriously insufficient and the contras took full advantage of that fact much more land should have been distributed to rural families giving them title to the property instead the sandinista leadership nationalized the major somoza estates but spared major capitalist groups and powerful families whom certain sandinista leaders wanted to turn into allies or fellow travelers compounding this error the fsln wanted to quickly create a state agrarian sector and cooperatives to replace the large somozist estates priority should have been given to small and medium private farms distributing property titles and providing material and technical aid to the new campesino owners additionally priority should have been given to support production for the domestic market improving and increasing the domestic and regional market would have made maximum use of organic agriculture methods on the one hand the leadership of the fsln made too many concessions to bourgeois forces who were considered allies and on the other hand engaged in excessive statism or artificial cooperativism the result was not long in coming a part of the population disappointed by the decisions of the sandinista government was attracted to the contras the latter had the intelligence to adopt a discourse aimed at the disillusioned campesinos telling them that they would help them overthrow the fsln this would then result in a fair distribution of land and agrarian reform it was deceitful propaganda but widely believed in the countryside certain people within the sandinista movement conducted surveys on the ground and alerted the leadership to what was happening these included work coordinated by orlando nuñez who remained loyal to ortega despite his initial left wing stance work done by others independent of the government and related to liberation theology came to the same conclusions a number of rural organizations linked to sandinism unag atc etc were also aware of the problems but engaged in self censorship internationalist experts specializing in the rural world also sounded the alarm concessions were made to local big capital wrongly perceived as being patriotic and an ally of the people wage increases were limited and the bosses recieved fiscal incentives in the form of lower taxation such an alliance should have been rejected at each important stage criticism from within and outside of the fsln emerged the magazine envío for instance was founded in 1981 as a publication that provided critical support to nicaragua s revolutionary process from the perspective of liberation theology s option for the poor but such criticism was not taken into account by the leadership which was more and more dominated by daniel ortega his brother humberto and víctor tirado lópez all three supported the tercerista faction which did not have a full understanding of the necessity of self organization and was inclined to alliances with the bourgeoisie they were joined by tomas borge and bayardo arce of the prolonged people s war faction further the four other members of the national leadership did not form a bloc to oppose the continuation and deepening of the errors it is important to point out that proposals for alternative policies were formulated both inside and outside the fsln constructive critical voices did not wait for the 1990 electoral failure to propose new directions but they received only a limited hearing and remained relatively isolated illegitimate and odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts the leadership of the fsln should also have questioned repayment of the public debt inherited from the somoza dictatorship and broken with the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates and the international monetary fund imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries as a dependent country aligned with the united states somoza s nicaragua received a massive amount of foreign lending in the 1970s in addition to multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the imf there were several international private bank lenders while the loans were officially for development they were used to strengthen the authoritarian regime and increase the wealth of somoza and his clique after the latter left the country with most of their assets the new sandinista government was in dire need of funding in order to implement progressive policies and encourage industrialization somoza s debt would soon impede the implementation of such policies when the fsln took power the foreign debt stood at 1 5 billion by 1981 its servicing represented 28 of the country s export revenue admittedly it would not have been easy for the government of a country like nicaragua to face its creditors alone but it could have begun questioning the legitimacy of the debts from the very institutions that had financed the dictatorship the sandinista government could have launched an audit of these debts by calling for citizen participation and could have gained support by the broad international movement around the demand that the debts be abolished agreeing to repay the debt meant defending the interests of the nicaraguan bourgeoisie who had invested in the debt issued by somoza and borrowed from u s banks for the sandinista government repayment also avoided confrontation with the world bank and the imf even with the government s efforts to maintain collaboration these institutions decided to suspend their financial relations demonstrating how useless it was to make the concessions yet after the external debt reached seven billion dollars the fsln government implemented a structural adjustment structural adjustment economic policies imposed by the imf in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans structural adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the imf and the world bank the requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt structural adjustment usually combines the following elements devaluation of the national currency in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies rise in interest rates in order to attract international capital reduction of public expenditure streamlining of public services staff reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector etc massive privatisations reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products freezing of salaries to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation these saps have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries they have simultaneously led to higher prices because of a high vat rate and of the free market prices and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services among other factors imf plan that degraded the conditions of the poor without affecting the rich the plan introduced in 1988 resembled the usual conditions imposed by the imf and world bank even while these institutions had still not resumed financial relations the fsln government policies were leading the revolutionary process straight into a wall this resulted in the right s victory in the february 1990 election in short the government maintained an economic orientation that was compatible with the interests of nicaragua s wealthy bourgeoisie and major private foreign corporations it was an export oriented economy based on low wages in order to remain competitive on the world market what prevented the revolution from advancing was the failure to put people at the core of the transition that followed the overthrow of the somoza dictatorship not overly radical policies but this was not doomed to happen the government should have paid more attention to the needs and aspirations of the people in rural as well as urban areas to break away from the export oriented extractivist model that depends on competitiveness on the international market the sandinistas could have gone against the interests of the capitalists that still dominated extractivist industry they could have done more to gradually implement protectionist policies in favor of the small and medium sized producers who supplied the domestic market and limited imports this would not have required peasants and small and medium enterprises to sacrifice for the international market instead of encouraging the masses to follow orders given from the top of the fsln self organization by citizens could have been promoted at all levels with citizens given control over the public administration as well as over the accounts of private companies the political institutions developed under the fsln government were not fundamentally different from those of a parliamentary democracy with a strong presidency this structure could not and did not provide the basis for a counter power when the right was elected in 1990 refusal to stand up to creditors that demand repayment of an illegitimate debt is generally the beginning of the abandonment of the program of change if the burden of illegitimate debt is not denounced people are condemned to bear that burden we stress the issue of illegitimate debt because should the oppressive regime of daniel ortega and rosario murillo be replaced it would be essential for a popular government to call into question debt repayment should the right take leadership in the overthrow of the regime we can be certain that it will not call the debt into question in 1989 the fsln government reached an agreement with the contras that put an end to fighting which was of course a positive development yet it was a pyrrhic victory when the sandinista leadership called a general election in february 1990 it felt certain it would win having just negotatied a peace agreement they expected to reap 70 of the votes in the elections they were flabbergasted by their loss the result struck the sandinista leadership with an overwhelming wave of panic the right won partly by threatening that the war would resume with an fsln victory the fsln leadership hadn t perceived the growing discontent within a large portion of the population many observers attributed the result to president daniel ortega s failure to abolish military conscription ed this illustrates the gap between the majority of the people and a leadership that had become used to giving orders many people wanted to avoid further bloodshed and thus reluctantly voted for the right hoping for a permanent end to war others were disappointed by the fsln government s policies in the countryside deficient agrarian reform and in cities negative consequences of the austerity measures enforced by the structural adjustment program begun in 1988 although sandinista organizations could still rely on support among young people workers and civil servants as well as among a significant number of farm laborers after the stunning electoral defeat daniel ortega adopted an attitude that swung back and forth between compromise with the government and confrontation the sandinista leadership with daniel and humberto ortega at its head negotiated the transition with violeta chamorro s new government humberto was still general in chief of a starkly reduced army the most left wing members of the army had been dismissed further on his order four sandinista officers were imprisoned under the pretext that they supplied missiles to the farabundo martí national liberation front fmln which was attempting an uprising in el salvador a few months into violeta chamorro s term a movement protesting massive layoffs in the public services gathered steam trade unions launched a general strike and sandinista barricades were set up in managua and cities acoss the country but the struggle was cut short with the fsln working out a compromise with chamorro s government while some austerity measures were withdrawn others remained part of the sandinista grassroots were disgruntled by the terms of the settlement this was to be the pattern the grassroots would mobilize the fsln would work out a compromise and austerity continued the public sector in both agriculture and manufacturing was reduced the public banking sector dismantled and the state s monopoly on foreign trade ended chamorro incorporated former contras into the police force austerity advanced it must be acknowledged that after the victory of the right a significant part of the estates formerly expropriated from the somocistas after the 1979 victory were appropriated by a few sandinista leaders those who organized this piñata claimed to be securing assets for the fsln against a government that might want to confiscate the party s assets daniel ortega s consolidation of power a grouping of sandinista militants from the revolutionary period came to reject the leadership s orientation in the years that followed that took time and daniel ortega took advantage of the slow dawning of awareness to consolidate his influence within the fsln marginalizing or excluding those who defended a different orientation simultaneously he succeeded in maintaining privileged relations with a number of leaders of popular sandinista organizations who felt that in the absence of anyone else he was the leader most likely to defend the gains made during the 1980s that explains in part why in 2018 the ortega regime still retained the support of part of the population this remained true despite his use of extremely brutal methods of repression ortega s consolidation of power within the fsln in the 1990s is best summed up by in a 2014 article by mónica baltodano former guerrilla commander former member of the fsln leadership and now a member of the movement for the rescue of sandinismo movimiento por el rescate del sandinismo mprs the dispute within the fsln between 1993 and 1995 persuaded ortega and his iron circle of the importance of controlling the party apparatus that became more concretized precisely in the fsln s 1998 congress in which what remained of the national directorate i e the sandinista assembly and the fsln congress itself were replaced with an assembly whose participants were mainly the leaders of the grassroots organizations loyal to ortega little by little even that assembly stopped meeting at that point an important rupture occurred by then it was already evident that ortega was increasingly distancing himself from leftist positions and centering his strategy on how to expand his power his emphasis was power for power s sake mónica baltodano goes on to explain the building of alliances that ultimately led to daniel ortega s coming back to the presidential office an alliance building process started then to increase his power the first was with president arnoldo alemán which produced the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 ortega s central aims in that alliance were to reduce the percentage needed to win the presidential elections on the first round divvy up between their two parties the top posts in all state institutions and guarantee security to the fsln leaders personal properties and businesses in exchange he guaranteed alemán governability by putting a stop to strikes and other struggles for grassroots demands the fsln stopped opposing the neoliberal policies in the following years the main leaders of the party s once mass organizations became national assembly representatives or were brought into the structures of ortega s circle of power with that they obviously stopped resisting and struggling for all the things they had once believed in those years also saw the forming of ties i wouldn t call it an alliance with the head of the catholic church cardinal obando the main purpose of that linkage was control of the electoral branch of government through obando s personal intimate relation with roberto rivas who had been heading the electoral branch since 2000 it also bought ortega increased influence with both the catholic faithful and the church hierarchy after alemán was charged with corruption and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment the agreement he had concluded with ortega proved to be profitable ortega saw to it that the men he had placed in the judicial system arranged preferential treatment for alemán allowing him to serve out his sentence under house arrest later in 2009 two years after his election as president of nicaragua daniel ortega gave his support to the supreme court s decision to quash alemán s conviction and release him a few days later alemán returned the favor by ensuring that the parliamentary group of the liberal party he led voted for the election of a sandinista at the head of the national assembly the constitutional reforms of 1999 2000 reduced the percentage needed to win the presidential election on the first round to 35 of the votes if the candidate has a five percent margin over the candidate coming in second ortega was elected with 38 07 of the votes in november 2006 and took office in january 2007 he was re elected in november 2011 and again in november 2016 in the 2016 election ortega s longtime partner rosario murillo ran and was elected as his vice president she had long been government spokesperson revolution betrayed since 2007 the policies which have been implemented by ortega and murillo have looked more like the policies pursued by the three right wing governments that succeeded one another between 1990 and 2007 than a continuation of the sandinista experience from 1979 1990 over the past 12 years daniel ortega s government did not carry out any structural reform there was no socialization of the banks no new agrarian reform despite the very important concentration of land in the hands of big landowners no tax reform in favor of more social justice free trade zone regimes have been expanded contracting of internal and external debt has been pursued under the same conditions that favor the creditors through the interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set payments they receive and that allow them to impose policies in their favor through blackmail in 2006 the sandinista parliamentary group voted hand in hand with the right wing mps in favor of a law totally prohibiting abortion there are no exceptions whatsoever including cases of danger to the health or life of the pregnant woman or pregnancy resulting from rape under his presidency ortega has refused to call the measure into question in fact the prohibition was included in the new criminal code that entered into force in july 2008 this retrograde legislation was accompanied by serious attacks on organizations defending women s rights and over the years they have been among the most active in opposition to the ortega government in another very troubling development references to the catholic religion have been systematically used by the regime in particular by rosario murillo who has made a point of denouncing women s rights organizations and the support they receive from abroad in their struggle for the right to abortion as being the devil s work nicaragua is still characterized by very low wages pronicaragua the official agency promoting foreign investment in the country brags of he minimum wage the most competitive at the regional level which makes nicaragua an ideal country to set up labor intensive operations over the recent years labor insecurity starkly increased the informal economy represented 60 of the total employment in 2009 a figure which stood at 80 by 2017 while the number of millionaires increased no progress was made towards a diminution of social inequalities the growth in wealth with the help of daniel ortega s government has mainly benefitted national and international capital furthermore ortega and his family have become wealthier the main trigger of the social protests that started in april 2018 was the announcement by ortega s government of neoliberal measures to be taken concerning social security in particular pension reform these measures were advocated by the imf with which ortega has maintained excellent relations since he took office in a statement published in february 2018 the imf congratulated the government for its achievements economic performance in 2017 was above expectations and the 2018 outlook is favorable staff recommends that the inss reform plan secures its long term viability and corrects the inequities within the system staff welcomes the authorities efforts to alleviate inss financing needs the most unpopular measures were a five percent decrease of the pensions meant to finance medical expenses and a limitation of the annual indexation of these pensions over the inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down rate future pension benefits for the close to one million workers affiliated to the pension system would be based on a less favorable calculation resulting in deep cuts in benefits these were the measures that sparked a mass protest movement at first mainly composed of students and young people other protest movements especially the mainly peasant and indigenous based movements against the construction of a trans oceanic canal quickly joined the canal meant as an alternative to the panama canal would if built en danger both the environment and livelihoods of peasants along the proposed route ortega did postpone the social security re forms but not before he initiated a spiral of repression which resulted in more than 300 protesters being killed by security forces and pro regime militiamen joining the protesters was a population horrified by the government s repressive response the protests radicalized demanding not only the release of those imprisoned but demanding the fall of the regime while unable to provide any evidence the government accused the protesters of being right wing golpistas and terrorists who were working towards regime change with the support of u s imperialism furthermore ortega and murillo strengthened their use of religious fundamentalist references and denounced the protesters as having satanic rituals and practices as opposed to the rest of the nicaraguan people because the nicaraguan people are god s people on 19 july 2018 during the rally on the anniversary of the sandinista revolution to try and strengthen his legitimacy ortega repeated these absurd satanic claims and called on the catholic bishops to exorcize the protesters and chase out the devil which supposedly had taken possession of them by the middle of july the government s policy of terror regained control of the streets subsequently mass arrests took place and several hundred people labelled as terrorists by the government remain imprisoned some tortured and forced to give false confessions by way of conclusion the sandinista revolution started as an extraordinary experience of social liberation and renewal of national dignity in a dependent country whose status as a backyard for u s imperialism had been accepted by its authoritarian dynastic rulers for decades the achievements of the sandinista government between 1979 and 1990 while they allowed for significant improvements of the living conditions of most of the nicaraguans did not break with the export oriented extractivist model dominated by big capital nor did they promote active citizen participation in the economic and political decision making processes the fact that the political institutions and internal organization of the fsln were left undeveloped allowed neoliberalism to regain a foot hold further there were no tools people could use to prevent the ortega regime from corrupting the other government institutions this understanding of the nicaraguan revolution and its degeneration stresses the need for revolutionaries and socialist activists to encourage the broadest possible participation of the masses in the fight for their emancipation as well as to maintain their self organization a corollary is the need for revolutionaries to struggle against the bureaucratization of their organizations leadership beginning with building organizations that respect internal democracy this was underestimated by the fsln which remained a political military organization after it had seized power it did not even organize its first congress as a political organization until 1991 after the victory of the right in 1990 the subsequent steps taken by the fsln leadership under daniel ortega were clearly meant for him to return to power for power s sake the left wing of the fsln which organized critical currents during the 1990s was too timid in its opposition finally the international left needs to have a materialist analysis of social and political processes there is no reason to cling to fantasized ideas of really existing socialism the evolution of the fsln and the policies they led in nicaragua since 2007 should be analyzed for what they are rather than on the basis of what daniel ortega and rosario murillo presumably stood for as fsln activists during the 1970s and 1980s clearly ortega and murillo s deepening of the neoliberal policies pursued by their right wing predecessors as well as their total ban on abortion should be denounced by the international left furthermore the left should strongly oppose the repression currently organized against the protesters and demand the immediate release of all political prisoners in adopting such a stance the left should in no way compromise itself by supporting a right wing pro imperialist opposition on the contrary this stance should be accompanied by an effort to link with and reinforce the critical sandinistas and other members of the progressive opposition to ortega and murillo we need to look toward the youth who have mobilized strongly since april 2018 to the feminist movement and to the peasant and indigenous movements who have opposed the transoceanic canal and other destructive projects linked with the export led capitalist mode

opinions of tuesday 7 january 2020 columnist godwill arthur mensah on tuesday january 7 ghanaians would observe the constitution day as a public holiday to recognise the fourth republican constitution which came into effect on january 7 1993 background the celebration is to remind ghanaians on the need to maintain and sustain the country s democratic dispensation which is widely touted as the beacon of africa s democracy however some constitution and political pundits have downplayed the relevance of the constitutional day celebration arguing that the 1992 constitution had lots of limitations that do not promote democratic rule and therefore called for serious amendments to some provisions in it they argued that the constitution conferred powers on the executive arm of government and upsets the required balance of power to other countervailing authorities the legislature and the judiciary they averred that the mere existence of a constitution did not necessarily promote constitutionalism and that it would serve the nation better if political actors reviewed and amended portions of the constitution to bring it at par with the principles of contemporary constitutionalism even though a national constitutional review commission was established by president john atta mills on 11th january 2010 to review portions of the constitution and subsequently submitted its report to government on 20th december 2011 not much has been achieved so far the country adopted a unitary republic with sovereignty residing in the people and designed to ensure probity accountability and the rule of law and ensuring power sharing among the three arms of government the executive the legislative and the judiciary the constitution according to constitution pundits reflected the lessons learnt from the previous constitutions of ghana such as 1957 1960 1969 and 1979 which incorporated some provisions and institutions drawn from british and the united states constitutional style rawlings regimes flight lieutenant jerry john rawlings a retired airforce pilot who for 10 years presided over the provisional national defence council pndc won the 1992 presidential elections and subsequently sworn into office as president of the republic on january 7 1993 ghanaians remember former president rawlings for his charisma championing the principles of discipline probity and accountability although some of his critics believe he was not in favour of a constitutional regime at that time president rawlings administration was credited to have led an economic recovery programme during his 10 years as the head of state under the pndc administration and eight years as the first president under the fourth republic rawlings was criticised extensively for presiding over a society characterised by so many human rights abuses and atrocities while freedom of expression by the media the judiciary and other members of the public were suppressed some of his admirers also applauded him for championing media pluralism in the country and allowing the establishment of private radio and television stations after serving two terms in office president rawlings handed over political power to john agyekum kufuor on january 7 2001 kufuor s tenure mr j a kufuor an economist and a lawyer popularly known in political circles as the gentle giant became the second president under the fourth republic after emerging victorious in the 2000 presidential polls he was sworn into office on january 7 2001 marking the first peaceful democratic transition of political power in ghana since independence in 1957 president kufuor was fondly remembered by many for his courageous decision to take ghana to the highly indebted poor country initiative hipc which cancelled the country s foreign debts restored the national economy and put it on the path of growth he introduced some innovative programmes under the five priority areas including the pursuit of good governance modernisation of agriculture for rural development private sector development enhanced social services and vigorous infrastructural development it was during the administration of president kufuor that the private sector was touted as the engine of growth and created the private sector initiatives for cassava and oil palm plantations which harnessed the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of ghanaians president kufuor s administration extended credit to some small scale businesses and made the realisation of all inclusive government a reality through the appointment of some minority political party members into his government and created positive image for the nation globally he also introduced the metro mass transport system the national health insurance scheme the development of model senior high schools the school feeding programme and the livelihood empowerment against poverty leap after serving two terms in office president kufuor bowed out of the political scene as the constitution of ghana demanded atta mills time the ghanaian electorate through the ballot box elected professor john evans atta mills popularly known as asomdwee hene into power as the third president of the fourth republic ghanaians liked him for his much touted humility which resonated through his speeches and relationship with his fellow ghanaians president atta mills showed his godly character by defiantly declaring to the western countries that ghana would not legalise homosexuality with his vast knowledge in taxation president atta mills introduced economic programmes and policies which reduced inflation to a single digit ensured a stable currency and increased the country s economic growth rate to 14 per cent in 2011 following the production of crude oil in commercial quantities after president prof atta mills sudden demise in 2012 his vice john dramani mahama was sworn in as president and led the country through a successful and peaceful election on december 7 2012 which he eventually won although the then opposition political party the new patriotic party npp led by its presidential candidate nana addo dankwa akufo addo disagreed with the electoral commission s ec verdict on the outcome the elections and subsequently went to the supreme court to challenge the election results the supreme court after eight months of hearing the feuding parties upheld the ec s decision mahama s regime president mahama who continued the policies and programmes of his predecessor steered the country to achieve some successes including infrastructural development such as the construction of roads community senior high schools health facilities and electrification projects however his administration witnessed prolonged electricity crisis otherwise known as dumsor he was defeated in the 2016 general election and ushered in nana addo dankwa akufo addo led government into office on january 7 2017 the former president also

viable businesses protect the public purse and fight corruption he reiterated his intention to fulfil those promises during his inaugural address on january 7 2017 and gave the assurance that he would

ensure a prosperous nation we want to build an economy that is not dependent on charity and hand outs but we want to build an economy that looks past primary commodity and position our country in a global market place we re not disclaiming aid but we do want to discard mind set of dependency and living on hand outs we want to build a ghana beyond aid president akufo addo assured president akufo addo named his ministers and other appointees in record time but some ghanaians castigated his government for appointing 110 ministers which is the highest number in any of the fourth republic governments the government rolled out its economic policy and budget statement in march 2017 with bold ambition to stabilise the local currency reduce inflation undertake debts profiling and ensure stable macroeconomic indicators and create a conducive business environment the akufo addo led government has so far performed creditable with three years in office and implemented some social

development is also ongoing to ensure self sufficiency and make the nation globally competitive in terms of exports in this vein free cockerels and piglets have been distributed to farmers across the country under this programme the government also backed the bank of ghana in embarking on the banking sector clean up leading to the closure of insolvent and non performing banks and financial institutions with government sinking over ghc13 billion in paying the depositors funds even though the exercise led to some 3 000 job losses it has saved over 4 5 million depositors from completely

i was lucky enough to do a tv slot on a local singapore business programme remotely from jakarta last night it was wonderful for two reasons firstly i got to strongly share my opinion on the australian federal governments leadership and response to the bush fire crisis readers won t be challenged in guessing my answer secondly a very pertinent question was would the global rotation in haven positioning continue as strongly as the previous days here my response was along the lines of markets have short memories much like the price action post the saudi arabia attacks last year and that if iran didn t respond immediately we had probably seen the best of the move iran is far too clever to be so ham fisted in its response to the soleimani assassination a reply will come but most likely indirectly and with plausible deniability in the instant gratification world we live in a lack of immediate action by iran has in fact seen the haven momentum wane overnight equities rallied in north america us bond yields rose slightly oil and gold gave back some of their intra day gains and the safe haven yen and swiss franc both weakened against the us dollar taking a step back from the us iran situation nothing structural has changed with the world most central banks are on a clear easing path developed market fixed interest returns ex the us are almost non existent to zero and thus the search for yield goes on the dips in equity markets for example in the absence of an immediate iran retaliation represent better levels to get long and thus the process of extracting value begins almost immediately the saudi arabia attacks of last year highlighted the short memories of the global financial markets as the global savings glut searches for a home extracting value comes in different forms however andrew my colleague on the analyst desk in singapore heads to the dentist this morning for a root canal and a tooth extraction i ve told him it wouldn t hurt a bit but it

better if political actors reviewed and amended portions of the constitution to bring it at par with the principles of contemporary constitutionalism even though a national constitutional review commission was established by president john atta mills on 11th january 2010 to review portions of the constitution and subsequently submitted its report to government on 20th december 2011 not much has been achieved so far the country adopted a unitary republic with sovereignty residing in the people and designed to ensure probity accountability and the rule of law and ensuring power sharing among the three arms of government the executive the legislative and the judiciary the constitution according to constitution pundits reflected the lessons learnt from the previous constitutions of ghana such as 1957 1960 1969 and 1979 which incorporated some provisions and institutions drawn from british and the united states constitutional style rawlings regimes flight lieutenant jerry john rawlings a retired airforce pilot who for 10 years presided over the provisional national defence council pndc won the 1992 presidential elections and subsequently sworn into office as president of

was not in favour of a constitutional regime at that time president rawlings administration was credited to have led an economic recovery programme during his 10 years as the head of state under the pndc administration and eight years as the first president under the fourth republic rawlings was criticised extensively for presiding over a society characterised by so many human rights abuses and atrocities while freedom of expression by the media the judiciary and other members of the public were suppressed some of his admirers also applauded him for championing media pluralism in the country and allowing the establishment of private radio and television stations after serving two terms in office president rawlings handed over political power to john agyekum kufuor on january 7 2001 kufuor

livelihood empowerment against poverty leap after serving two terms in office president kufuor bowed out of the political scene as the constitution of ghana demanded atta mills time the ghanaian electorate through the ballot box elected professor john evans atta mills popularly known as asomdwee hene into power as the third president of the fourth republic ghanaians liked him for his much touted humility which resonated through his speeches and relationship with his fellow ghanaians president atta mills showed his godly character by defiantly declaring to the western countries that ghana would not legalise homosexuality with his vast knowledge in taxation president atta mills introduced economic programmes and policies which reduced inflation to a single digit ensured a stable currency and increased the country s economic growth rate to 14 per cent in 2011 following the production of crude oil in commercial quantities after president prof atta mills sudden demise in 2012

party the new patriotic party npp led by its presidential candidate nana addo dankwa akufo addo disagreed with the electoral commission s ec verdict on the outcome the elections and subsequently went to the supreme court to challenge the election results the supreme court after eight months of hearing the feuding parties upheld the ec s decision mahama s regime president mahama who continued the policies and programmes of his predecessor steered the country to achieve some successes including infrastructural development such as the construction of roads community senior high schools health

hand outs but we want to build an economy that looks past primary commodity and position our country in a global market place we re not disclaiming aid but we do want to discard mind set of dependency and living on hand outs we want to build a ghana beyond aid president akufo addo assured president akufo addo named his ministers and other appointees in record time but some ghanaians castigated his government for appointing 110 ministers which is the highest number in any of the fourth republic governments the government rolled out its economic policy and budget statement in march 2017 with bold

000 job losses it has saved over 4 5 million depositors from completely losing their savings and resuscitated the ailing banking sector it has successfully taken the nation from the three year

excuses from the government they expected the government to mobilise resources both within and outside to add value to the country s primary commodities so that ghana would work again and ensure prosperity for all
the third year of donald trump s presidency appears likely to be remembered more for a looming impeachment vote than for anything else but a look back at 2019 through an economic lens reveals an economy that validates much of the president s twitter based boasting even though some areas leave room for worries about the future the main indicators of economic health have continued to move in a positive direction in the u s throughout 2019 despite the negative effect of the ongoing trade war with china however a tax cut and a sharp increase in the national debt practically guarantee that interest payments will take up an ever increasing share of the country s annual budget at the same time a downturn in the business cycle could find the federal reserve without the tools needed to cushion the impact jobs jobs jobs a promise to create new jobs was a constant feature of trump s campaign rhetoric in 2016 and since january 2017 the month in which he took office the country has indeed added jobs about 6 8 million of them according to the u s bureau of labor statistics in 2019 alone the country added an estimated 1 97 million jobs the strong sustained job growth drove the unemployment rate in november to 3 5 the lowest point in a generation the rate of job growth in the u s has not actually changed during trump s presidency at the beginning of the decade the country was starting to recover from the great recession from 2011 the first full year of the economic recovery through 2016 the economy added an average 2 43 million jobs per year in trump s first two years in office the economy added 2 42 million jobs per year growth during trump s first two years in office overall economic growth increased significantly between 2011 and 2016 the u s gross domestic product gdp increased by an average 2 07 per year in trump s first two years that average increased to 2 9 in 2019 however gdp appeared likely to end the year at a 2 1 rate of growth economists suggest the slowdown is at least partially due to the administration s policies in another of the president s signature interests foreign trade trade in 2019 trump escalated a trade war with china placing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports which resulted in retaliatory tariffs from china as a result u s consumers have paid tens of billions of dollars more for chinese goods than they would have without the tariffs and u s exporters have suffered a loss of business much of the tariff revenue is being channeled into subsidies for u s farmers whose products are being hit hardest by the chinese tariffs businesses in both countries are feeling the effects of the trade war with gdp declines evident in both the u s and chinese economies though the impact in china appears to be more severe growth in china hit a 30 year low of 6 in the third quarter of the year however it is difficult to separate out the relative effects of the trade war from other systemic factors affecting the chinese economy as its economy becomes more developed analysts say it will be all but impossible for china to maintain its track record of double digit growth rates trump s announcement in early december that he would impose tariffs on steel from brazil and argentina as well as his promise to implement a 100 levy on certain imports from france suggest that the negative impacts of the trade war with china have not diminished his eagerness to use tariffs as an economic weapon markets economists and other experts will rush to warn that the stock market is not the economy and they are correct but the markets do reflect the investing public s confidence in continued economic growth throughout trump s nearly three years in office market averages have continued on a robust upward slope hitting new records on a regular basis entering 2019 the markets were coming off a turbulent period but any doubts about their near term stability was erased as the year wore on with major indices showing year to date returns of between 20 and 25 through early december bond markets in which returns are usually an inverse reflection of investor confidence seem serene about the future with interest rates relatively low this means investors don t view lending money to corporations as especially risky at this point in time interest rates interest rates have been part of an economic anomaly since before trump took office with the economy steadily growing and unemployment declining the expectation was that wages would rise driving up consumer demand for goods and services as a result of increased demand prices would increase the typical response to price inflation by the federal reserve has always been to increase interest rates by making it more expensive to borrow money the fed could put a damper on consumer spending keeping inflation in check however as the economy began adding millions of jobs per year in the beginning of the decade wage growth was slow if it happened at all and inflation was consistently below the 2 rate the fed considers healthy after keeping interest rates near zero for years the fed began a cautious program of increases bringing interest rates up to 2 5 at the beginning of the year however concern about an economic slowdown driven in part by the trade war convinced the board to reverse course dropping the interest rates to 1 75 in october this leaves the central bank with little room to maneuver in the case of a severe economic downturn in which case the primary line of defense would be to cut interest rates deficit in a period of prolonged economic growth which should generate an increase in tax revenue the usual expectation is for the federal government to reduce its deficit under the trump administration the opposite has occurred despite a growing economy the federal deficit has increased every year and in fiscal year 2019 which ended in september the u s added 984 billion to the growing federal debt which now tops 22 trillion the increased debt load of the u s is a concern because of the share of the annual budget that is used on interest payments that share will only grow if revenue numbers fall in an eventual recession which many economists believe is inevitable in the coming years given that the economy is in the 11th year of an expansion
china s foreign exchange reserves rose to a six month high of nearly 3 11 trillion as of the end of december supported by stronger exports and stable capital inflows amid the financial opening up according to regulators on tuesday reserves increased by 1 1 percent over 2018 and were up by 12 3 billion in a single month in december suggesting general equilibrium of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market the state administration of foreign exchange said reserves decreased by 88 7 billion in 2018 the weaker us dollar index influenced by the easing monetary policy in large economies and price drops of major countries bonds have changed the value of foreign assets reserved by the chinese government a statement on the safe website said optimism remains although global political and economic uncertainties are rising chinese monetary authority remained optimistic about stable foreign exchange reserves in the future supported by economic growth within a reasonable range safe spokeswo man wang chun ying said on tuesday foreign exchange reserves usually refer to assets denominated in foreign currency including cash foreign bank deposits and foreign securities the reserves can be used to stabilize the exchange rate and repay foreign debts the us dollar index dropped by 1 9 percent last month to 96 4 while the chinese yuan appreciated to about 6 97 yuan per dollar at the end of december adding to nearly 1 percent in november recent research by morgan stanley predicted that the onshore yuan will appreciate modestly against the us greenback in its trade weighted basket in 2020 given a better economic growth outlook rmb fluctuations have become more market driven in recent years serving as an automatic stabilizer to changes in domestic and external conditions the research said the chinese government is expected to continue to open up the domestic capital market as a result robust capital inflows are expected to be seen this year which can maintain stable foreign exchange reserves and support a stronger yuan wen bin chief economist at minsheng bank said the stronger exports in december showed by some leading economic indicators such as the purchasing managers index has contributed to the rise of foreign exchange reserves because of the easing trade tensions between china and the united states in 2019 the central bank increased its holdings of gold by 2 7 million ounces to 62 64 million ounces by the end of december a level that was unchanged from october the price of gold almost hit the six year high test level to 1 600 per ounce up by about 2 4 percent this week because of elevated geopolitical risks across the heart of the middle east global investors are likely to reserve more gold to hedge fluctuations in the capital market as they speculate that iran will deliver on threats to retaliate against the united states for the killing of a senior general analysts said even the chinese central bank may increase purchases of gold in 2020 if the geopolitical risks continue to rise but the amount will not be too large said zhao qingming chief economist at the institute for financial derivatives under the china financial futures exchange key tasks pan gongsheng vice governor of the pboc and the director of safe said key tasks in 2020 include promoting the diversification of foreign exchange reserve investment and supporting the belt and road initiative he added that the safety and liquidity of reserve assets should be ensured while preserving and increasing their value according to a statement as china s financial opening up will continue more foreign investors will participate in domestic markets the reform of foreign exchange management is expected to be promoted steadily this year after major progress in interest rate liberalization reform said guan qingyou dean and chief economist at the rushi financial research institute

ghanaians are observing the constitution day as a public holiday today january 7 2020 to recognise the fourth republican constitution which came into effect on january 7 1993 the celebration is to remind ghanaians on the need to maintain and sustain the country s democratic dispensation which is widely touted as the beacon of africa s democracy however some constitution and political pundits have downplayed the relevance of the constitutional day celebration arguing that the 1992 constitution had lots of limitations that do not promote democratic rule and therefore called for serious amendments to some provisions in it they argued that the constitution conferred powers on the executive arm of government and upsets the required balance of power to other countervailing authorities the legislature and the judiciary they averred that the mere existence of a constitution did not necessarily promote constitutionalism and that it would serve the nation better if political actors reviewed and amended portions of the constitution to bring it at par with the principles of contemporary constitutionalism even though a national constitutional review commission was established by president john atta mills on 11th january 2010 to review portions of the constitution and subsequently submitted its report to government on 20th december 2011 not much has been achieved so far the country adopted a unitary republic with sovereignty residing in the people and designed to ensure probity accountability and the rule of law and ensuring power sharing among the three arms of government the executive the legislative and the judiciary the constitution according to constitution pundits reflected the lessons learnt from the previous constitutions of ghana such as 1957 1960

favour of a constitutional regime at that time president rawlings administration was credited to have led an economic recovery programme during his 10 years as the head of state under the pndc administration and eight years as the first president under the fourth republic rawlings was criticised extensively for presiding over a society characterised by so many human rights abuses and atrocities while freedom of expression by the media the judiciary and other members of the public were suppressed some of his admirers also applauded him for championing media pluralism in the country

while many of us were buying last minute christmas presents of socks and aftershave in argentina it looks as if the focus was on bitcoin according to incredible stats compiled by coindance bitcoin trading in argentina skyrocketed to an all time high in the run up to christmas peer to peer bitcoin trading in argentina coindance measures the volume of transactions over time on peer to peer p2p platforms it found that bitcoin trading in argentina in the week of december 21 reached a staggering 32 6 million argentine pesos approximately 544 905 us dollars that s 34 more than the volume registered in previous weeks and marks a historical record in p2p trading on localbitcoins a platform popular in the latin american country while bitcoin trading in argentina has cooled off again since reaching its peak the increased trading volume in december demonstrates argentina s growing interest in bitcoin at 55 44 at the end of 2019 inflation in argentina is among the highest in the world this makes it impossible for argentines to save in their national currency but why was there such a spike in peer to peer bitcoin trading in argentina the week of december 21 a historic distrust of its national currency argentines historically distrust their national currency and with good reason it s let them down many times before with wide scale devaluations and banking crises this has fostered an obsession with dollars in the country many argentines wishing to save or carry out transactions on high ticket items instinctively convert their pesos to dollars since president macri s sweeping defeat in october in an attempt to prevent capital flight the argentine central bank restricted the purchase of foreign currency to just 200 per month per citizen on tuesday december 17 the new argentine government led by alberto fernández announced a new series of measures to further hamper access to dollars and foster a new love of the peso the first of which is abolishing a tax on saving in pesos we need to recover savings in our currency said the new minister of economy martín guzmán as he announced that the tax on savings in pesos was being written off we also need to discourage savings in a currency that we do not produce which are dollars he added therefore in addition to the 200 monthly limit argentines will pay a 30 tax for the purchase of dollars and for any expenses abroad these include tourism making it harder for argentines to travel and even services such as netflix airbnb and spotify the tax will not affect expenses related to health medications books and research projects these measures are part of the so called law of solidarity and productive reactivation that the government plans to push through parliament according to guzmán it is the first step to resolve the economic and social crisis that argentina is going through 70 of funds collected with the dollar tax will go to the social security system while the remaining 30 will finance infrastructure and housing works in the country solidarity law pushing argentines to bitcoin the reasons behind the law of solidarity and productive reactivation may be well intended however it s hard to change a mindset built up over the years and encourage trust in the peso again it s certainly no coincidence that the spike in bitcoin trading in argentina resulted shortly after the new measures were announced argentina is not the only country in latin america to have a tendency towards p2p btc trading venezuela also reached an all time high that same week representing a 15 6 increase from the week before argentina s ravaged neighbours to the north in fact are still showing more and more interest in bitcoin trading registering another all time high the week of january 4 bitcoin a new latin american alternative argentina and venezuela are in the throes of complicated economic and financial crises the situation in venezuela is far worse with annual inflation of over 10 million percent however the argentine peso is also being weakened on an almost daily basis both countries are also struggling to attract investment and have restricted access to international credit the devaluation of local currencies is one of the main reasons specialised investors and a young tech savvy population have turned to bitcoin as an alternative to escape monetary depreciation and shield their wealth however the enormous obstacles and restrictions on access to foreign exchange have further boosted p2p bitcoin trading in argentina and venezuela these activities are not yet regulated by current legislation and have allowed investors to quickly exchange their local currency for units or fractions of cryptocurrencies that are traded internationally bitcoin may have been born from the ashes of the last global economic meltdown but the majority of its users are treating it as a store of value for countries like argentina and venezuela bitcoin is truly proving to be a viable way of escaping erroneous economic policies and weak local fiat currencies disclaimer the views and opinions expressed by the author should not be considered as financial advice we do not give advice on

fee s hispanic outreach fee en español is a program launched in may 2019 to formalize and grow fee s work in the spanish speaking communities of north central and south america and it s on a roll in a matter of months the fans on its facebook page ballooned from a handful to 120 000 we ve already surpassed 1 1 million minutes viewed on that new page alone dozens of videos in spanish or with spanish subtitles are set for release in 2020 on both social media and the website working with partners in mexico and colombia we addressed nearly a thousand students in those two countries this past november alone we ve distributed many thousands of copies of the spanish version of leonard read s famous essay i pencil and other fee publications under the leadership of its director javi perez fee en español will host or co sponsor numerous events in the region in 2020 fee en ecuador in this second week of january we are in guayaquil ecuador where i will deliver speeches over three days to various audiences in recent years more than 120 students from ecuador have attended fee seminars in the us so we expect a great turnout at a fee alumni event on january 8 we re also very excited about a conference in guayaquil on january 9 when we ll have the opportunity once again to work closely with long time friends at the country s distinguished free market think tank the instituto ecuatoriano de economía política ieep at this event we ll be commemorating the 20th anniversary of the country s dollarization in which ieep played a key role what economists call currency substitution takes place when a country employs a foreign currency either parallel to or in place of its own at least a dozen african countries for example use euros when a country adopts the dollar as its medium of exchange we call it dollarization that s what the government of ecuador formally embraced in 2000 though the citizens of that country largely switched from the local currency the sucre to dollars months before without any direction from the central authorities benefits of dollarization to those americans who wish the dollar itself was on far sounder footing than it is count me among them please you might wonder why any country would dollarize a hard money standard gold in particular arguably offers even greater long term benefits alas the world is an imperfect place sometimes you have to go for the most readily available alternative so in 2000 ecuador became the third country in latin america to dollarize panama and el salvador being the other two dora ampuero who co founded ieep with her late husband some 30 years ago is a respected economist and commentator and one of the architects of ecuador s dollarization in a 2015 article she explained the dire economic straits that preceded ecuador s adoption of the dollar ecuador entered dollarization under a full blown hyperinflation at the beginning of the year 1999 the rate of exchange was 4 000 sucres per dollar at the end of the year it reached 28 000 per dollar inflation was 60 percent and the rate of devaluation exceeded 300 percent in march the government closed the banks for a whole week then reopened and bailed out some of them by issuing bonds and created a new agency to guarantee the backing of deposits in the event of bank failure in 1999 the monetary base grew by 552 percent hyperinflations of latin american currencies are almost too numerous to count many of the countries there have experienced at least one in the last century bolivia ruined its currency in the 1950s and then did it again in the 1980s as documented in two videos about money i witnessed and wrote about brazil s hyperinflation of 1987 price inflation in venezuela increased briefly at a rate of 350 000 percent just last year it s the same old story government monopolizes money then debauches it to help pay for its reckless spending the people meantime get the shaft ecuador s 60 percent inflation in 1999 was calm by comparison to those examples but it was enough for ecuadorians to dump their government s currency and preserve their savings and purchasing power by switching to dollars george mason university economist lawrence h white described it as a bottom up phenomenon an expression of consumer sovereignty by money users to which the government finally conceded the dollarization of ecuador was not chosen by policy makers it was chosen by the people it grew from free choices people made between dollars and sucres the people preferred a relatively sound money to a clearly unsound money by their actions to dollarize themselves they dislodged the rapidly depreciating sucre and spontaneously established a de facto us dollar standard finally in january 2000 ecuador s government stopped fighting their choice until that point the state tried to use legal penalties or subsidies to slow currency switching when the government in quito officially opted for dollarization it did so by largely following a proposal laid out by dora ampuero and ieep hyperinflation disappeared prices stabilized interest rates fell confidence rose and with it so did investment and productivity dollarization was the success that the folks at ieep predicted it would be and that is what we will be celebrating in guayaquil on january 9 critics of the plan complain that by adopting the dollar ecuador s politicians and central bankers relinquished their power to employ their own discretionary monetary policy but if the experience of ecuador and so many other latin countries proves anything it s this you can do worse than america s fed and indeed most latin countries at one time or another have ecuador has a lot of work to do to get its economy on the right track indeed its regulatory environment is one of the worst for business in the region that makes me all the more grateful that ieep exists and is pointing the way toward freedom and free markets so while we hope for much more liberalization of the ecuadorian economy in the future we happily salute the ieep for its monetary policy success of two decades ago for additional information see
while many of us were buying last minute christmas presents of socks and aftershave in argentina it looks as if the focus was on bitcoin according to incredible stats compiled by coindance bitcoin trading in argentina skyrocketed to an all time high in the run up to christmas peer to peer bitcoin trading in argentina coindance measures the volume of transactions over time on peer to peer p2p platforms it found that bitcoin trading in argentina in the week of december 21 reached a staggering 32 6 million argentine pesos approximately 544 905 us dollars advertisement advertisement that s 34 more than the volume registered in previous weeks and marks a historical record in p2p trading on localbitcoins a platform popular in the latin american country bitcoin trading in argentina while bitcoin trading in argentina has cooled off again since reaching its peak the increased trading volume in december demonstrates argentina s growing interest in bitcoin at 55 44 at the end of 2019 inflation in argentina is among the highest in the world this makes it impossible for argentines to save in their national currency but why was there such a spike in peer to peer bitcoin trading in argentina the week of december 21 a historic distrust of its national currency argentines historically distrust their national currency and with good reason it s let them down many times before with wide scale devaluations and banking crises advertisement advertisement this has fostered an obsession with dollars in the country many argentines wishing to save or carry out transactions on high ticket items instinctively convert their pesos to dollars since president macri s sweeping defeat in october in an attempt to prevent capital flight the argentine central bank restricted the purchase of foreign currency to just 200 per month per citizen story continues on tuesday december 17 the new argentine government led by alberto fernández announced a new series of measures to further hamper access to dollars and foster a new love of the peso the first of which is abolishing a tax on saving in pesos we need to recover savings in our currency said the new minister of economy martín guzmán as he announced that the tax on savings in pesos was being written off we also need to discourage savings in a currency that we do not produce which are dollars he added therefore in addition to the 200 monthly limit argentines will pay a 30 tax for the purchase of dollars and for any expenses abroad these include tourism making it harder for argentines to travel and even services such as netflix airbnb and spotify advertisement advertisement the tax will not affect expenses related to health medications books and research projects these measures are part of the so called law of solidarity and productive reactivation that the government plans to push through parliament according to guzmán it is the first step to resolve the economic and social crisis that argentina is going through 70 of funds collected with the dollar tax will go to the social security system while the remaining 30 will finance infrastructure and housing works in the country solidarity law pushing argentines to bitcoin the reasons behind the law of solidarity and productive reactivation may be well intended however it s hard to change a mindset built up over the years and encourage trust in the peso again advertisement advertisement it s certainly no coincidence that the spike in bitcoin trading in argentina resulted shortly after the new measures were announced argentina is not the only country in latin america to have a tendency towards p2p btc trading venezuela also reached an all time high that same week representing a 15 6 increase from the week before argentina s ravaged neighbours to the

argentina and venezuela are in the throes of complicated economic and financial crises the situation in venezuela is far worse with annual inflation of over 10 million percent advertisement advertisement however the argentine peso is also being weakened on an almost daily basis both countries are also struggling to attract investment and have restricted access to international credit the devaluation of local currencies is one of the main reasons specialised investors and a young tech savvy population have turned to bitcoin as an alternative to escape monetary depreciation and shield their wealth however the enormous obstacles and restrictions on access to foreign exchange have further boosted p2p bitcoin trading in argentina and venezuela these activities are not yet regulated by current legislation and have allowed investors to quickly exchange their local currency for units or fractions of cryptocurrencies that are traded internationally advertisement advertisement bitcoin may have been born from the ashes of the last global economic meltdown but the majority of its users are treating it as a store of value for countries like argentina and venezuela bitcoin is truly proving to be a viable way of escaping erroneous economic policies and weak local fiat currencies the post bitcoin trading in argentina hits all time high in run up to christmas appeared first on coin

the bank of ghana bog on november 29th 2019 released a document justifying the need for the introduction of higher value denomination currency hvd notes the question of whether hvd notes are warranted at any point in time is not a merely conceptual one it is in fact a highly empirical enquiry to be approached from a careful analysis of considerable amounts of data about the proportional use of different notes and the differential costs of security and distribution one cannot have random opinions about such a subject and expect to be taken seriously i don t have any data on the contemporary usage patterns of the different ghana cedi ghs notes in circulation or about the costs of printing different notes like most ghanaians therefore i did not have too much difficulty delegating all thinking about the issue to the fine technocrats at the central bank until now a bunch of controversies arising from the refusal of major supermarkets and even banks to accept the new notes because they lack the means to validate their authenticity compelled me to finally take a look at the bog s explanatory documents today after all item authentication has been a decade and half interest of mine having now read the bog document and subsequent bog press releases on the subject i am suddenly completely unsure of my earlier faith in the central bank to do all our thinking for us in this matter i will simply lay out the worrying things i found and let readers of this blog judge for themselves the most problematic element of the bog s analysis is the central reason it offers for introducing the hvd notes in the very first paragraph of the original q a formatted release it states as follows high levels of inflation and currency depreciation in the past have eroded some of the gains from redenomination the deadweight burden reflected in high transaction cost has re emerged in this one statement is contained all the alarm bells about the depth of technical preparation that should have gone into this exercise except in cases of hyperinflation and hyper depreciation requiring a new currency series high value denomination notes are almost never justified by the need to counter or offset routine inflationary pressures over time for example when the 100 was first introduced in the us in 1869 and reintroduced as a federal reserve note in 1914 it was for a time the highest in circulation in due course larger denominations surfaced mostly as a result of wartime and other contingent exigencies by 1946 a firm decision to stop the issuing of hvd notes had been taken and by 1969 all currencies higher than 100 were being removed from active circulation to reduce the costs of fighting counterfeiting and money laundering today the 100 bill is worth only 4 if measured against its original value as a result of cumulative inflation it remains the highest denomination in circulation purely in keeping with contemporary policy an alternative policy of trying to preserve the face value of the 100 note at the time of the 1969 currency reforms would have required an introduction of 1000 and 2000 bills in the united states something that cannot be countenanced in today s anti terror and anti narcotics climate it is easier to understand the argument when one recalls that in a floating exchange regime currencies can rise and fall over time is the logic here then that should the ghana cedi strengthen against the usd consistently over time that would dictate the retirement of the largest of the hvd notes things are even starker in a managed exchange rate regime consider this fact by the time of the 1984 budget the official cedi usd exchange rate was 35 cedis to the dollar governor j s addo lowered the value to 38 5 cedis to 1 dollar in a conclusive reversal of the last peg from 1978 of 2 75 cedis to the dollar then in effect yet ahead of the latest round of managed devaluations in 1982 the highest note the 50 cedi note had been removed from circulation or demonetised ostensibly as an anti corruption measure echoing an earlier currency confiscation in 1979 when in 1984 the hvd notes of 50 100 and 200 cedis were introduced or in the case of 50 cedi note reintroduced with no serious explanation as to why fears of corruption were no longer an issue the effective worth of the highest value note was officially 5 by the time of the 1985 budget it was 3 7 more interestingly the parallel unofficial in actual fact market rate was about 156 cedi usd suggesting hence that the 50 cedi note that just 10 years earlier had been nominally worth 50 was now worth just 32 us cents 0 32 whilst the highest circulating note was worth just 1 28 in short the history of face value preservation tactics and politics in ghana betrays a ridiculous mixture of arbitrariness and confusion trying to bulwark the face value of ghana s benighted national currency notes against depreciation and inflation trends is clearly to court absurdity and also distrust in view of this messy track record at any rate the historical record clearly shows that ghana s highest value notes have for the most part generally exchanged for low dollar amounts in the 1985 to 1990 period the 500 cedi note moved from 5 5 to 1 5 peak to trough in the 1990 to 2000 period the 10000 and 20000 notes emerged as the highest value notes yet at their strongest they were about 1 4 and 2 7 respectively the dramatic change of affairs represented by the introduction of the 50 ghana cedi note in july 2007 with its debut value of 54 marking the high point of ghanaian currency face value politics in 30 years was a break with the past precisely because it also marked the start of a new series effectively a new currency such an exceptional development cannot set a precedent for the routine preservation of the currency s purchasing strength at some arbitrary usd rate by printing larger and larger notes to approximate the continuous appreciation of the highest notes nominal value s by the time of the introduction of the 100 and 200 ghana cedi notes in late 2019 the value of the 50 ghana cedi note in usd terms was about 9 in comparison with other hvd notes in ghana s history adjusting for both us and local inflation this amount as has already been shown above was big enough the largest nigerian naira note is exchanged today for 2 75 the largest kenyan shilling note is exchanged for 9 91 the largest south african rand note is exchanged for 13 8 by the time the government of india removed hvd notes out of circulation due to purported fears about money laundering and crime the highest rupee note was exchanging for 14 simply put economies comparable to ghana s in various characteristics have hvd notes well within the value range of ghana s last version the ghs50 note 2 the bog makes plausibly persuasive points about an expansion of incomes leading to an increase in preference for the then highest value notes the ghs20 and the ghs50 in the european common market for instance it is the 50 euro note not the higher value 100 and 200 euro notes or the 500 euro notes that are being demonetised over the usual concerns that are in widest circulation in the us the highest circulation bill is the 20 whilst the highest value 100 bill is mostly preferred outside the us thus the preference for higher value notes in ghana is a significant point however the point in the way it was put in the bog release that ghs50 and ghs20 account for about 70 of the total demand is completely vague is this demand being expressed in monetary value or quantity terms if in value terms then it is completely unremarkable since the face value being several multiples of the face value of the lower denomination notes their quantity could well be tiny and still constitute 70 of usage in such a scenario the need to print larger quantities would be far from clear and user preference may well tilt to a medium portion of the value spectrum as is the case in many other countries 3 it is important in connection with the above point to note that convenience is affected by both the concern about carrying large sums of low value notes and the almost converse concern about finding change when counterparties pay for goods and services with large notes thus preference is an entirely empirical matter and rather technically complex to compute if the bog wished to educate the public in this matter by releasing that statement it ought to have been clearer 4 most strangely the bog chose to provide none of the critical information that would have best assisted curious persons in evaluating the propriety of its decision to introduce high value denominations against the global trend of demonetizing high value notes at the heart of any sound analysis would be a trade off between printing less money and the concomitant result of users carrying less money and creating highly tempting targets for crime the cost of printing higher quantities of money in the face of a rising average size of transactions in the economy reduces the seigniorage revenue of the central bank thus if the average size of transactions moves upward it makes sense to introduce more hvd notes at the same time such notes are more expensive than lower value notes because they require more security features to prevent counterfeiting and more policing to suppress money laundering for example in the us the most expensive notes such as the 50 bill can be as much as four times 4x costlier to print than the cheapest ones such as the 1 bill the right balance between transactional convenience and policing cost is as always entirely empirical by refusing to provide a breakdown of the costs of printing the different bills and the quantities in circulation as well as the average velocity per class and other critical monetary parameters the bog shows a complete disinterest in helping analysts come to any sensible conclusions about the need for these new hvd notes 5 the weirdest of all the claims in the bog document is the assertion that somehow printing high value notes will reduce the deadweight burden associated with current transaction costs this claim is manifestly erroneous there is no welfare loss context here to even warrant use of the deadweight burden term 6 lastly we live in a time of great cynicism about the procurement practices of governments the introduction of a new class of currency notes represents a potentially major procurement opportunity for agents and representatives of the mints and printing presses in europe and america with whom the republic of ghana deals on these matters where the new bills are significantly more expensive than older bills commissions may be in order opening the door to unpleasant allegations about the real motives impelling the procurement action it would have been reassuring had the bog provided information about the procurement terms of this new production whether by de la rue the loss making financially struggling security printing firm or crane currency the controversy plagued contractor now embroiled in corruption allegations in liberia the decision to shroud all these important matters in silence including even the name of the printer mint is doing very little to dispel lingering doubts and confusion about this whole hvd notes printing business by bright simons the scarab source

new york january 6 2020 byron r wien vice chairman together with joe zidle chief investment strategist in the private wealth solutions group at blackstone today issued their list of ten surprises for 2020 this is the 35th year byron has given his views on a number of economic financial market and political surprises for the coming year byron defines a surprise as an event that the average investor would only assign a one out of three chance of taking place but which byron believes is probable having a better than 50 likelihood of happening byron started the tradition in 1986 when he was the chief u s investment strategist at morgan stanley byron joined blackstone in september 2009 as a senior advisor to both the firm and its clients in analyzing economic political market and social trends in 2018 joe zidle joined byron wien in the development of the ten surprises byron and joe s ten surprises for 2020 are as follows 1 the economy disappoints the consensus forecast but a recession is avoided federal reserve chair powell lowers the fed funds rate to 1 without a comprehensive trade deal in hand president trump exercises every executive authority he has to stimulate growth and ward off recession he cuts payroll taxes to put more money in the hands of consumers 2 inequality and climate change become important election themes but centrist ideas prevail the house of representatives sends articles of impeachment to the senate but donald trump is not convicted or removed from office enough information is revealed in the proceedings to cause some of his supporters as well as many independents to throw their support to liberal candidates in 2020 state races the democrats take the senate in november 3 there is no comprehensive phase two trade deal that limits china s ability to acquire intellectual property national interests result in the balkanization of technology the development of separate standards for 5g and other tech hardware proves to be bad news for the future of world economies the move toward decoupling gains traction in negotiations with china us economic co dependence with china erodes both china and the us keep their hands off hong kong and let the protest settle down by itself 4 the prospect of a self driving car is pushed further into the future a series of accidents with experimental vehicles causes a major manufacturer or technology company to issue a statement that it is no longer developing self driving technology 5 emboldened by the pain of economic sanctions iran takes advantage of america s unwillingness to intervene and steps up acts of hostility against israel and saudi arabia the strait of hormuz is closed and the price of oil west texas intermediate soars to over 70 barrel 6 even though some observers believe valuations are stretched a surge in investor enthusiasm pushes the standard poor s 500 above 3500 at some point during the year earnings increase only 5 and s p 500 multiples remain elevated because monetary policy is easy and investors become more comfortable that intermediate interest rates will rise slowly volatility increases and there are several market corrections greater than 5 throughout the year 7 big tech companies face growing political scrutiny and social blowback once the market leaders certain faang stocks underperform and the equal weighted s p 500 outperforms a proposal to break up the largest social media platforms and increase regulation and government oversight gains popularity this has greater success than prior government efforts against apple microsoft and ibm because it has widespread support from the american people a millennial in new york city puts a phone down and makes eye contact with another human and finds it non threatening and refreshing 8 having secured a workable brexit deal the united kingdom turns out to be the winner in its divorce from the european union the equity market rises and the pound rallies the uk benefits from a long transition period and growth exceeds 2 as foreign direct investment resumes now that the outlook is clarified the eu economy remains soft and european markets other than the uk underperform the us and asia 9 the bond bubble starts to leak but negative rates continue abroad even though the us economy is slowing the 10 year treasury yield approaches 2 5 and the yield curve steepens japan and china pull away from the treasury auctions rather than economic fundamentals or inflation supply and demand drive yields higher 10 the problems with boeing s 737 max are fixed and deliveries begin the plane becomes a mainstay around the world enabling airlines to operate more efficiently and increase profits the stocks become market leaders also rans every year there are always a few surprises that do not make the ten because we either do not think they are as relevant as those on the basic list or we are not comfortable with the idea that they are probable 11 fears of an economic crisis in india are allayed the emerging markets continue to have uneven performance but india recovers from decelerating growth the modi government continues business friendly growth reforms the economy grows at 6 and the market rises 20 12 artificial intelligence begins to be viewed as a paper tiger the ai jobs apocalypse fails to materialize much as the y2k bug failed to undermine the us economy 20 years earlier manufacturing jobs have already been automated and it proves harder to eliminate service jobs by using computer based applications 13 economic problems in russia intensify even though the price of oil rises as a result social unrest begins to spread putin s cozy relationship with his circle of oligarchs becomes an issue and his influence as a world leader diminishes he attempts to maintain his stature on the world stage through a closer association with china in spite of serious differences china and russia appear prepared to face off against europe and the united states 14 populism and inward thinking continue to spread globally particularly in emerging markets anarchy and disharmony spread throughout the world creating turbulence in financial markets everywhere investors turn away from emerging market local currency debt forcing spreads higher 15 north korea agrees to suspend its nuclear development program after another meeting with president trump but does not give up its existing stockpile kim jong un halts work on a long range missile capable of reaching the united states north korea continues to be a threat but not an imminent danger

global employment is nearing a peak and downfall cannot be ruled out a rise in unemployment may not necessarily have an adverse impact on the local currency we examine five countries and their impact on currencies local or foreign wages have become all the rage for central banks and that is a sign that employment has ceased to be a source of concern policymakers are puzzled by the lack of substantial salary growth as job markets are bustling complaints about the quality of jobs such as those in the gig economy have replaced pictures of people queueing up for unemployment benefits as employment is at high levels it is easier to fall than rising from this point a slowdown in global growth in 2019 has not triggered a substantial rise in the number of the jobless but 2020 may see a change how can it affect currencies we start from the straightforward cases and move to the more complicated ones 1 uk pound negative unemployment rate 3 8 as of october 2019 the lowest since the 1970s uncertainty about brexit has already weighed on the british economy growth has significantly slowed down and while investors are encouraged by the conservatives clear victory that provides a clear path to leaving the eu the future relationship with the old continent remains up in the air protracted negotiations after the official exit date on january 31 may cause a downturn that may eventually impact employment worsening economic conditions may bring andrew bailey the new governor of the bank of england to cut interest rates the boe hinted that it is ready to cut interest rates and two members voted for a cut in the past couple of meetings the government is unlikely to step in and help prime minister boris johnson is focused on brexit moreover his government may wish to spend political capital on reforms and boost the economy closer to the elections due only in late 2024 the proximity to the previous vote means that fighting unemployment is unlikely to be a priority all this leads to the straightforward conclusion that a rise in uk unemployment will likely push the pound lower 2 japan yen negative unemployment rate 2 2 as of november 2019 the lowest since the mid 1990s the world s third largest economy may have had a hard time battling low inflation but nobody complains about its rock bottom jobless rate the job to applications ratio stands at 1 57 a healthy rate as well japan is affected by the trade wars either directly from us tariffs or indirectly as collateral damage from the sino american spat if the economic situation deteriorates and unemployment rises the government is likely to step in and help however prime minister shinzo abe already announced a fiscal stimulus plan and the bank of japan is reluctant to cut the interest rates the negative 0 10 rate is hurting bank profits overall rising unemployment in japan may result in a weaker yen and little room for policymakers to turn the ship around easily in this scenario the yen s path is likely to be down 3 germany may eventually turn positive for the euro unemployment rate 3 1 seasonally adjusted as of october 2019 the lowest since the early 1980s the euro zone s largest economy enjoyed several years of falling unemployment as exports to china and more recently upbeat consumption have pushed the economy forward however the locomotive of the euro zone has been suffering a manufacturing slump in 2019 and the country barely escaped a recession the labor market has also shown worrying signs with occasional monthly increases in the number of the unemployed albeit within an upbeat trend if the industrial downturn continues or worsens the jobless rate may lift off from the historic lows while the initial reaction would be a lower euro in expectation for further monetary stimulus the common currency could later rebound how rising unemployment could sharpen the minds of politicians such as chancellor angela merkel s cdu and also her junior coalition partner spd to introduce fiscal stimulus the rising popularity of the green party may trigger investment in environmental technologies germany has been leading the old continent s austerity policy and has been clinging onto its schwarze null minimal fiscal surplus policy if berlin abandons its constitutional debt brake and sets an example for a change at the european level the common currency could rise it would relieve the european central bank from pushing the economy forward on its own overall a rise in german unemployment will likely send the euro lower only to rise later on 4 china fears of a global slowdown may boost safe havens unemployment rate 3 61 as of july 2019 the lowest since at least 2002 the ongoing trade spat between the world s largest economies has hurt china more than the us growth has slowed down to the lowest levels since the early 1990s but the jobless rate remains low the one state party carefully manages its economy and would intervene to mitigate any potential increase in people seeking jobs the regime is afraid of discontent and would also like to continue growing in global influence nevertheless any bounce in unemployment would be an ominous sign for the entire world it would show that the global economy is slowing down and send stocks down the safe haven us dollar and japanese yen would benefit in this case and so would gold 5 us dollar reaction depends on the democratic candidate unemployment rate 3 5 as of november 2019 the lowest since 1969 concerns about the labor market came and went during 2019 but central bankers see the us at full employment after over ten years of growth a slowdown in the economy cannot be ruled out and neither can a recession an increase in unemployment would likely push the federal reserve off the fence and trigger fresh rate cuts while that would weigh on the greenback it may also have the counter effect when the us sneezes the world catches a cold goes the adage investors fearing a global downturn may make their way to the safe haven us dollar and the japanese yen moreover a potential increase in us joblessness in 2020 may also risk president donald trump s reelection chances in that case the reaction of the greenback heavily depends on his democratic rival if a moderate such as joe biden michael bloomberg or pete buttigieg is the nominee markets would likely prefer a change in the white house to ease trade tensions and refrain from significant welfare spending in that scenario the dollar may fall amid a diminishing demand for safe haven assets on the other hand if left leaning elisabeth warren or bernie sanders makes it through markets would prefer trump the fear of a business unfriendly president may trigger flows to the safe haven dollar overall a modest rise in the unemployment rate would be us dollar negative while a substantial increase would put the focus on the democratic candidate whose chances would rise conclusion from rock bottom levels there is a good chance that unemployment will begin rising in 2020 increases in unemployment in the uk and japan will likely be detrimental to their currencies however it could turn into a positive story for germany a rise in chinese joblessness would likely trigger safe haven flows while labor issues in the us are difficult to trade given the presidential elections

climate politics there s a problem with america s favorite statistic gdp it avoids pretty much everything that s actually truly really good for society including the importance of robust ecology still it s the biggest measure of what s happening with the economy and used around the world even though horribly flawed according to some forward thinkers gross domestic product gdp the monetary value of all finished goods and services is a distortion that needs fixing nobel winning economist joseph stiglitz s former chief economist of the world bank new book measuring what counts the global movement for well being the new press 2019 tackles the issue by exposing its paramount importance in judging how society gauges prosperity or alternatively the failure of prosperity e g one in eight americans 40 million is on food stamps during the longest economic expansion in memory and 40 50 of americans don t have 400 readily available for emergencies is this failed prosperity gdp distorts reality by giving an appearance of real economic growth even as living standards stagnate for lower middling classes additionally gdp totally misses ecosystem collapse by abuse misuse overuse which is only noticed by the general public after it s way too late when it s easily noticeable even by those of low self esteem that blindly follow tyrannical maniacs hmm according to stiglitz the world is facing three existential crises 1 a climate crisis 2 an inequality crisis and 3 a crisis in democracy yet the accepted ways by which we measure economic performance gives absolutely no hint that we might be facing a problem accordingly politicians see positive gdp numbers which inspires them to continue with the status quo meaning they do not focus on key aspects for sustainability as well as human well being gdp does not compute environmental degradation gdp does not register societal divisions that build tension over massive wealth disparity and gdp overlooks calculations of lowered standards of living for the abandoned middle class as they increasingly deploy mountain loads of debt to support bogus lifestyles according to pew research center in real terms average hourly earnings peaked more than 45 years ago source for most u s workers real wages have barely budged in decades pew research center august 7 2018 where s prosperity furthermore according to stiglitz if growth is not sustainable because we are destroying the environment and using up scarce natural resources our statistics should warn us if we measure the wrong thing we will do the wrong thing stiglitz s new book with co authors french economists jeapaul fitoussi and martine durand discusses alternative metrics that more properly account for details like sustainability as well as how people feel about their lives in other words gdp does not paint a true life picture rather it s a wobbly ghostly statistic that measures business activity without consideration for humanity or ecology begging the question what s really important in life gdp numbers do not hint at trouble with 1 sustainability of resources 2 climate crises or 3 the well being of the people yet all three are crucial issues under stress like never before as an interesting side note according to jorgen randers a global forecast for the next forty years 2052 a report to club of rome commemorating the 40th anniversary of the limits to growth chelsea green publishing 2012 there s already a shift away from the use of gdp the sustainability revolution has already begun the new paradigm already emerged forty years ago or perhaps even fifty with rachel carson in 1962 it has spread since but it is still not mainstream we have evolved an increased understanding of the need to replace fossil energy but we have not really embarked on the challenge and some even in high places have started to talk seriously about the need to replace gdp growth with growth in well being as the overriding societal goal randers pg 13 furthermore gdp totally misses crucial points supporting societal existence from an ecological perspective as stated by christopher o clugston s blip humanity s 300 year self terminating experiment with industrialism booklocker press 2019 the premise of blip is that increasingly pervasive global nonrenewable natural resource nnr scarcity is causing faltering global human prosperity which is causing increasing global political instability economic fragility and societal unrest this scenario will intensify during the coming decades and culminate in humanity s self inflicted global societal species collapse almost certainly by the year 2050 gdp does not calculate does not represent and does not hint at the scarcity value associated with overuse abuse of natural resources accompanied by egregious planet wide degradation e g the gooey tar sands in alberta canada this is the world s most destructive oil operation and it s growing national geographic 2019 the missing gdp calculations result in cultural upheaval as people increasingly hit the streets in protest aware that something is not right and the canadian tar sands are proof positive that something is way way way off course it literally frightens the daylights out of people that seriously contemplate future prospects for society it s an actual horror story in the making in full operation and actually celebrated by neoliberal nincompoops no wonder kids are protesting in the streets adults behave like bloody fools blinded to a self destructive stupidity getting oil from gluey tar sands really or how about fracking with toxic chemicals man alive it s a wonder there aren t millions of people in the streets everyday according to nbc news 12 24 2019 in 2019 demonstrations around the world both peaceful and violent were set off by social unrest over economic instability government corruption and inequality 1 hong kong street protests peaked at over 2 million people 2 iran 304 people killed in protests over rising gasoline prices and government corruption 3 iraq huge demonstrations over corruption in government with 354 killed 4 lebanon a proposed internet fee brought hundreds of thousands to protest in the streets seeking economic reform and an end to government corruption 5 chile a million protestors hit the streets sparked by a subway fare increase of 4 cents but really opposed to abuses by government 27 dead so far 6 columbia tens of thousands protested the government 7 bolivia at least 17 killed as indigenous people protested a right wing coup tossing out bolivia s most effective president of all

published by tlaxcala int org and lapluma net on jan 1 aznárez is an argentine marxist journalist and the director of the e magazine resumenlatinoamericano org translated by john catalinotto there are years that seem to last so long that according to the popular saying they are like a century argentina has not been exempt from this comparison in this difficult 2019 that has just ended such has been the burden of pain suffering and signs of impotence that the population has had to endure because of the savage capitalism the government of president mauricio macri has imposed even the smiles have been erased from the faces of many people it is not easy to describe the mood of the largest sectors of the population as the statistics rang in their ears every day these generated a mixture of anguish and fury especially since this government which at last no longer exists was imposed on them not by military boots as in other times but by the people s vote a vote rigged and manipulated ultimately it was voluntary macri s atrocious setbacks let s go over some facts to get the picture macri left behind a final measure of poverty estimated at 35 5 percent beyond the percentages this amount placed us once again in a scene that we had already witnessed in 2001 children eating from garbage pails standing in endless lines with parents as hungry as their children at the door of luxury restaurants when at midnight they dump the leftovers of the day s meals into the street in large barrels those leftovers that had remained on the plates of people who could still afford to have three meals a day another familiar picture is repeated daily in slum neighborhoods where out of solidarity social and popular organizations provide dining halls to feed thousands of mouths what can we say about inflation which as never before has swept away everything that stood in its way when at the end of the year the rate is 54 5 percent this as everyone knows is not just one more piece of information its repercussions hit the pocketbooks of the population every day with astronomical prices increases in fares for essential services and the constant rise in the price of gasoline and its derivatives which in turn produce more increases in trips on public transportation unemployment was another atrocious chapter in the macrist era the number of men and women who lost their jobs is around 400 000 and there are studies that put it at around half a million the foreign debt which is illegitimate from every point of view is already very close to 300 billion u s which means that every argentine is already in debt to the for about 6 310 in every area during the last four years that could be analyzed there have been gigantic setbacks and in some cases the disappearance of historical conquests by the working class both those of lower economic standing and those of sectors of the middle class which the crisis has brought down several notches the people challenge education health housing are the sectors most affected by these policies that have not been applied only in argentina but are now being challenged in the streets by millions of people around the world examples of this challenge are in chile colombia peru haiti panama even in the france of macrón and its capitalist right wing has reached the end of this year with all its cities paralyzed by an unlimited anti neoliberal strike the constant and courageous weekly fight of the yellow vests latin americanized the rebellion in france the people are fed up they go out to put their bodies on the line in a thousand possible ways and argentina was no exception that s why august was a key month to launch the battle and shorten a year that had been hitting the workers hard the electoral explosion that the paso signified and the 15 point lead of the frente de todos over the macrismo candidates changed the mood of the argentine people from then until october it seemed like there was a long road ahead but the people were aware that the victory they had won was not going to be marred by the narrow rightists and their puppet masters in washington of course as many people in struggle proposed the ideal outcome would have been to corner macrismo in the streets under the slogan fight and they will leave that s what is happening today with sebastián piñera and iván duque but we already experienced a 2001 in which it seemed that the revolt was going to end in revolution yet this was not possible that is why this time the effort was made to reaffirm the feelings of the masses and what seemed impossible a year earlier for fear of fraud and macri s alliances with the u s empire became a reality alberto fernández cristina fernández won without leaving any doubt and this past dec 10 within 24 hours the joy and the celebration overcame all the accumulated sadness and pain when millions were cheering and celebrating their inauguration gains at home within weeks now that a new stage of the struggle has begun we know that it will be difficult and in some ways uncertain because of the threats of a local and international right wing who refuse to concede and who in the first hours of the new government has already shown its teeth but we already have much a needed economic emergency law wage increases for private and state workers including special bonuses for retirees a national plan against hunger increased taxation of sectors of the agricultural livestock oligarchy intervention in the intelligence services radical changes in the leadership of the security forces and an end to the criminalization of abortion which had been demanded unsuccessfully for decades foreign policy changes and there s also a turnaround in foreign policy by showing support and refuge to president evo morales overthrown by a coup d état receiving with all state honors cuban president miguel díaz canel and bolivarian communication minister jorge rodríguez and a long list of advances projects and concrete accomplishments that alberto fernández s government has put in place in only two weeks of course this is no panacea and there is still a long way to go but it is clear that these are measures that the people have longed for and will resolutely support it is even more clear since we know that the right wing has not stopped conspiring and that those the macrista policy favored ad nauseam are already paralyzing the country and threatening more forceful measures moreover the international monetary fund and donald trump will try to collect a debt that the people did not contract for and if they do not succeed in collecting it as they wish they will generate further waves of destabilization in the face of this probable future we must remember that this is once again the hour of the people and every step taken to oppose capitalism s insane strategy will only be won if the people struggle and put their bodies on the line in the streets as did the 30 000 disappeared people in their time and more recently the feminists and sexual minorities no one concedes anything without being pushed and that is the great lesson we must learn from the recent past it is not with flirtation or misplaced moderation that an enemy who cares only about accumulating profits is neutralized but only with resistance struggle and unity to defend what gains might be made and to make sure that politics is no longer deformed by the lovers of bourgeois democracy

billionaires beware sydney and kuala lumpur jan 7 2020 ips the latest november 2019 ubs pwc billionaires report counted 2 101 billionaires globally or 589 more than five years before earlier farhad manjoo had seriously recommended abolish billionaires presenting a moral case against the super rich as they have and get far far more than what they might reasonably claim to deserve manjoo also argues that unless billionaires economic and political power is cut and their legitimacy cast in doubt they will continue to abuse power to further augment their fortunes and influence in ways detrimental to the economic social and public good benign billionaires in defence of billionaires josef stadler head of ultra high net worth at ubs global wealth management argued that their wealth has also translated into their philanthropy as billionaires seek new ways to engineer far reaching environmental and social change philanthropic ethics expert chiara cordelli notes that philanthropy and donations have diverted social responsibility from governments and created other problems by bypassing democratic political processes and accountability the philanthropist should not get to decide in virtue of her or his disproportionate influence which world we should live in an ostensibly benign billionaire effect cannot offset the adverse impacts of billionaires wealth accumulation tax avoidance and abuse of power to corrupt political processes and policy making rather every billionaire should be regarded as a policy failure to create fairer societies we need to end extreme wealth concentration and its problematic consequences dubious sources robert reich has shown that a significant share of billionaires wealth is undeserved and does not bear any reasonable connection to their ability intelligence or contribution as expected in a society supposedly based on meritocracy and fair competition oxfam estimates that about a third of billionaire wealth is inherited there is no real economic case for inherited wealth as it undermines social mobility economic progress and meritocracy the main basis of legitimation in modern society other work finds that about 43 per cent of billionaire wealth comes from crony connections to governments and monopolies e g when billionaires use such connections and corruption to secure government concessions and contracts in developing countries this share was even higher 56 per cent according to a 2015 oxfam study the economist s crony capitalism index also suggests that corruption and crony connections to governments are behind much billionaire wealth another source of billionaire wealth is abuse of monopoly privileges granted by patent laws while intellectual property has been justified as necessary for innovation recent research summarized by the the economist disputes the supposed link between patent rights and innovation and deems the patent system a dysfunctional way to reward innovation or new ideas since the 1980s patent rights have been extended well beyond what may be considered necessary to incentivize innovation for richard posner a respected us judge such extensions offer almost no incentive for creating additional intellectual property insider trading taking advantage of privileged information not yet made public has been significantly abused for unfair advantage in markets the new york times has found some of the most prominent cases of illegal insider dealings have involved very wealthy people growing wealth concentration a large and growing share of the global economy is controlled by a few large transnational corporations tncs decades of mergers acquisitions and ineffectual anti trust legislation have seen market power concentrated despite claims to the contrary such tncs cartels other monopolies and oligopolies extract lucrative rents enabling them to secure super profits accelerating wealth accumulation and concentration at the expense of petty producers workers and consumers the way wealth is used by the super rich confirms their own social disutility they accumulate more quickly by paying as little tax as possible making good use of tax advisers and havens a study found that the super rich pay as much as 30 less tax than they should denying governments billions in lost tax revenue the extremely wealthy also get the best investment and tax evasion advice enabling billionaire wealth to increase by an average of 11 annually since 2009 far more than average investors and ordinary savers get dark money corrupts societies the secretive society of trust and estate practitioners step representing over 20 000 wealth managers has successfully lobbied many governments to reduce taxes on the richest step members clients and others of their ilk have spent billions to buy legal impunity politicians and the media to lower taxes on its clientele such lobbying has accelerated wealth concentration and accumulation such dark money is used to influence elections and public policy the world over an oxfam study has shown how politicians have been bought by latin america s super rich e g with substantial financial backing for ethno populist racist and religiously intolerant leaders over a century ago monopoly power was seen as a major threat to the us economy and society anti trust legislation and action especially by president theodore roosevelt broke up cartels and monopolies years later his cousin president franklin delano roosevelt warned government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organised mob neoliberalism oversold however in recent decades neoliberal economists have taken a much more benign view of oligopolies and monopolies distinguishing them from classical liberal economists committed to market competition conversely insisting on competition in small developing economies has effectively prevented domestic firms from becoming internationally competitive by building on economies of scale and scope significantly even the international monetary fund which imposed neoliberal policies for nearly four decades as a condition for credit support now accepts that neoliberalism was oversold while the world bank acknowledges disappointing growth after neoliberal reform deregulation liberalization privatization and globalization have strengthened the market power of corporations reduced the progressivity of tax systems reduced public provisioning increased the frequency and intensity of financial crises and slowed growth and development this article was amended on 21 january 2020 to

central banks in america europe and japan are on the verge of printing and handing out to their banks hundreds of billions of pounds of worthless paper money in yet another desperate effort to kick start capitalism through quantitative easing the us federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of japan are aiming at printing off 500 billion this year increasing to nearly 1 trillion by the end of 2021 this free money follows all the trillions of pounds already flooding the world after the financial crash of 2008 unleashing trillions of paper money was supposed to have stimulated the world capitalist economy by encouraging investment in industry in fact it has done nothing of the kind instead all this free money along with the near zero interest rates imposed by the central bankers went straight into a worldwide orgy of debt fuelled speculation on the stock markets while industries like car and steel across britain europe and the us have entered the new year facing the crisis of falling demand and country after country skirts perilously around outright recession in manufacturing the world stock markets recorded record highs instead of investing in productive industry which is crashing and producing little or no profit for their shareholders and bosses all this free money was used to massively inflate the share prices of companies that were nothing more than zombies existing entirely on debt the immediate prospect of these companies and corporations collapsing under the weight of their debt has been scaring the living daylights out organisations like the international monetary fund imf and the bank for international settlements bis whose role is to act as a watchdog over the capitalist financial system last year the imf warned that 40 of corporate debt in eight leading countries america china japan germany britain france italy and spain was so huge that the slide into recession would mean they would go bankrupt immediately unable to pay off the interest on their loans this will mean tens of thousands of businesses going bust overnight throwing millions of workers onto the streets in fact global corporate defaults have already emerged in 2019 and 77 of the corporations 66 of the total going bust were based in the us at the end of 2019 the us federal government s outstanding public debt stood at over 23 trillion for the first time in history if you include in this figure state and local debt corporate debt home mortgages credit cards student loans and other debt the total us national debt is around 330 of america s gross domestic product gdp the total wealth produced by the us this surge in the us government debt pushed up global debt by 7 5 trillion in the first six months of 2019 it now stands at over 70 trillion opening the floodgates of quantitative easing and releasing another trillion pounds of paper money into the hands of the bankers and speculators will only accelerate the economic crash that will devastate the lives of millions of workers and their families across the world it is this massive crisis of capitalism that is driving us imperialism to war with iran over the control of oil the immediate effect of trump s murderous attack and open declaration of war was to drive up the price of oil and cause the stock markets to crash under the prospect of an all out war in the middle east every attempt by capitalism to escape from its historic crisis through piling on debt and going to war over oil only accelerates the impending international economic crash across the world workers and young people are rising up against brutal austerity cuts inflicted to bail out capitalism and against imperialist wars the only future for workers and the people of the world is in putting this bankrupt capitalist system out of its misery through socialist revolution the immediate issue in 2020 is the building of the revolutionary sections of the fourth international in every country to lead the struggle for power going forward to the victory of the world socialist revolution
even as the united states continues to experience its longest economic expansion since world war ii concern is growing that soaring corporate debt will make the economy susceptible to a contraction that could get out of control the root cause of this concern is the trillions of dollars that major u s corporations have spent on open market repurchases aka stock buybacks since the financial crisis a decade ago in 2018 alone with corporate profits bolstered by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 companies in the s p 500 index did a combined 806 billion in buybacks about 200 billion more than the previous record set in 2007 the 370 billion in repurchases which these companies did in the first half of 2019 is on pace for total annual buybacks that are second only to 2018 when companies do these buybacks they deprive themselves of the liquidity that might help them cope when sales and profits decline in an economic downturn

reading time 3 minutes la paz in 2019 bolivia s political institutions were put to the test in the new year it may be the economy s turn many are hoping elections slated for may will help quell the turmoil that erupted after last year s disputed presidential election and subsequent resignation of president evo morales if the country can regain political stability and consensus the next government will have to quickly address an increasingly complicated economy one strained by high deficits low reserves and an overdependence on primary commodity exports jeanine áñez the senator who replaced morales as the country s interim president in november heads a caretaker government whose main mandate is to conduct new democratic elections smoothly but in addition to this main goal she also must ensure macroeconomic stability until the next administration takes office and macroeconomic stability is a difficult challenge at a time when hydrocarbons output bolivia s main export is falling due to both a depletion of existing reserves and reduced purchases from its main buyers brazil and argentina the bolivian economy is particularly vulnerable to exogenous shocks and resilience must be built however the transitory nature of áñez s presidency is in a way a straitjacket she doesn t have the time or the mandate to undo the main reforms of morales government however necessary that may be toward weathering the coming storm thus the new government to be elected in may will quickly face very difficult decisions concerning the economy from an overvalued exchange rate to adjusting domestic prices of heavily subsidized fuels the next administration will face several stumbling blocks more broadly bolivia s next president will have to take actions to narrow the fiscal deficit and to redress the external accounts at first morales economic legacy seems impressive from 2006 the year he took office through 2018 gdp growth averaged 4 9 according to world bank data annual inflation meanwhile averaged 5 5 accumulated international reserves reached 15 billion or close to 50 of gdp in 2014 as important the percentage of people living in poverty declined from 59 6 in 2005 to 36 4 in 2017 and inequality measured by the gini index fell from 58 5 to 44 0 yet despite these good numbers bolivia s long term development problems remain or even worsened and the country s insertion into the international economy is still a distant reality to understand the complicated panorama facing the next government we have to look back at morales first term which began during the decade long export boom that overlapped with his administration and influenced his non conventional economic policies the long cycle of high export prices followed important findings of natural gas privatizations and changes in the tax legislation done in the 1990s the windfall income that bolivia received out of the improvements in its terms of trade amounted in some years to a huge 8 of gdp the export boom aided a fast increase in deposits in the banking system which in turn contributed to a surge in financing of residential construction since construction is very labor intensive open unemployment dropped the informal labor sector also expanded though for different reasons more than morales own policies high rates of economic growth helped improve social progress indicators behind the positive trend however a number of issues persisted which may have kept the bolivian economy from doing even better than it did namely there was little diversification of exports and production under morales in fact exports became more concentrated than ever in hydrocarbons metals and grains worse the spike in income was not invested at all in institutional strengthening on the contrary crucial institutions like checks and balances rule of law and the independence of the central bank were severely impaired property rights were weakened and the private sector was treated with extreme ambiguity despite morales anti market policies which included nationalizations and a significant expansion of state owned enterprises he executed his policies with some caution which helped bolivia avoid the kind of pain experienced by its neighbors when the commodities boom ended in 2014 still the country s loss of export income was as high as 40 in 2015 in the subsequent years the situation improved modestly morales tried to prolong the effects of the export bonanza by pushing public investment driving up the fiscal deficit which has been close to 7 5 of gdp since 2015 the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments in the same period was also very large at over 5 of gdp on average these twin deficits have been financed by depleting bolivia s international reserves which in october 2019 was at half of its peak value reached in 2014 and by some modest increase in external debt notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned above a reasonable rate of gdp growth above the latin american average can still be attained in 2020 it will require the private sector responding strongly to an expected improvement in business climate with less policy constraints on private sector initiatives and investment the bolivian economy can grow become diversified and ensure equity but first the reestablishment of confidence is crucial this depends very much on the handling of the transition by áñez and whoever bolivians entrust to lead the country come may morales was the president of bolivia s central bank from 1996 to 2006 he is currently a professor of economics at the catholic university of bolivia

from brexit to the gilets jaunes protest movements in europe and elsewhere have shocked political elites in recent years at their heart is a sense that economic growth has left many people worse off even if in most countries the headline gdp figures suggest that countries are much wealthier challenging the idea that economic growth will automatically lead to development and wellbeing is one of the main themes in the 2019 human development report by the un development programme undp published in december achim steiner the administrator of the undp told euractiv that policy makers need to look beyond the gdp figures and economic indices that simply do not capture the perception is that things are not getting better but that they are in fact getting worse and that is breeding distrust of the political process income per capita and gdp is an inadequate way to respond to growing inequalities you have to go beyond averages we need a more calibrated view of where a country is at that looks at the basic health and education indicators added steiner europe has seen some of the biggest gains in human development over the past decade ireland had the highest increase in rank on the report s accompanying human development index hdi rising 13 places between 2013 and 2018 seven of the top 10 positions on the hdi are held by european countries five of which are members of the european union yet european countries have generally experienced the same broad inequality trends as countries elsewhere both income and wealth inequality have deepened in many countries even though inequalities drop significantly after taxes and transfers more importantly disparities persist in health and education its estimates show the top 10 pretax income earners received 29 of total regional income in 1980 rising to 34 in 2017 the incomes of the top 0 1 of earners more than doubled during the period and the incomes of the top 0 001 nearly tripled the bottom 50 received 24 of total regional income in 1980 but only 20 by 2017 meanwhile despite overall reductions in poverty hunger and disease a new generation of inequalities is opening up according to the hdr we want a more constructive and empowering debate in countries said steiner adding that the purpose of the report is to connect countries and increase understanding inequality beyond the traditional yardsticks that will yield better policy outcomes steiner believes that we are seeing the emergence of 21st century inequalities such as access to higher education pointing out that access to tertiary education is developing 15 times faster in wealthier countries similar patterns and social divides are emerging outside europe in developing countries and it tends to be the lower middle class that suffers the most steiner points out that although colombia is about to join the organisation for economic co operation and development the paris based group of wealthy countries because of conflict one third of its population are left unserved by the state one of the questions that steiner wants political leaders across the world to address is what is fair globalisation although the undp works with the economist thomas piketty co director of the world inequality lab in paris the report says that radical changes to taxation policy particularly increases are not going to be enough on their own inequalities begin before birth said steiner pointing out that the average american child in a wealthy family has more than 300 words in their vocabulary far more than their counterparts across most of the world tax is not everything he adds steiner believes instead that more efficient tax collection alongside efforts to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share is the way forward particularly in developing countries across africa we have a tax base that far exceeds receipts from development aid and that is a turn around from the 1960s africa s ability to finance their development has rapidly grown tax authorities are becoming far more efficient in terms of revenue collection he added he also pointed to countries where administrations have introduced e government platforms and also digitised land ownership and financial services kenya is turning upside the traditional methods of financial inclusion m pesa takes away the transaction costs you can borrow money in the morning buy your goods to sell in the market and then repay the loan in the evening said steiner he said one of the common messages being borne out of the undp s research is about the lack of fairness in economic growth and development i m losing my dignity is the phrase we heard in latin america he added the protests have a trigger steiner said pointing to the wave of demonstrations across europe and elsewhere it is the combustion that has accumulated in many societies at a point people say enough we need to understand why people feel the way that they do and that is where economists have been falling short read more with euractiv johnson takes control but charts a bumpy brexit course the uk will leave the eu in january but the article 50 process was always supposed to

for 45 years ivan shadryn has waited for the bridge over siberia s mighty lena river to be built in the winter it s not so bad subarctic temperatures freeze the lena enabling long haul truckers like shadryn to drive across the ice making the journey to bring say construction goods from his native city of yakutsk to the pacific port of magadan 2 000 kilometers to the east easier in the summer the river crossing is worse it takes up to two hours to cross by ferry and cargo truck traffic in and out of yakutsk the largest city in russia s far north slows dramatically and the shoulder seasons of late spring and early winter mean there is no cross river truck traffic at all for about 150 days of the year president vladimir putin has now given a green light to the 83 billion ruble 1 3 billion plan to finally build the lena river bridge it is scheduled to be completed in 2025 according to the business daily kommersant no question it ll make everything easier shadryn who retired from driving last year told rfe rl not just for truckers it ll make life easier for everyone in yakutsk the city has changed a lot already but this will be something entirely new if yakutsk is hoping the new bridge will change the city the kremlin is hoping a series of similarly ambitious plans labeled national projects will transform the economy once and for all from resource dependent and hydrocarbon fueled to technology driven and powered by the country s vast and underutilized scientific and academic potential whether that can really happen is an open question the six year 400 billion national projects effort which targets areas including education health care science roads and infrastructure comes at a time when a growing number of economists and researchers have been sounding the alarm saying that russia s economy is in danger of slipping into stagnation some warn that the way the national projects are being implemented may only exacerbate the problem there s all this talk about national projects being needed to facilitate growth said laura solanko a specialist on the russian economy at the bank of finland s institute for economies in transition but the main problem is that private firms are not investing because they have little to gain she suggested the growth isn t lack of public spending solanko said the real constraining factor is the overall business climate in russia who are they supposed to help what are they supposed to achieve janis kluge a senior researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin said of the national projects they are trying to motivate the bureaucracy to set some clear goals but it will not be much help the general trends underlying russia s economic development point to economic stagnation with significant risks to the downside he said economic paradox one of the paradoxes of russia s economic situation analysts say is that fiscally the government is one of the strongest in the world budget surplus huge reserves conservative budgeting targets in 2019 russia for the first time succeeded in having its public debt fully covered by public savings something that no other emerging economy has managed to do at a meeting november 12 in brazil putin touted his government s economic policies highlighting what he called a responsible approach to public finances maintaining the stability of the banking and credit markets and striving to help strengthen key sectors of the economy of course we do not believe that the current gdp growth rate is sufficient so we are trying to create the most supportive conditions for new investments he said yet the economy continues to grind along at a subpar pace and average russians are increasingly the ones suffering disposable incomes are falling when adjusted for inflation the average amount of money russians bring home is less than it was in 2014 the year that western countries punished moscow with sanctions for its seizure of ukraine s crimean peninsula in the first half of 2019 the world bank found real disposable incomes fell by 1 3 percent from the previous year public opinion surveys from the independent polling agency levada center show that around 65 percent of russian households have no savings whatsoever bankruptcies are on the rise with a 50 percent increase in russians filing for bankruptcy between 2016 and 2018 according to government statistics and they were on track to be still higher in 2019 state statistics also show that overall poverty has increased from the beginning of 2018 rising to 14 3 percent or about 20 3 million people after growing by 2 3 percent in 2018 the economy looked set to grow by 1 percent in 2019 the world bank forecast well below the targets the kremlin and government officials have set add to this the fact that pensions have been effectively cut for coming years as the government raised the age when russians can start receiving the pensions a highly controversial step that was met with widespread protests and taxes were hiked with a 2 percentage point increase in the national value added tax vat that officials project will generate revenue 600 billion rubles 9 4 billion to pay for the national projects watch 1 000 percent interest consumer debt weighs on russian households the national projects were announced in 2018 and launched in 2019 more than a year in figures from the audit chamber showed that less than one third of the funds allocated for them in 2019 had been used as of the end of june that has perplexed analysts and frustrated government planners said ivan tkachyov the economics editor at the russian business newspaper rbk the government faces such chronic problems as poor management tons of paperwork and bureaucracy and the additional layer of multiple clearances and approvals when you allocate money from the federal budget to the regions tkachyov told rfe rl but for the sake of objectivity a positive aspect is that instead of dropping money from a helicopter like they used to do the finance ministry is taking it very seriously and now frees up money only when it s 100 percent sure it will be spent efficiently still corruption remains entrenched and is getting worse according to some polls and analysts warn that massive infrastructure projects are ripe for contractors to skim off budget funds the vostochny cosmodrome a space launch facility whose construction has been hampered by large cost overruns long delays and rampant graft is exhibit a for anti corruption crusaders like opposition gadfly aleksei navalny a failed project that is still being built years after its deadline has passed with a budget that has doubled during which billions were stolen of course it should be named after vladimir putin navalny said in a mocking video released november 21 a handful of launches have been conducted but the facility is still under construction at an already astronomical cost of 7 65 billion and rising looking for growth in the wrong places the kremlin has discussed proposals for ambitious potentially economy transforming projects since early in putin s presidency in the 2000s but it was only in 2018 that the national projects finally took shape the economic development ministry has estimated that investments related to the national projects will result in an 85 percent increase in the rate of growth over six years but the problem with the slow start in spending is the danger that the projects could become a drag on the economy instead of a boon to it according to an analysis released by oxford economics in october the national projects are no breakthrough for russia s growth model as long as institutions continue to constrain productivity and the working age population declines russia is still looking for growth in the wrong places wrote yevgenia sleptsova who led the research that conclusion was echoed in part by the state owned bank vtb in a report released on november 20 which found that most of the national projects were not on target to meet their goals ambitions part of the issue is the question of ambition solanko said the kremlin aspires to put russia on par economically with the united states germany france and other members of the group of seven industrialized nations that requires at least 3 percent annual growth russia wants to be a high income country so stagnation is certainly not a choice at all she said in that sense stagnation is a disappointment it would be a disappointment anywhere but it is certainly for a country that aspires to be a high income country georgy bovt a russian political scientist and kremlin critic argued that government efforts to boost gdp through massive spending programs like the national projects were misguided the entire system needs to be reformed he said this would have to begin with judicial reform with the aim of genuinely achieving the equality of all before the law dispensing with the principle for my friends everything for my enemies the law he wrote in an op ed article we are talking about a whole range of political reforms for now everyday life in russia is more reminiscent of a fortress under siege whose inhabitants are asked time and again to make more holes in their belts the better to tighten them with he wrote that poses a new problem for kremlin planners the 2021 elections for the lower house of parliament currently controlled by the kremlin allied united russia party whose popularity ratings are abysmally low the state duma elections will set the political stage for 2024 when putin in power as president or prime minister since 1999 is constitutionally barred from seeking a third straight term some forecasters predict that the backlog of spending for the national projects will give way to a burst of activity in the first half of 2020 as planners rush to spend the allocated funds that could give the economy a boost for political planners trying to generate sympathy among the electorate however the problem is that the national projects are not the best instrument to do that big spending on bridges and roads for example will benefit steel mills asphalt companies and heavy vehicle manufacturers more than voters the kremlin will face the temptation to indulge in populist spending to bolster a sagging election campaign that could drain the national projects if you want to get political support you raise salaries for state sector workers kluge said the lena river bridge isn t formally part of the national projects plan but government planners have been talking about building it since the early 1980s according to truck driver shadryn earlier in the past decade the project seemed to get approval to move forward finally but according to news reports the bridge was downgraded in priority after the crimea annexation in 2014 and the kremlin s push to build a bridge over the kerch strait linking the peninsula with russia now the proposed 3 000 meter span over the lena one of russia s longest rivers will finally link yakutsk a city of 300 000 with the national highway system it s not formally part of the national projects though it falls into one of the plan s 12 categories for roads and transportation if it s built shadryn said it ll be really difficult to build the bridge he said the river banks the ice we have 40 below cold here and then who knows if someone will try and steal the funds he added laughing
this article first appeared in forum the edge malaysia weekly on january 6 2020 january 12 2020 it is hardly surprising that many economists expect the global economic uncertainty to prevail in 2020 economic news headlines in recent months say it all manufacturing momentum in the us is still lacklustre based on november readings of the widely followed purchasing managers index pmi global trade barometers still show a downward trend and worldwide semiconductor sales continue to fall to put it in layman s terms prospects remain uninspiring as far as economists are concerned however the equity markets reflect none of this pessimism upbeat headlines flash everywhere the euphoria among equity investors is especially noticeable in the us whose stock market surged to a record high in december 2019 despite news of president donald trump s impeachment by the house of representatives equity investors shrugged off the news and continued to ramp up purchases of us stocks driving benchmark indices up by mind boggling percentages on a year to date basis third week of december 2019 the us s p 500 index has gained 28 while the nasdaq composite index has surged 35 the last time stocks gained this much in a year was in 2013 of course analysts have attributed the improving sentiment in recent weeks to phase one of the trade deal secured by the us and china the belief that trump will retain his presidency thanks to strong support from his fellow republicans also supports the upbeat mood other boosts came in the form of marginal gains in the output and new orders sub indices of the global pmi and the slightly better than expected us gross domestic product gdp growth numbers released for the third quarter still these do little to assuage economists concerns why first and foremost the global economy will likely not get a near term lift from advanced economies while it is true that the international monetary fund is projecting slightly stronger growth in 2020 3 4 versus 2019 s expected growth of 3 0 its forecast assumes that emerging economies will lead the turnaround in global growth momentum growth in advanced economies on the other hand is expected to remain stagnant is this a realistic scenario to paint for 2020 it is if we look closer at major economies like the us eurozone and china while the us growth looks surprisingly resilient at this juncture its outlook remains slightly different if one were to judge by recent statistics in particular headwinds from slowing global demand and looming trade policy uncertainties are starting to build up for instance the new orders sub index of the us manufacturing pmi a forward looking indicator remained lacklustre suggesting a low probability of a near term upside rebound growth in business investment also slowed to 1 3 year on year in the third quarter of 2019 compared with the 6 8 expansion recorded in the corresponding quarter in 2018 there are also growing signs that weaknesses in the manufacturing sector and business investment have started to spill over into other parts of the us economy a case in point average hourly wage growth slowed to 3 1 last november 3 4 in february 2019 despite favourable labour market conditions and interestingly consumers are turning cautious as evidenced by a decline in inflation adjusted consumer spending growth to 2 6 in october from august s 3 7 across the atlantic ocean european economies are also expected to remain subdued with real gdp growth remaining circa 1 2 in the third quarter the uk s growth was stuck at 1 during the period as weakening global trade and brexit related uncertainties took a toll on industrial activity and business investment germany the key growth driver of the eurozone was particularly impacted by the industrial downturn and led the decline in the region s growth china an emerging economy has its own set of issues to deal with its growth momentum continued to slip with real gdp growth falling to a 27 year low of 6 in the third quarter the slowdown was partly attributed to a moderation in fixed asset investment growth to 5 2 in the first 10 months of 2019 the slowest reading since 1998 a re escalation of trade tensions between the us and china could exacerbate the slowdown of china s economy and don t forget china is also confronting risks of a contagion from recent episodes of corporate bond defaults total corporate defaults were reported to be in the range of rmb120 billion rm70 4 billion in the first 11 months of last year close to the rmb122 billion seen the year before concerns have arisen over the pressure on the chinese government to support some important corporates in order to prevent a contagion another point of concern is the constraint faced by major central banks in propping up their economies specifically they could run out of monetary ammunition to support growth heads are turning to fiscal measures to do the trick while advanced economies are expected to rely on fiscal policies to do the heavy lifting this will be unlikely if debt concerns emerge a country like germany has always been sceptical about using fiscal policy to support growth some emerging economies for example india and malaysia have limited fiscal space they will likely remain cautious about spending for fear of expanding their budget deficits there is talk of the possible emergence of grey swan events some executives and market analysts are also looking at the likelihood of japan s central bank using its exchange rate tools to defend its export sector and prop up its economy and the us introducing measures to protect american businesses that is to prevent chinese companies from buying us technology companies these are logical and cannot be ruled out so why are investors still banking on equities in 2020 for one thing market psychology is hard to predict and this herd behaviour could continue to push the market up until someone turns around and says hey there s too much exuberance now in 1996 alan greenspan uttered those words we know the phrase will eventually be repeated although the timing is beyond anyone s knowledge what remains true is that when things look too good to be

by vytenis šimkus senior economist swedbank despite a very long economic cycle interest rates across the world remain very low due to worries about the health of the world economy most central banks have yet again postponed any plans for monetary tightening the universe of government bonds with negative yields is above 17 trillion and close to record highs in general different asset valuations suggest that the market is confident that rates are not going to rise for a very long time and the market has good reasons to assume so due to ageing the natural rate of interest r is likely to be dragged down by about one percentage point pp in the euro area over the next couple of decades before it starts to recover as the composition of savers dissavers changes to see how interest rates are affected by potential growth and demographics in the euro area we have conducted a scenario analysis this clearly illustrates that many of the interest rate determinants lie outside of the central bank s mandate the success of governments in implementing productivity enhancing reforms is the key to determining the direction of interest rates what is the natural interest rate and how does it relate to monetary policy the natural rate of interest was first defined by knut wicksell more than a century ago according to his definition it s a rate that should equalise the returns in the real and the financial markets and therefore be neutral in terms of inflation a recent popular way of estimating r was developed by t laubach and j c williams 2003 who define it as an intersection of investment savings is and phillips curves the is curve represents the equilibrium state where total investment equals total savings while the phillips curve ought to represent the business cycle fluctuations according to the prevailing definition much rests upon the natural rate of interest equalising the saving and investment rate and therefore marginal returns inthe goods and money markets ensuring full employment and stable prices the problem is that the natural rate is unobservable and can be estimated only by using a range of methods the estimates are often very unreliable and some even question if a single number is capable of putting all of these variables in equilibrium this is a valid concern knowing that dual mandate central banks often see their objectives as contradicting each other in theory central banks policy rates should converge to the natural rate in the medium term as the output gap closes in the short term policy rates can deviate from the natural rate as central banks attempt to achieve their mandates a central bank would cut the rate below the natural rate in case of a recession in order to stimulate it then bring it back up to the natural rate as the output gap closes and vice versa for an overheating economy under inflationary pressure determinants of the natural rate various estimates show that the natural interest rate has been declining in the past decades several fundamental factors are at play in determining the natural rate of interest one of the main drivers of the r decline has been ageing in the advanced economies ageing affects the natural rate of interest via at least three channels first the declining working age population effectively increases capital stock per person lowers the marginal product of capital decreases demand for capital and reduces the investment rate second higher life expectancy increases the stock of capital as individuals need to save more for longer in order to meet their cash flow requirements for retirement this could be further exacerbated by low interest rates because at the individual level the saving rate must increase to meet the set financial goals if real rates are close to zero or even negative finally increasing the share of old people in society reduces the stock of capital as retirees spend their savings to support their lifestyles c carvalho a ferrero and f nechio 2016 overall analysis shows that interest rates could already be depressed by as much as one pp due to ageing claus brand marcin bielecki and adrian penalver et al 2018 and could decline by a further 0 5 to 1 pp by 2030 andrea papetti 2019 currently the first two channels are stronger however the strength of the third channel should grow over time as the proportion of retirees increases sufficiently to reverse the saver dissaver dynamic andrea papetti 2019 the risk preference of savers is also an important determinant of natural interest if savers become more conservative in their risk appetite the demand for risk free assets increases and therefore pushes down on the natural real interest rate and vice versa if the risk appetite increases they are willing to lend to companies demanding a lower risk premium the preference of risk can be both trend and cyclical in ageing societies the risk appetite typically decreases as savers are more inclined to engage in wealth preservation as opposed to wealth growth strategies the business cycle also affects risk preferences the negative shocks of economic crises can induce strong rapid risk off sentiment that pushes the natural interest rate down in the short term potential growth is one of the main determinants of r it defines the possible aggregate return in the real economy and thus defines one side of the equation trend growth has been declining in advanced economies for the past several decades together with inflation and interest rates potential growth mainly depends on labour supply and quality capital deepening and total factor productivity an umbrella term for improvements in technology organisation legislature etc typically as advanced economies reach the steady state total factor productivity is the main source of sustainable growth where is the natural rate headed demographic trends are inert and can be predicted fairly accurately there are many different opinions as to how trend growth could develop over time negative demographic trends weigh on potential growth and there are worries that japan like levels of 0 5 percent trend growth are the future of europe on the other hand a lot of industries are facing disruption from 5g wireless technology and the industrial revolution 4 0 much infrastructure investment will be needed to meet environmental goals that will require large scale investment as old capital stock becomes obsolete trends such as the onshoring of manufacturing could boost the productivity of ageing europe and the robotisation of the economy could make trend growth less dependent on demographic trends in order to illustrate how the natural rate could develop a simple vector autoregressive model was constructed for some scenario analyses purposes the model is simply an illustration of how demographics and trend growth affect r leaving aside other important determinants of interest rates such as changing risk appetite and fiscal policy a federal reserve bank of new york natural rate of interest is estimated using the holston laubach and williams 2017 model the savings rate and investment rate are used as endogenous variables while demographic trends and potential growth are imposed exogenously the model analyses how the variables moved together historically endogenous variables are determined within the model trend growth acts as a shock and stays constant determining the level of the interest rate demographic projections determine the shape of the curve overall according to our analysis due to the demographic changes the natural rate of interest would be expected to decline by about one pp by 2030 the rate gradually starts to recover as the decline in the working age population and growth of retirees slows a dynamic consistent with other recent studies claus brand marcin bielecki and adrian penalver et al 2018 a lot of uncertainty shrouds these estimates because the ageing phenomenon currently observed in advanced economies is unprecedented historically if the trend growth in the euro area remains similar to today s r will likely be negative for a prolonged period of time and provide a serious challenge for the european central bank ecb if a positive scenario were to unfold and potential growth due to gains in productivity moves closer to 2 percent then r would be expected to be in the range of 1 to 2 percent in the upcoming decades if a true japanification of the euro area were to happen the natural rate of interest would sit deeply below the lower bound at around 2 to 3 percent while demographics definitely is a major factor in the development of interest rates the demand side is equally important the scenario analysis estimates show that if the euro area s potential growth trends up to 2 percent interest rates could be a full two pp higher by 2030 what does this mean for policy if the scenarios in which the natural rate of interest goes into the negative zone for a prolonged time materialise a very serious challenge presents itself to the ecb cutting rates deeper into negative territory sufficiently to close the output gap would bring severe costs to the banking sector as negative rates can rarely be passed to depositors insurance companies and pensions funds future pensioners more precisely and could provoke a political backlash thus it is probably unfeasible this would leave the ecb with only unconventional policy measures but the effect of these on r is unclear one school of thought argues that quantitative easing qe and other measures help push effective policy rates deeper into the negative this increases the difference between the real natural rate and the policy rate and should help to close the output gap faster and therefore raise the natural interest rate higher in the medium term claus brand marcin bielecki and adrian penalver et al 2018 p benigno g eggertsson and f romei 2014 meanwhile argue that unconventional policy raises the natural rate through increased leverage over time on the other hand qe could create a scarcity of safe assets push their prices up and yields down and depress the natural rate even further and again exacerbate all of the aforementioned problems andrew filardo and jouchi nakajima 2018 in addition further innovation in monetary policy cannot be ruled out central banks could devise new policy measures if the need arises to address the situation however the bottom line is that most of the factors that determine the natural rate of interest lie outside of the jurisdiction of central banks productivity enhancing reforms that incentivise innovation and encourage labour market participation and investments in productive infrastructure can have a large influence on rates an increase in the retirement age or even encouragement to participate in the labour market and delay retirement must also be considered usually this is discussed from the perspective of the sustainability of public finances but it also affects interest rates a shorter length of retirement would mean reducing the need for saving and with excess savings reduced equilibrium rates would likely move up references
executive summary the nasdaq 100 had its best year since 2009 cementing an historic ten years of outperformance the 2019 rebound included strong performances across nearly all sectors and market caps global exchanges rebounded from an abysmal 2018 aided by a new wave of central bank easing three rate cuts new repo programs and a new 60b treasury bill purchase program qe4 lite helped reduce stresses in short term funding markets and unwind the inverted yield curve global trade wars and social unrest were widespread but equities were strong nonetheless it is said all bull markets climb their own wall of worry and 2019 proved that to be the case more so than any other year in modern times headwinds were strong across the global landscape including a weak global economy and manufacturing recession flat to negative corporate earnings yield curve inversion and recession risk elevated geopolitical risks and social unrest volatile and unresolved trade wars and monetary policy uncertainty just to name a few on december 18th the house of representatives impeached the president of the united states but stocks continued to hit new daily highs in december and u s equities plowed ahead for their best year since 2013 driven by a resilient u s consumer and arguably more importantly a dovish pivot by the federal reserve for the nasdaq 100 it was its best year since 2009 despite a record government shutdown 35 days ending on january 25th january was the stock market s best month in 2019 as equities were then rebounding from one of the worst decembers on record and a 20 decline in the s p500 in q4 18 the u s china trade war was the biggest story of the year and regular changes to its expected outcome added volatility to the markets the rhetoric and fear hit extremes in early august when trump responded to a hawkish rate cut by threatening to impose 10 tariffs on an additional 300b in chinese goods equities reacted with a relatively modest pullback but rates crashed and the long end of the curve saw its second biggest monthly decline in ten years in the fall expectations rose for a watered down phase one deal which is now expected to be signed on january 15th mixed in throughout the year were tariff threats against mexico brazil and argentina president trump largely stifled the tariff rhetoric when it came to europe but that tweetstorm could come in 2020 social and political unrest were common throughout the year in september saudi arabia s oil and refining facilities were attacked by a string of drones and missiles leading to the largest ever one day percentage gain in crude oil anti government demonstrations erupted across the globe with citizens protesting various forms of taxation human rights and corruption however the protests in hong kong drew the greatest interest leading the u s to pass human rights legislation risks of a no deal brexit declined in december after uk prime minister boris johnson won the december 12th election britain s departure from the eu has been delayed three times but it could now be on course to leave by the end of january if trade wars were the biggest story for 2019 the federal reserve was a close second after repeated hawkish commentary throughout q4 18 contributed to the largest s p 500 correction since the 2008 financial crisis chairman powell did an about face i e dovish pivot in early january by essentially saying the balance sheet reduction program was no longer on auto pilot in the ensuing months the increasing trade war rhetoric falling inflation expectations weakening economic data and curve inversion drove the fed into a mid cycle adjustment of three 25bps rate cuts in as many meetings commencing on july 31st literally days before the second meeting in september the fed lost control of the short term funding markets as overnight repos ballooned to ten percentage points and the fed funds rate rocketed 75 bps above the top end of the 2 2 25 target range temporary repo facilities and a 60b monthly treasury bill purchase plan were quickly implemented and the government s balance sheet rose 11 from its low of 3 76t on 8 28 to 4 17t in late december so much for auto pilot powell made it clear the bill purchases were not qe but with roughly 6t 7t of paper that needs to be rolled every six months some speculate this is the start of qe4 which in time may require the purchases of longer dated maturities if the message was not yet received the fed s dovish pivot was cemented in q4 when powell said the committee would need to see persistent inflation above the 2 level before even considering a change to short term rates corporate earnings faced tough 2018 comps and the s p 500 is fresh off three straight quarters of negative earnings growth according to factset corporate earnings are expected to grow just 0 3 in fy 2019 economic data has been mixed but overall the economy seems to be holding on while ism manufacturing pmi came in below 50 over its last four readings from august through november services has held up strong averaging 55 5 for all of 2019 unemployment is at 50 year lows and wages are rising at or above 3 while businesses may have pulled back on spending and investment due in part to trade uncertainty the u s consumer has been resilient and just registered the biggest holiday spending on record market performance the nasdaq 100 and nasdaq composite led all major u s equity indices in 2019 by a healthy margin with gains of 38 and 35 2 the next best performers were the s p 500 28 9 r3000 28 5 and s p 400 midcap indices 24 1 the dow jones industrials and russell microcap indices finished at the back of the pack with gains of 22 3 and 21 0 ytd while the overall breadth and participation was broad the small cap russell 2000 and russell microcap indices remain roughly 4 and 9 below their 2018 highs in 2019 the nasdaq 100 ndx outperformed the flagship s p 500 by an impressive 9 1 percentage points however this type of alpha is not a one off 2019 marks the third time in five years the ndx has outperformed the spx by at least nine percentage points over the last decade the performance of nasdaq listed companies has been even more impressive since 2009 the ndx has outperformed the spx in ten of eleven years since 2010 the ndx and nasdaq composite indices have a total return of 425 and 347 respectively for comparison the s p 500 and dow jones industrials registered total returns of 256 and 252 put another way the ndx outperformed its large cap brethren by 170 and 174 percentage points over the last ten years underneath the hood most sectors performed well on both an absolute and relative basis technology 48 had its best year since 2009 while on the opposite end of the spectrum it was energy 7 6 which came in last of the eleven gics sectors for the second year in a row excluding the top tech and worst energy performers the remaining nine gics sectors had an average return of 24 9 on a relative basis healthcare 18 7 underperformed however it gained an impressive 13 9 in q4 and let s not forget it was the top performer in 2018 and over the last two years combined healthcare s total return ranks 3rd out of the eleven gics sectors rates commodities the dollar treasury bonds had their best rally since 2014 as global flows sought safe havens due to continued weakness in the global economy uncertainty from trade wars and a new round of easing by global central banks the ust 2yr yield declined 92bps yoy and with it ended a streak of seven consecutive years in the green the ust 10yr declined 77bps yoy for its biggest drop since 2014 the fed s three rate cuts help to reverse a deeply inverted yield curve the below chart illustrates the widening of the curve from 6 30 19 red compared to the current slope green the bloomberg commodity index bcom gained 4 9 in december and finished the year with a relatively modest 5 4 return after declining 24 8 in 2018 wti crude rebounded for a gain of 34 5 spot gold gained 18 3 for its best year since 2010 while copper rebounded over the final four months to finish with a modest gain of 6 3 the u s dollar index dxy gained a modest 0 2 despite the heavily weighted 58 eurusd pair declining 2 2 the jp morgan asian dollar index adxy declined 0 2 while the greenback s moves were relatively modest the technical setup in the eurusd currency pair deserves our attention going forward the narrow trading throughout most of 2019 has created extreme volatility compression this can be measured by the spread between the upper and lower bollinger bands weekly 20 2 2 which reached a 40 year low in q1 19 and remains close to those levels today more recently in late november the weekly average true range atr reached a 23 year low both indicators are capturing the extreme volatility squeeze underway for quite some time now john bollinger notes periods of low volatility are eventually followed by periods of high volatility high volatility does not indicate direction but it does indicate a powerful move therefore an extreme low in volatility can foreshadow a meaningful advance or decline in price global exchanges rebounded from an abysmal 2018 due in part to a lackluster dollar and an easing fed which helped improve dollar liquidity for the rest of the globe the era of negative rates in europe appears to have reached exhaustion and there is hope new ecb president christine lagarde will steer the region towards a different path of easing measures to the benefit of the banking system the de escalation in the u s china trade war also contributed to a rebound in global sentiment and asset prices looking ahead just three days into 2020 and the existing list of concerns are already growing on the economic front the just released ism manufacturing data for december posted its lowest reading since 2009 and suggests the slowdown in the u s economy may not entirely be in the rearview mirror the u s responded firmly to last week s attacks on its iraqi embassy with targeted missile strikes killing a senior iranian military officer while a phase one trade deal is expected in the coming days a new front with europe is expected to open later this year the latest headlines remind us that the unforeseen is a risk when looking forward still geopolitics and u s domestic politics have largely been a sideshow as far as u s equity markets have been concerned even with these new risks and probably a few more to develop most investment firms polled believe that the global economic recovery will continue in 2020 central banks renewed accommodative monetary policy support and resilience in consumer spending should help grow corporate earnings fueling economic growth this year the fed trade the economy and corporate earnings in roughly that order have largely been the driver of market gains in 2019 and developments in these areas with some geopolitics thrown in will be

reading time 3 minutes la paz in 2019 bolivia s political institutions were put to the test in the new year it may be the economy s turn many are hoping elections slated for may will help quell the turmoil that erupted after last year s disputed presidential election and subsequent resignation of president evo morales if the country can regain political stability and consensus the next government will have to quickly address an increasingly complicated economy one strained by high deficits low reserves and an overdependence on primary commodity exports jeanine áñez the senator who replaced morales as the country s interim president in november heads a caretaker government whose main mandate is to conduct new democratic elections smoothly but in addition to this main goal she also must ensure macroeconomic stability until the next administration takes office and macroeconomic stability is a difficult challenge at a time when hydrocarbons output bolivia s main export is falling due to both a depletion of existing reserves and reduced purchases from its main buyers brazil and argentina the bolivian economy is particularly vulnerable to exogenous shocks and resilience must be built however the transitory nature of áñez s presidency is in a way a straitjacket she doesn t have the time or the mandate to undo the main reforms of morales government however necessary that may be toward weathering the coming storm thus the new government to be elected in may will quickly face very difficult decisions concerning the economy from an overvalued exchange rate to adjusting domestic prices of heavily subsidized fuels the next administration will face several stumbling blocks more broadly bolivia s next president will have to take actions to narrow the fiscal deficit and to redress the external accounts at first morales economic legacy seems impressive from 2006 the year he took office through 2018 gdp growth averaged 4 9 according to world bank data annual inflation meanwhile averaged 5 5 accumulated international reserves reached 15 billion or close to 50 of gdp in 2014 as important the percentage of people living in poverty declined from 59 6 in 2005 to 36 4 in 2017 and inequality measured by the gini index fell from 58 5 to 44 0 yet despite these good numbers bolivia s long term development problems remain or even worsened and the country s insertion into the international economy is still a distant reality to understand the complicated panorama facing the next government we have to look back at morales first term which began during the decade long export boom that overlapped with his administration and influenced his non conventional economic policies the long cycle of high export prices followed important findings of natural gas privatizations and changes in the tax legislation done in the 1990s the windfall income that bolivia received out of the improvements in its terms of trade amounted in some years to a huge 8 of gdp the export boom aided a fast increase in deposits in the banking system which in turn contributed to a surge in financing of residential construction since construction is very labor intensive open unemployment dropped the informal labor sector also expanded though for different reasons more than morales own policies high rates of economic growth helped improve social progress indicators behind the positive trend however a number of issues persisted which may have kept the bolivian economy from doing even better than it did namely there was little diversification of exports and production under morales in fact exports became more concentrated than ever in hydrocarbons metals and grains worse the spike in income was not invested at all in institutional strengthening on the contrary crucial institutions like checks and balances rule of law and the independence of the central bank were severely impaired property rights were weakened and the private sector was treated with extreme ambiguity despite morales anti market policies which included nationalizations and a significant expansion of state owned enterprises he executed his policies with some caution which helped bolivia avoid the kind of pain experienced by its neighbors when the commodities boom ended in 2014 still the country s loss of export income was as high as 40 in 2015 in the subsequent years the situation improved modestly morales tried to prolong the effects of the export bonanza by pushing public investment driving up the fiscal deficit which has been close to 7 5 of gdp since 2015 the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments in the same period was also very large at over 5 of gdp on average these twin deficits have been financed by depleting bolivia s international reserves which in october 2019 was at half of its peak value reached in 2014 and by some modest increase in external debt notwithstanding the difficulties mentioned above a reasonable rate of gdp growth above the latin american average can still be attained in 2020 it will require the private sector responding strongly to an expected improvement in business climate with less policy constraints on private sector initiatives and investment the bolivian economy can grow become diversified and ensure equity but first the reestablishment of confidence is crucial this depends very much on the handling of the transition by áñez and whoever bolivians entrust to lead the country come may morales was the president of bolivia s central bank from 1996 to 2006 he is currently a professor of economics at the catholic university of bolivia

sydney and kuala lumpur jan 07 ips the latest november 2019 ubs pwc billionaires report counted 2 101 billionaires globally or 589 more than five years before earlier farhad manjoo had seriously recommended abolish billionaires presenting a moral case against the super rich as they have and get far far more than what they might reasonably claim to deserve anis chowdhury manjoo also argues that unless billionaires economic and political power is cut and their legitimacy cast in doubt they will continue to abuse power to further augment their fortunes and influence in ways detrimental to the economic social and public good benign billionaires in defence of billionaires josef stadler head of ultra high net worth at ubs global wealth management argued that their wealth has also translated into their philanthropy as billionaires seek new ways to engineer far reaching environmental and social change philanthropic ethics expert chiara cordelli notes that philanthropy and donations have diverted social responsibility from governments and created other problems by bypassing democratic political processes and accountability the philanthropist should not get to decide in virtue of her or his disproportionate influence which world we should live in an ostensibly benign billionaire effect cannot offset the adverse impacts of billionaires wealth accumulation tax avoidance and abuse of power to corrupt political processes and policy making rather every billionaire should be regarded as a policy failure to create fairer societies we need to end extreme wealth concentration and its problematic consequences dubious sources robert reich has shown that a significant share of billionaires wealth is undeserved and does not bear any reasonable connection to their ability intelligence or contribution as expected in a society supposedly based on meritocracy and fair competition oxfam estimates that about a third of billionaire wealth is inherited there is no real economic case for inherited wealth as it undermines social mobility economic progress and meritocracy the main basis of legitimation in modern society other work finds that about 43 per cent of billionaire wealth comes from crony connections to governments and monopolies e g when billionaires use such connections and corruption to secure government concessions and contracts jomo kwame sundaram in developing countries this share was even higher 56 per cent according to a 2015 oxfam study the economist s crony capitalism index also suggests that corruption and crony connections to governments are behind much billionaire wealth another source of billionaire wealth is abuse of monopoly privileges granted by patent laws while intellectual property has been justified as necessary for innovation recent research summarized by the the economist disputes the supposed link between patent rights and innovation and deems the patent system a dysfunctional way to reward innovation or new ideas since the 1980s patent rights have been extended well beyond what may be considered necessary to incentivize innovation for richard posner a respected us judge such extensions offer almost no incentive for creating additional intellectual property insider trading taking advantage of privileged information not yet made public has been significantly abused for unfair advantage in markets the new york times has found some of the most prominent cases of illegal insider dealings have involved very wealthy people growing wealth concentration a large and growing share of the global economy is controlled by a few large transnational corporations tncs decades of mergers acquisitions and ineffectual anti trust legislation have seen market power concentrated despite claims to the contrary such tncs cartels other monopolies and oligopolies extract lucrative rents enabling them to secure super profits accelerating wealth accumulation and concentration at the expense of petty producers workers and consumers the way wealth is used by the super rich confirms their own social disutility they accumulate more quickly by paying as little tax as possible making good use of tax advisers and havens a study found that the super rich pay as much as 30 less tax than they should denying governments billions in lost tax revenue the extremely wealthy also get the best investment and tax evasion advice enabling billionaire wealth to increase by an average of 11 annually since 2009 far more than average investors and ordinary savers get dark money corrupts societies the secretive society of trust and estate practitioners step representing over 20 000 wealth managers has successfully lobbied many governments to reduce taxes on the richest step has spent billions to buy legal impunity politicians and the media to lower taxes on its clientele such lobbying has accelerated wealth concentration and accumulation such dark money is used to influence elections and public policy the world over an oxfam study has shown how politicians have been bought by latin america s super rich e g with substantial financial backing for ethno populist racist and religiously intolerant leaders over a century ago monopoly power was seen as a major threat to the us economy and society anti trust legislation and action especially by president theodore roosevelt broke up cartels and monopolies years later his cousin president franklin delano roosevelt warned government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organised mob neoliberalism oversold however in recent decades neoliberal economists have taken a much more benign view of oligopolies and monopolies distinguishing them from classical liberal economists committed to market competition conversely insisting on competition in small developing economies has effectively prevented domestic firms from becoming internationally competitive by building on economies of scale and scope significantly even the international monetary fund which imposed neoliberal policies for nearly four decades as a condition for credit support now accepts that neoliberalism was oversold while the world bank acknowledges disappointing growth after neoliberal reform deregulation liberalization privatization and globalization have strengthened the market power of corporations reduced the progressivity of tax systems reduced public provisioning increased the frequency and intensity of financial crises and slowed growth and development
in recent years public universities have faced a troubling question can they remain financially solvent while serving their own residents at the low tuition rates that were common several decades ago in other words can they have their cake and eat it too a recent survey of flagship state universities conducted by the washington post concludes that the answer is probably no among the 50 state universities surveyed 44 have experienced a decrease in their percentage of in state students in the past decade just 51 of the students at the university of michigan in fall 2016 were actually michigan residents down 13 percentage points from 10 years before with the continuing decline in legislative appropriations for higher education public universities are trying to fill the gap by recruiting higher paying out of state students this is part of a frantic effort by public universities around the country to sustain a financial model they inherited from the 1950s and 1960s that model relied upon generous state appropriations to subsidize low cost tuition for qualified state residents while allowing a minority of out of state students to matriculate at inflated rates it was common across the country for state governments to provide well over half of university budgets through annual legislative appropriations with the remainder covered by tuition gifts and various grants at that time few private institutions could match the range of research programs offered at flagship state institutions particularly in costly fields like engineering and the sciences out of state students willing to pay premium tuition widely pursued admission to these schools with enrollments in excess of 25 000 and in some cases 40 000 these universities dwarfed private schools in scale but offered a great deal of educational bang for the buck public institutions such as the university of california the university of michigan and the university of wisconsin held their own against competition from harvard yale princeton stanford and other elite private institutions flagship universities in illinois minnesota north carolina and virginia also earned high rankings degrees from those schools were judged as equivalent or even superior to degrees from the top private universities it is clear in retrospect that the early post war decades represented the heyday of public higher education in the united states during this period flagship universities had few rivals for state funds and with their alumni well represented in the legislatures and the baby boom generation headed off to college they were well positioned to demand a rising share of state budgets across the nation nearly 20 of state budgets flowed into public universities at a time when state funded pensions health care and k 12 education were relatively inexpensive the post war political environment favored generous investments in elite public educational institutions which encouraged an increased share of 18 year olds to enroll in state schools and attracted some of the most able young americans to college teaching that model has gradually come apart new realities of state budgeting combined with demographic changes the growing costs of higher education and the increasing demand for college and university services in a high tech economy have made mid century funding levels unsustainable public universities have also invested heavily in brick and mortar infrastructure for decades investments that are increasingly less valuable as the shift toward online education continues apace in order to flourish public universities will need to acknowledge the new educational landscape and initiate bold reforms they can do this by among other things appealing to demographics beyond the 18 year old cohort they have traditionally recruited and by restructuring some of the administrative and academic models that have developed since the 1950s state schools must also let go of certain long held habits and notions about the role of public universities changing budgets as recently as 1987 the state of california provided roughly 50 of the total budgets for the university of california s berkeley and los angeles campuses by 2012 the proportions at both institutions were down to 22 in 1987 the university of virginia received 37 of its budget from the state in 2012 that figure had fallen to 14 a similar pattern exists in states around the country the gradual withdrawal of public support from flagship universities has sent academic leaders frantically searching for funds via higher tuition for state residents recruitment of foreign and out of state students government contracts and private donations the collapse of the old model is also taking a toll on the quality of education offered at these schools public institutions are losing top faculty to wealthy private colleges and universities that can afford to pay higher salaries while the best high school graduates pursue admission to private schools at the expense of public institutions by and large top private colleges and universities have surpassed public institutions in academic and research quality for example only one public university was listed among the top 20 schools in the 2020 rankings of major academic institutions by u s news world report and just six public universities are ranked among the top 30 institutions in the nation these public institutions are outranked not only by traditionally elite private schools like harvard princeton and yale but also by institutions such as vanderbilt northwestern and duke which have surged into the top tier of american research universities in recent decades this reversal in fortunes between the nation s public and private institutions was never anticipated during the higher education boom of the 1950s and 1960s and is only now being recognized as a national problem in need of dramatic and creative solutions so what happened over the last four or five decades to reverse the momentum in higher education from public to private institutions the answer lies in a fairly straightforward mix of political and financial factors that have squeezed public institutions while leaving private institutions free to exploit new developments in the american political economy such as the stock market boom of recent decades state universities rely upon two main revenue sources to finance undergraduate education state appropriations and student tuition it was not uncommon during the 50s and 60s for state appropriations to cover up to 80 of the costs of flagship universities with the bulk of the remaining funds coming from tuition which was heavily subsidized for in state students today after decades of attrition state appropriations cover on average only about 30 of those costs in some cases as at the university of michigan and the university of virginia state appropriations cover less than 15 of total costs to the point where it may no longer make sense to describe these as public institutions some have attributed this shift to nefarious motives on the part of legislators bent on cutting higher education budgets a recent article by the atlantic s senior editor ronald brownstein suggests that institutional racism may be to blame noting that the increase in racial minorities attending public colleges has correlated with higher tuition this historic shift away from tax dollars funding the bulk of public higher education comes precisely as the nation s youth population is more racially diverse than ever the real explanation though is not so simple or so malevolent declining state appropriations are due to at least three major trends that cannot be easily reversed first and perhaps most important states are faced with increased budgetary pressures since the heyday of public universities in the 1950s and 60s state governments have taken on more fiscal responsibilities squeezing the funds available for higher education today states must finance the rising costs of medicaid welfare k 12 education and public employee pension funds all of which are protected by powerful advocacy and voting groups a study by the american academy of arts and sciences found that due to mandatory spending programs and other pressures states are often forced to make painful cuts elsewhere as a result between 2008 and 2013 states cut appropriation support per fte student in the median public research university by more than 26 percent according to research published by douglas webber in education next state and local public welfare spending is easily the dominant factor driving budget decisions with a 1 increase per capita spending associated with a 2 44 decrease in per student higher education funding enough to explain the entire average national decline in other words public higher education has suffered from crowding out as new items backed by powerful interest groups vie for limited state funds in response to these cuts public universities have increased tuition on average by some 37 since 2008 several states including alabama arizona california colorado georgia and hawaii have increased rates by over 60 louisiana more than doubled its price tag tuition now provides nearly half of all revenues for public institutions across the country up from around 35 in 2008 and 25 in 1989 this suggests that the increases reflect a long term trend in the financing of public education rather than a short term response to the great recession of 2008 as the u s economy has recovered in recent years some states have begun to increase appropriations for higher education albeit at modest levels of less than 5 per year according to a survey released earlier this year by the illinois state university s center for the study of education policy and the state higher education executive officers association state funding for public higher education across the country increased by 1 6 for the last fiscal year the lowest level of growth in five years despite this modest growth in appropriations state funding for public universities in real terms remains well below its 2008 level even as student enrollments have increased james palmer the survey s editor explained that this is the consequence of many factors including political decisions to decrease or not raise taxes downturns in certain sectors that state economies or the need to direct tax revenue to address underfunded pension obligations second student loans have played a role in altering public university budgets while the rise in tuition rates has begun to slow a bit from its rapid rise in the 90s and early 2000s student borrowing has continued apace a 2014 report from the cleveland federal reserve bank began by listing three salient facts total student loan debt outstanding has quadrupled since 2003 student debt now exceeds all other forms of consumer debt even credit cards student debt has the highest delinquency rate of any consumer loan category state colleges and universities have been counting not only on real tuition dollars but on federally subsidized debt for some time now these figures suggest that even if state appropriations had remained constant these institutions would still have sought more funds to meet their ever expanding budgets in a bid to remain competitive with private universities third relationships between school administrators and state legislatures appear to have shifted in recent years mitch daniels the president of purdue university and former governor of indiana argues that many universities complaining about budget cuts are partly responsible for their poor financial situation noting that some schools have stockpiled dollars and the legislatures figured that out while there are sometimes good reasons to save for a rainy day daniels who has been on both sides of the negotiating table notes that legislatures will often decline budget requests if schools don t really seem to need the money and if state legislatures take a skeptical attitude toward university administrators requests for more funds the administrators often shoulder some of the blame schools have not conducted themselves in a way that inspires confidence says daniels citing as an example the university of missouri s recent decline in enrollment following the administration s questionable conduct during campus protests in 2015 according to the center on budget and policy priorities states reduced spending on public higher education by 16 between the 2008 recession and 2017 but these national averages mask some real differences among states arizona for instance cut its higher education budget by 54 between 2008 and 2017 indiana managed to slightly increase its spending during that time by 0 2 per student daniels explained that his state has been fortunate and that in some other states you d think it was a misprint how much their higher education budget has been cut not all public universities are equal and the relationships between individual schools and state legislatures can matter a great deal the evolving college reality beyond budgetary battles state schools must also contend with changing demographics and the new demands on higher education that come along with a high tech economy as michael crow president of arizona state university put it public colleges have inherited a public social infrastructure investment system that is completely inadequate in the early 20th century local governments began to pay for k 12 education but no one considered it a scandal if a quarter of the students dropped out before graduation not everyone needed a high school education it was assumed that only about 5 of high school graduates would move ahead to college or university at that level of demand state governments had little trouble funding public higher education the costs were not prohibitive just a few public institutions operated in each state and most had modest enrollments there were also fewer competitors for state funds since then the number of students who feel they must receive advanced education has risen exponentially these feelings are justified according to crow at least 90 of american students must graduate from high school and more than 60 will need to attain some degree or certificate after that in order for the united states to remain competitive for example 70 of koreans aged 25 to 34 have a college degree compared to 49 of americans in that age group yet while this drive toward increasing educational achievement may seem like a positive trend many aspiring college students do not fit the traditional mold of an 18 year old seeking a four year residential experience and that population of traditional students is actually shrinking as mitch daniels noted we re not making enough babies this has put many schools in a bit of a fix as colleges and universities expanded for years to accommodate greater numbers of such students following the baby boom era there are other forces reshaping the student body too as thomas lindsay the director of the center for innovation in education at the texas public policy foundation notes the new majority of college students are over 25 working full time with a family of their own to support only around 20 of college students are in the 18 22 age group and enrolled in a four year program the remaining 80 of students need different kinds of institutional support currently around 36 million americans have spent some time in college but left without attaining a degree daniels has argued that these less conventional students present an opportunity and a duty for public universities who wish to both provide a service and remain competitive arizona state university has attempted to rise to this challenge among other innovations aimed at helping unconventional students asu launched a partnership with starbucks in 2014 to offer free tuition to employees who work an average of at least 20 hours a week around 2 000 employees in the program have received degrees so far another way to respond to decreasing numbers of traditional four year students is to offer more flexible online education options according to lindsay taking classes online and working toward some competency based degree is the new ticket to the american dream online courses can also reduce costs for public universities though most have only just begun to realize those gains for long established brick and mortar schools it may not seem like enough to make up for immediate budget shortfalls to do so universities have opted to raise tuition but residents understandably object to subsidizing a university through tax dollars while also being charged high tuition that is the higher education dilemma in a nutshell colleges are losing state appropriations but cannot increase tuition sufficiently to make up for the losses in some cases the same legislatures that cut appropriations have also mandated ceilings on tuition increases states have also taken to admitting more out of state or foreign students who can be charged much higher tuition that may help in the short run though education officials have faced backlash from state residents complaining that these students are taking slots that should be reserved for in state students moreover this is often a devil s bargain for public institutions since the bells and whistles that schools need to attract such students lavish dormitories upscale cafeterias top of the line recreation facilities are usually costly if non resident students are going to receive tuition bills comparable to those at highly ranked private institutions they are bound to ask for corresponding amenities at the same time state universities are providing reduced tuition for some outstanding non resident students in order to improve the overall reputation of their institutions while it cuts into revenues school officials hope that it will enable them to recruit good faculty attract more research grants and philanthropic donations and garner more applications from high performing out of state students willing to pay full tuition it is a gamble with unclear odds of success other schools are increasingly relying on private philanthropy which mitch daniels has argued is a poor long term solution since much of the money that is raised goes either for a donor s particular interest which is often not at the top of a university s priority list or to brand new initiatives such donations don t do anything to reduce the current cost structure and even if a school can persuade philanthropists to give large donations and professors can be pushed to increase revenues through research grants or partnerships the inflow of funds available through these avenues will not be large enough to make a dent in the institutional bottom line moreover it is not uncommon to hear some faculty and administrators complain that universities chasing these dollars are making schools ever more like businesses or that corporatizing higher education compromises academic freedom in spring 2018 for example the montana state university faculty voted to turn down 5 7 million from the charles koch foundation a decision made on the basis of political and ideological considerations given the changing look and feel of higher education public universities must find new solutions to their financial problems new debates new solutions so what are university administrators to do some are hoping for tax increases to augment the flow of funds into their institutions though they realize that those additional funds are likely to be gobbled up by other state priorities this strategy may be doomed from the start as richard vedder of the center for college affordability and productivity notes state and local tax rates have remained steady over time with the average right around 10 of income we are remarkably close to the biblical concept of a tithe that s what people will tolerate anytime it nudges up too far above that you get a revolt reduced tuition for in state residents has long been a middle class entitlement taken for granted by taxpayers and hopeful students yet it is also a lottery of sorts since most residents even those with children will never be able to take advantage of it their children may not go to college or they may not be admitted to a competitive state university especially one focused on recruiting out of state students as this reality sinks in fewer members of the middle class will vote to send their tax dollars to these institutions there are a few steps that state governments and public universities can take to address these challenges first it would help if state legislatures cut governmental strings and let schools experiment with new models of delivery to compensate for reduced appropriations arizona state university for example has successfully launched online education systems restructured departments and implemented other innovations to assist working students in 2019 asu s tempe campus was ranked the most innovative school in the country by u s news world report ahead of mit and stanford for the fifth straight year in part because of its dedication to encouraging unconventional students to get ahead and allowing all students to customize their education for example students can choose between 7 5 week or 15 week semesters qualified uber drivers are offered a pathway to a fully funded college degree through asu s online system asu president michael crow explained that the university s willingness to try new ideas is not a casual thing but something intentionally built into the fabric of the institution schools can also slash administrative costs as daniels has done at purdue without diminishing the quality of academic instruction according to a joint analysis by the american institutes for research and the new england center of investigative reporting administration has been the fastest growing item in college and university budgets having increased by more than 50 between 1987 and 2011 andrew gillen a senior researcher at the institutes reported a mind boggling amount of money per student that s being spent on administration though some college presidents have vowed to cut costs many policy experts doubt their sincerity according to vedder they ll say we re making moves to cut costs and mention something about energy efficient lightbulbs and ignore the new assistant to the assistant to the associate vice provost they just hired if universities are serious about cutting costs they can start with their bloated administrations similarly it is past time to start cutting some academic departments the proliferation of new areas of study particularly in the humanities and the social sciences has contributed to excess administration courses with low enrollments and many undergraduate and doctoral degrees that offer little value after graduation since 2009 arizona state university has shuttered dozens of departments combining some into larger disciplines reformers also frequently stress the importance of getting students in and out of college more quickly the texas public policy foundation for example has championed the 10 000 bachelor s degree in which general education requirements can be completed online and students can get credits for achieving competency rather than just completing the target amount of seat time getting students through college in three years has also been a major goal for daniels at purdue so far about 5 of students are enrolled in such abbreviated programs which can save money for both students and universities daniels has called the four year degree an american idiosyncrasy under his leadership purdue is seeking to incentivize summer study to speed things up after all he notes very few businesses shut down for 22 of the year michael crow too has argued that his university s goal should be to move students through as quickly as possible last universities can adapt their academic calendars to the changing needs of today s students by experimenting with longer semesters shorter vacations and classes that are held on more than four days out of the week and at a wider range of times and if students are going to stay for four years they should be able to get a second degree in a foreign language for instance many motivated students have also taken advantage of the proliferation of honors colleges at public universities which are not terribly expensive to operate but provide a level of education on par with those of elite private schools reforming for the future as valuable as these reforms are however they will not be enough to entirely curtail the financial pressures on public universities there is simply too much higher education infrastructure in some states often as a result of political decisions rather than educational ones vedder notes that detroit alone has five different public colleges and could save some money by merging institutions daniels has consolidated two local campuses giving them one administration one chancellor one provost one admissions office something even more radical may be warranted if states still want to incentivize students to go to college they might consider offering vouchers such as those provided by the g i bill in which higher education funds would be sent directly to deserving students rather than to public institutions the vouchers could even be means tested since wealthier students already have the resources to attend college vouchers could be limited to in state universities or states could arrange among themselves whether to accept one another s vouchers vedder suggests developing interstate compacts so that states with smaller populations and larger education infrastructures can enroll more students from states with bigger populations and smaller infrastructures vedder has also suggested that state universities particularly elite ones could consider privatizing the state of pennsylvania already has different categories of public support for schools pennsylvania state university for instance is categorized as a state related university along with temple university and the university of pittsburgh this means it is neither a public nor private institution unlike the 14 state owned higher education schools in pennsylvania while all state owned schools have the same in state tuition costs penn state merely receives an annual appropriation and can set its own tuition and fees whereas in 1970 the government funded 62 of the budget it now supplies only 14 by privatizing schools that receive low levels of support from the government and sending higher education dollars directly to students states could potentially re invigorate their higher education institutions if flagship institutions were privatized there would certainly be less pressure on them to offer admission to in state students a potential drawback but if students were given a voucher to attend they would have the power to choose from a variety of public or private institutions in the state michael crow has asked the arizona legislature to consider this model which would make asu more like a charter school and less like a state agency vedder has also argued that because the boards of public colleges are comprised of political appointees schools often suffer many board members have little idea how to run a university and their terms are often so short that by the time they understand the basics they are out of office at the university of michigan it is arguably even worse as the board is elected by popular vote according to vedder voters don t know who they re voting for you get nincompoops privatizing universities could assist in this matter as experienced university leadership would have greater leeway in determining the structure of university boards and better boards matter as most americans still want college educations for their children and would be drawn to schools that show themselves to be good stewards of tuition dollars for all their flaws flagship public institutions in the post war era have provided hundreds of thousands of working and middle class americans with an affordable avenue of upward mobility the top 20 public universities still enroll more than three times as many students as the 20 most prestigious private institutions and in state tuition and fees at those institutions 13 500 on average in the 2019 2020 school year remain more affordable for middle class families than those at the leading private institutions 55 500 on average the great state universities are not going to disappear and many will maintain a standard of excellence but in an age of inefficient governments trying to do all things for all people they will not have the money to compete as they once did with high performing private institutions the financial model built in the post war years is no longer sustainable under present circumstances academic leaders have tried to circumvent this reality by raising tuition recruiting out of state students and employing other short term fixes that fail to address the fundamental problems at hand it is time they adapt their practices to a new and in some ways fundamentally different education marketplace james piereson is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and president and trustee of the william e simon foundation naomi schaefer

president donald trump s tax cuts have never been popular in part because so many benefits accrue to the well off turns out that big corporations and wealthy individuals weren t the only winners texas along with some other thriving states got a bigger boost that added more momentum to an already strong economy and the highest paid in texas those earning over 500 000 had a much bigger upside than high earners in the rest of the u s advertisement in other words the rich got richer especially in texas advertisement that s not surprising but the size of the impact is notable it also means that texas has even more advantages to lure potential employers and workers business briefing become a business insider with the latest news sign up or with google facebook by signing up you agree to our terms of service and privacy policy the tax cuts which were approved by a republican congress two years ago reduced total tax liabilities in the state by 2 1 in 2018 that was significantly more than the 1 4 average tax cut for the rest of the u s according to a recent report from the federal reserve bank of dallas for texas households the average tax savings totaled nearly 1 400 compared with almost 1 000 for the rest of the u s advertisement the more generous tax break in texas likely played an important role in texas 2018 stronger job growth wrote anil kumar a senior economist at the dallas fed texas added almost 300 000 jobs in 2018 leading the nation and the next closest states california and florida the tax cuts likely boosted the state s job growth by 0 3 percentage points kumar wrote advertisement while the cuts are applied uniformly the gains by state depended on several factors the tax law nearly doubled the standard deduction and texas has a higher share of residents taking that deduction 76 here vs 70 for the u s kumar said advertisement the law also capped deductions for state and local taxes and mortgage interest which affected a greater share of filers outside of texas high earners in california and new york really felt the changes he said the upshot is that more residents in texas gained more benefits than most texas ranked ninth among the 50 states in tax savings as a share of income and second among the 10 most populous states according to the dallas fed study the reason texas got such a boost in growth is because it got a bigger stimulus kumar said in a phone interview advertisement among texans earning over 500 000 in 2018 the average tax savings topped 3 of income the study said that was two to three times higher than the average savings for similar earners in the u s and it was significantly higher than the average tax cut for the middle class the high income groups in texas were hurt much less by the limitations on deductions kumar said housing prices and local tax burdens tend to be lower in texas than in many large states especially on the east and west coasts historically those cost advantages have helped attract more corporate relocations and expansions and they helped persuade more workers to come here too advertisement the tax cuts amplify texas edge especially among higher paid employees and entrepreneurs the dallas fed study focused on the short term impact of the tax cuts but much of the criticism of the law centers on its long term effects while advocates had predicted the tax cuts would spur enough economic growth to cover their costs they ve contributed to major increases in the deficit and national debt over a decade the costs of the tax cuts and jobs act will approach 2 trillion including interest according to estimates from the committee for a responsible federal budget a nonpartisan group advocating for fiscal responsibility advertisement the tax bill accomplished many desirable things said maya macguineas president of the committee it brought down corporate tax rates making business more competitive and made courageous reforms to limit deductions for state and local taxes and mortgage debt but the shortcomings of the law well outweigh the benefits she wrote in an october post because it makes the debt worse and harder to fix that has negative effects on our overall economy and well being macguineas said in a phone interview advertisement people need to recognize the trade offs she said or they re missing a big half of the picture congress didn t reduce spending to match the lower revenue from the tax cuts instead it approved large budgets that added trillions more to the debt almost half of americans disapproved of the tax cuts in a survey last march according to the pew research center but opinions were split along political lines with democrats widely opposed and most republicans approving of the law that split will make it difficult to address reforms in health and retirement programs and if some believed that higher deficits would lead to a starve the beast strategy to cut spending that calculation certainly backfired macguineas wrote advertisement tax cuts appear to have broken the dam rather than starved even a puny amount of the beast she said

assa 2020 is the annual conference of the american economics association which brings together all the various economics associations in america this year s conference in san diego california was attended by over 13 000 economists lecturers and students not just from the us but all over the world it s the biggest event in mainstream economics but also includes heterodox and marxist presentations you could tell the main themes of this year s assa from the live webcasts transmitted over the three days so let s start with those one big meeting was organised by economics for inclusive prosperity efip which is a new network of progressive mainstream economists with some big names like dani rodrick or gabriel zucman their stated aim is show that the tools of mainstream economists not only lend themselves to but are critical to the development of a policy framework for what we call inclusive prosperity while prosperity is the traditional concern of economists the inclusive modifier demands both that we consider the interest of all people not simply the average person and that we consider prosperity broadly including non pecuniary sources of well being from health to climate change to political rights so economics and economic policy should be for all sounds progressive right suresh naidu of columbia university told the audience that our societies confront serious challenges arising from uneven technological progress globalization shocks and climate change we discuss the extent to which the contemporary practice of economics is conducive to generating solutions to these problems we are cautiously optimistic that economics can be an ally of inclusive prosperity but emphasize that economists must combine their analytical and empirical tools with institutional imagination and creativity samuel bowles from the santa fe institute spoke bowles used to consider himself a marxist but those days are long gone in a recent article for vox he wrote on the legacy of marx s economic ideas in order to dismiss them in that article he agreed with keynes view that capital is an obsolete economic textbook not only scientifically erroneous but without interest or application to the modern world keynes 1925 and he agreed with the judgement of 1960s mainstream economic guru paul samuelson that from the viewpoint of pure economic theory karl marx can be regarded as a minor post ricardian and who in turn was the most overrated of economists samuelson 1962 bowles reckons that mainstream economics in particular neoclassical marginalism went on to sort out marx s failures by replacing his value theory and this has also led to dropping the idea of social ownership of the means of production to replace the capitalist mode modern public economics mechanism design and public choice theory has also challenged the notion common among many latter day marxists though not originating with marx himself that economic governance without private property and markets could be a viable system of economic governance apparently all that is left of marx s legacy is what bowles calls despotism in the workplace or the exploitive nature of capitalist production which is not due to the exploitation of labour power for surplus value but due to the power structure where moguls and managers rule the roost over the worker serfs and bowles presented this power theme to the assa audience again you see free market economics is at one pole and keynesian style government management economics is at the other but we need a third way we should explore the normative modeling and policy challenges arising if we locate policies and institutions in a two dimensional space by adding a third pole community based in important respects on social norms rather than state imposed laws or contractual exchanges for bowles inclusive economics means turning to the community then came luigi zingales from the neo classical heartland of the university of chicago he showed that quite often economists come up with theory and policy that people don t like and politicians won t implement even though it may be right to overcome these political limits to the great ideas of mainstream economics economists should help design a system that conforms to people s preferences the use of the neoclassical concept of consumer preference was telling policy based on democratic planning for social need was not zingales way thepoliticallimitsofeconomics_preview 2 the second livestream meeting was on the future of capitalism nobel prize winner and poverty expert angus deaton from princeton university introduced a galaxy of stars including raghuram rajan from the university of chicago and former head reserve bank of india and kenneth rogoff from harvard rajan is famous for warning about the risk of financial engineering causing a credit crunch at a meeting of central bankers in the early 2000s where he was dismissed by the likes of keynesian larry summers former treasury secretary under clinton rajan has also written a book with zingales called saving capitalism from the capitalists unleashing the power of financial markets to create wealth and spread opportunity in that book the authors reckon that the free market is the form of economic organization most beneficial to human society and for improving the human condition but free markets can flourish over the long run only when government plays a visible role in determining the rules that govern the market and supporting it with the proper infrastructure government however is subject to influence by organized private interests incumbent private interests therefore may be able to leverage the power of governmental regulation to protect their own economic position at the expense of the public interest by repressing the same free market through which they originally achieved success thus society must act to save capitalism from the capitalists i e take appropriate steps to protect the free market from powerful private interests who would seek to impede the efficient function of free markets entrench themselves and thereby reduce the overall level of economic opportunity in society the authors offer the following recommendations reduce incumbent capitalists incentives to oppose markets especially by limiting the concentration of ownership of productive assets provide a social safety net for the economically distressed to help maintain broad political support for free markets keep the borders of the economy open to support free trade and maintain a high level of competitive pressure on incumbent firms educate the public regarding the benefits of free markets to build political support for free market policies or more specifically oppose governmental interventions in the market designed to protect incumbents at the expense of overall economic opportunity this was broadly what rajan told the assa audience such was the progressive wing of mainstream economics at assa it aims at inclusive economics based on the assumption that market and capitalism are best but require management and the involvement of people so that they can recognise the expertise of economists in solving social problems of course added to these presentations were many on the inequality of wealth and income in modern capitalist economies and what to do about it there was a session on how gdp is no proper measure of social welfare and how to revise it with economic and social indicators that would make national output more inclusive and in another session gabriel zucman and emmanuel saez presented the results of the latest measures of wealth inequality in the us as published in their recent book their main message is that progressive taxation and a wealth tax could make real inroads on inequality but as i said in my review of their book these excellent progressive economists are seeking to redress unequal distributions created by capitalist exploitation and financial power with tax measures there is no policy for removing the market causes of inequality even those who profess to be more heterodox and radical than the mainstream progressives look only at tax and redistribution measures to reduce inequality in giving the david gordon memorial lecture at assa heather boushey reckoned that economic inequality in all its forms is obstructing subverting and distorting the pathways to strong stable and broadly shared growth it s just inequality that s in the way of making capitalism work the problem is that the innovative power of capitalism has been distorted by monopoly this was the message from progressive nobel prize winner angus deaton that we should especially pay attention when makers of public benefit innovators etc become rich and turn from makers into destroyers of public benefit via politics etc this was a reference to the rise of the big tech and online firms that have turned into super star companies that dominate their markets and the economy but is inequality the product of monopoly market power distorting competition top economist mainstream john van reenen in a presentation claimed that it was his empirical work shows that across firm inequality has increased in line with rising concentration levels within all industries even sectors as well as higher aggregate markups in us since 1980s but another group of economists saw it differently for while growth has fallen in the u s and firm concentration and profits have risen and labor s share of national income is down this is due to accelerating it advances the most efficient firms with higher markups spread into new markets thereby generating a temporary burst of growth because their efficiency is difficult to imitate less efficient firms find markets more difficult to enter profitably and therefore innovate less eventually due to greater competition from efficient firms within firm markups actually fall despite the increase in the aggregate markup and rents firm incentives to innovate decline lowering the long run growth rate so profit mark ups are really due to more efficient firms gaining advantage over less efficient another paper argued that it was both technological competition and market power that led to higher mark ups both technological change and a change in market structure are necessary to explain the observed change in markups between 1980 and 2016 we find that 2016 welfare would be 19 higher with 1980 market power is inequality of income and wealth rising because ai and robots are replacing workers one group of economists reckon that ai related invention is far more pervasive than previous analyses have suggested we find that ai related innovations are positively associated with firm growth as firms with ai related innovations have 25 faster employment growth and 40 faster revenue growth than a comparative set of firms we also find evidence that ai related innovations appear to raise output per worker and increase within firm wage inequality this sounds very much like marx s view of technological competition driving down overall profitability and eventually bringing a stop to growth in investment indeed has the labour share in national income fallen across the globe boe s sophie piton argued that correcting for housing self employment labour s share was stable in all major economies bar the us inclusive economics aims to make modern capitalist economies less unequal but it is the very process of accumulation and investment in technological competition and the concentration of economic power in a few firms that is creating inequality so making capitalism much fairer through redistribution of taxation is a pipe dream in part two on assa 2020 i ll cover the big mainstream issues of why the major economies are stuck in a low growth low interest rate state and what to do about it if another recession should rear its head and in part three i ll cover the issues discussed by more radical economists january 6 2020
trade tensions president donald trump left with chinese president xi jinping file photograph by susan walsh ap investors had a lot to like about 2019 across the globe equities bonds commodities high yield fixed income and precious metals markets all responded positively to the siren call of lower interest rates and increasingly accommodative global central bank monetary policies despite strong returns from most asset classes risk markets remained volatile over the course of the year as escalating geopolitical tensions and trade disputes on both sides of the atlantic periodically sent securities prices in both directions the closely watched us china trade war took centre stage but other cross border conflicts including the ongoing brexit negotiations the us mexico canada agreement and wrangling over european auto tariffs impacted both economic growth and asset prices in spite of the heightened trade and political volatility developed markets registered strong gains in 2019 the msci world equity index advanced by 25 2 per cent on a price basis making last year s return the best since 2009 emerging markets led by china lagged the broader averages but began to catch up late in the year in terms of the us china trade conflict markets applauded a phase one trade deal ostensibly struck in december the most important development on this front was no new tariffs and a reduction of some existing ones that was good enough to take some pressure off the global economy and markets caught a bid into year end helping the santa claus rally to arrive on time the phase one deal averted new levies on 156 billion of chinese imports which were threatened to be invoked on december 15 and halved the september tariffs on 120 billion of chinese goods from 15 per cent to 7 5 per cent however the 25 per cent tariff on 250 billion of chinese imports remains with the possibility of a snap back in tariffs if china doesn t follow through on its commitments white house officials said china agreed to increase its total us farm product purchases to 40 billion a year with a us goal to raise it to 50 billion annually the latest agreement is hoped to have marked peak tariffs for now as this deal represents the first time that trade talks have led to an actual reduction in tariffs rather than just a delay time will tell if sentiment has now been encouraged enough to reduce risks to global manufacturing and consumer sentiment over in europe boris johnson and his conservative party s landslide victory in uk s december election ended over 3½ years of political wrangling since a majority of the british electorate voted to leave the eu in 2016 with the conservatives securing a large majority the uk parliament quickly voted in favour of johnson s brexit bill if the european parliament also gives the green light the uk will officially exit the european union on january 31 2020 starting then the uk will enter a transition period until december 31 2020 during this time the two parties will maintain their current trade relationship while negotiating new terms the british pound soared to more than 1 35 after the election its highest level since may 2018 but has since retreated to about 1 31 looking ahead us and global business cycles are showing early signs of recovery we see the more accommodative us fed combined with similar initiatives in other countries as helping to boost global growth in 2020 in the aggregate s p 500 companies are expected to deliver high single digit earnings progress in the year ahead earnings were suppressed in 2019 by trade tensions which crimped capital spending earnings growth likely bottomed in 3q and should show stabilisation in 4q followed by stronger growth into next year tariffs likely reduced 2019 earnings growth by about 8 per cent through direct and second order trade costs an improving outlook as suggested by a bottoming in the global purchasing manager s index and monetary easing across most countries portends an uptick in output in the third quarter of 2019 16 central banks cut rates followed by a total of 23 rate cuts in q4 in terms of equity market valuations the lower interest rate environment justifies higher stock price earnings multiples we can make a case for a forward earnings multiple of 18 times on both the s p 500 and the msci world stock index the msci emerging stock index looks especially cheap at just 14 times projected forward earnings also worth noting is that in the one year run up to a presidential election the stock market has historically had positive returns about 90 per cent of the time with an average performance of about 12 per cent final resolutions on trade are a key variable for the performance of multinational corporations in the months ahead likely recent standoffs have likely been priced into the market already however should president trump come through with a phase two deal further gains are possible meanwhile cashflow in the largest corporations remains at record levels and share buybacks should continue to boost bottom line earnings per share performance expected heightened merger and acquisition activity as well while gains may continue into 2020 volatility will also likely be more pronounced last year s surge in stock prices came off the back of an outsize sell off in december of 2018 and most developed world share prices are now trading much closer to their fair values against this backdrop we continue to emphasis selectivity in building portfolios while much has been made of the value versus growth stock debate the real winner over the past decade has been quality as a factor higher quality companies or those possessing the strongest balance sheets solid economic moats and stable cash flows have exceeded the performance of lower quality companies as well as the broader indices which represent both the value and growth factors we see no reason this should not continue into the year ahead in fixed income we may have seen the beginning of the end of the latest round of fed rate cuts last summer s triple cut in the federal funds rate will likely be enough to act as an economic insurance policy for the near to intermediate term expect the short end of the us interest rate curve to stay range bound at the new lower levels however longer term rates may trend back up over 2 per cent by next summer assuming we see progress on trade talks and if the global economic recovery continues we wish you and yours and happy healthy and prosperous new year bryan dooley cfa is the senior portfolio manager and
