yves here bill black does a systematic and well deserved vivisection of the world according to thomas friedman using his latest column as a point of departure one of black s remarkable finds is that friedman acknowledged that deregulation and globalization would make financial crises endemic yet couldn t be bothered to consider that they would impose massive economic and political costs by bill black the author of the best way to rob a bank is to own one an associate professor of economics and law at the university of missouri kansas city and co founder of bank whistleblowers united jointly published with new economic perspectives part 7 of the mmt series tom friedman s april 2 2019 column concluded the united kingdom has gone mad to which the only possible response is you just noticed the uk went mad 22 years ago when parliament elected the odious tony blair prime minister i think many tory policies were mad long before that date but the labour party opposed them the entire uk did not go mad until blair created new labour and adopted tory policies and became pm in 1997 blair explicitly modeled the name and the adoption of neoliberal economic and military policies on bill clinton and the new democrats the uk became mad when both of its major parties adopted the neoliberal economic and military policies that friedman celebrates and proselytizes friedman s april 2 2019 column was about brexit which understandably sticks in the craw of the populist spreader of the myth that the world is becoming flat and a hyper meritocracy the wealthy rig the world to make it tilt sharply plutocrats tilt it to ensure that a huge and increasing share of the world s wealth flows to them friedman is the most infamous shill for those plutocrats the plutocrats tilt and warp the economy unevenly to favor not simply the wealthy but a favored subset that is typically the opposite of a meritocracy kakistocracy worse the world tilts toward catastrophe because the ultra wealthy kakistocracy s political pawns have produced environments so criminogenic that they produce our recurrent intensifying financial crises friedman is shocked that one of the two epicenters of the global kakistocracy and plutocracy the city of london has forced the uk to follow policies so self destructive and rapacious that vast swaths of the uk rose in opposition by voting for brexit the city of london of course hates brexit friedman s column does not consider the data on the primary reason a majority of uk citizens voted in favor of brexit a policy he considers mad austerity was the decisive factor that changed the expected vote on brexit from remain to leave the linked article discusses what drove support for ukip that uk party s single issue was pushing brexit polling data confirms that these predominantly working class voters devastated by austerity were the key to the public s vote in favor of brexit welfare cuts and other austerity measures implemented under the conservatives pushed vital swing voters to back brexit and won the eu referendum for the leave campaign according to a new report research published by the social market foundation suggests the best indicator of a person s referendum vote was not age or education but happiness or sadness about their personal finances with unhappy people tending to vote leave and contented ones preferring remain the report which analysed the level of cuts in each area of the uk alongside each area s growth in support for ukip argues that had it not been for austerity the referendum would not have turned out the way it did it found that in districts that received the average austerity shock ukip vote shares were on average 11 62 percentage points higher in the most recent local elections prior to the referendum than in districts with little exposure to austerity as well as area level analysis the report looked at individual level data and found that some people directly affected by welfare cuts shifted their political support to ukip and rejected the political establishment households exposed to the bedroom tax increasingly shifted to support ukip and experienced economic grievances as they fell behind with their rent payments due to the cuts the paper stated as much as 9 percentage points of the 52 per cent support for leave around 3 million votes was decided by concern about austerity and related issues the researchers estimated it suggests that without the effect of the austerity shock on welfare and public services the leave share of the referendum vote could have been as low as 43 per cent delivering a comfortable win for remain austerity means that modern monetary theory mmt is relevant to the story mmt scholars protested against uk austerity and warned it would harm the recovery it did austerity always inflicts its harm unevenly it is an enormous economic advantage to the wealthy and a horrific burden on the working class and the poor in the uk context that meant that austerity made the city of london elites that did so much to cause and profit from the orgy of control fraud and predation that caused the great financial crisis gfc even wealthier while devastating huge parts of the uk inhabited by working class families control fraud and predation is a criminology term that describes what happens when those who control a seemingly legitimate firm use it as a weapon to defraud or predate on others friedman blair and clinton s four defining acts of madness why did friedman ignore austerity the uk went mad when tony blair championed four neoliberal policies that caused massive harm the three d s deregulation desupervision and de factodecriminalization the race to the bottom between the city of london and wall street to attract the biggest most fraudulent bankers the u s invasion of iraq in 2003 austerity in response to the great financial crisis gfc friedman infamously was among the most prominent cheerleaders for these mad policies friedman loves globalization and the most far reaching dominating and harmful form of it is global finance friedman has a mad view about financial crises and globalization in the lexus and the olive tree understanding globalization 1990 462 he admitted that deregulation and globalization would cause immense harm he was writing in the heart of the savings and loan debacle global financial crises will be the norm in this coming era he added to emphasize that point crises will be endemic emphasis added friedman was correct to admit that the policies he cheered would produce endemic financial crises what he did not discuss was the endemic financial crises costs he did not discuss how we should prevent the crises or respond to them when they occurred professor alexander field of santa clara university published a study in 2017 that estimated the u s cumulative output losses over the course of the gfc and its recovery as 41 7 trillion table i p 95 a trillion is a thousand billion the figure for the eu should be substantially larger because its infliction of austerity slowed its recovery the u s figure however would have been smaller had president obama not made his infamous pivot towards austerity and the grand bargain that he sought to negotiate with republicans to weaken the safety net it was really the grand betrayal of his campaign promises and the american people friedman does not want to discuss his praise of the three de s and the race to the bottom between the city of london and wall street that created the intense criminogenic environment in both financial centers and drove the control fraud and predation epidemics that drove the gfc friedman does not want to discuss his praise of eu austerity and obama s effort to negotiate the grand betrayal blair clinton and gore obama and friedman went mad long before obama sought to negotiate the grand betrayal consider friedman s admission that the trends he champions are certain to cause endemic global financial crises that is a mad trend we desperately need to reverse it the s l regulators contained the debacle before it caused any economic crisis but it cost 150 billion to resolve we did so by reversing the deregulatory trend the enron era frauds at peak caused a 7 trillion dollar loss of market capitalization and helped spark a moderate recession the gfc caused a 41 7 trillion loss in u s output a larger loss in eu output a global financial crisis and the great recession if the trend continues the endemic global financial crises will cause catastrophic harm what is friedman s policy answer to such a devastating trend friedman gives this sage advice in his column decrying the uk going mad what do the most effective leaders today have in common they wake up every morning and ask themselves the same questions what world am i living in what are the biggest trends in this world and how do i educate my citizens about this world and align my policies so more of my people can get the best out of these trends and cushion the worst what friedman describes and praises is mad it is mad to treat a trend as inevitable trends are the product of institutional factors that create incentives institutional structures the three de s plus a race to the bottom creates the perverse incentives that create an environment so criminogenic that it will produce control fraud and control predation epidemics so harmful that they will make global financial crises endemic the most effective leaders would never accept trends that were so harmful they would work on an emergency basis to end the trends producing endemic global financial crises similarly the trends on climate change are catastrophic it is mad to accept those trends we must urgently reverse those trends friedman pretends to be vigorous on climate but his own words demonstrate that he thinks the goal should be to cushion the worst harms he wants to allow a suicidal trend to continue that is mad effective leaders do not ask what world am i living in they ask what world should we make we make our world through the democratic process when we create our institutions and our rule of law when we create a criminogenic or predatory environment we ensure that fraud and predation will become epidemic and crises endemic it is mad to do so yet that is what we have been doing for nearly 40 years it is mad to continue a mad policy when we see it produce endemic and growing financial crises that cause catastrophic harm friedman is the world s most willing apologist for the plutocrats that create these perverse environments he celebrates their alleged brilliance and claims they are spurring huge gains in productivity data destroys his apologies productivity in the eu and the u s has fallen sharply during the period we have been making finance ever more criminogenic that of course is what economists and criminologists would predict thinking that by eroding the rule of law to the point that we have made global financial crises endemic is a good way to spur economic growth is mad austerity and public bailouts of fraudulent financial firms is however a spectacularly effective policy to aid plutocrats and kleptocrats friedman s heroes and their mad neoliberal policies made the world so criminogenic that global financial crises became endemic friedman s heroes and their mad decision to invade iraq was one part farce and twelve parts tragedy president bush of course leads the list of those who were mad when it came to iraq again the tragedy is that the leaders of both major parties in the u s and the uk shared this madness friedman was their most notorious cheerleader and apologist for their muscular military policies that invading iraq epitomized his mad policies 16 years later continue to cause immense suffering and disrupt the middle east friedman has a bro crush on blair so his trademark obsequiousness to powerful males reached nauseating levels in his writings about blair two years ago friedman wrote a column praising blair as the exemplar of the ideal leader but admitting that blair was enormously unpopular among uk citizens the uk public despises blair for championing the four acts of madness that produced the gfc a mad response austerity plus bailouts of the city s fraudulent and predatory bankers to the gfc that made it far more damaging particularly to the working class and the catastrophic invasion of iraq the uk citizenry also detests blair for his greed since leaving office in becoming wealthy by shilling for the world s worst dictators and for his hypocrisy in presenting that odious behavior as charitable yes he continued to copy bill clinton s tactics after leaving office blair got as wrong as it is possible to get wrong the six great issues he faced blair optimized the criminogenic policies that produced the epidemics of control fraud and predation that drove the gfc he responded to that catastrophe by bailing out the biggest and worst bankers and banks he failed to hold accountable those elite crooks and predators for their actions or even claw back their gains from fraud and predation he and his successor he chose created the self inflicted wound of austerity that further enriched the elites and impoverished the working class he championed and was the leading defender of the invasion of iraq he disgraced his nation after leaving office friedman s juvenile enthusiasm for muscular diplomacy invading other nations friedman ignores the reasons his nation despises blair except for blair s push to invade iraq and defending it even when the facts proved that the pretexts for invasion were falsehoods and the horrific harm of the invasion became evident friedman following our family rule that is impossible to compete with unintentional self parody presented blair in and april 22 2005 column as a martyr torched by an ignorant public for his courageous and principled championing of invading iraq by that date friedman knew that the pretexts for the invasion of iraq were falsehoods that the war had caused catastrophic harm and that invading iraq had harmed the allied efforts in afghanistan the invasion had failed to produce a movement to real democracy in the mideast a fantasy that friedman promoted it was a strategic gift to iran which friedman hates in deciding to throw in britain s lot with president bush on the iraq war mr blair not only defied the overwhelming antiwar sentiment of his own party but public opinion in britain generally blair risked complete self immolation on a principle noted will marshall president of the progressive policy institute a pro democratic u s think tank neither marshall nor friedman presented an honest principle one advances by invading another nation on the basis of fake facts and turning the nation you invade into a vast charnel house the u s and the uk lost lives and treasure and the invasion was a geopolitical blunder of epic proportions for the u s and uk friedman s claimed principle was actually despicable propaganda mr blair took a principled position to depose saddam and keep britain tightly aligned with america he did so among other reasons because he believed that the advance of freedom and the defeat of fascism whether islamo fascism or nazi fascism were quintessential and indispensable liberal foreign policy goals saddam hussein was many bad things but he neither a fascist nor driven by islamic views he was notoriously secular there is no such thing as islamo fascism that was a phrase invented by bigots to attack islam there are scores of anti democratic world leaders deciding to invade and liberate nations only when their populations were overwhelmingly islamic is the opposite of principle it is prejudice powered by propaganda friedman s april 22 2015 column had to abandon the lies that formed the pretext for the invasion of iraq there were no weapons of mass destruction wmd and iraqis government had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks on the u s friedman was happy to supply new lies islamo fascism by 2015 friedman was at his most despicable and juvenile in sum tony blair has redefined british liberalism he has made liberalism about embracing managing and cushioning globalization about embracing and expanding freedom through muscular diplomacy where possible and force where necessary and about embracing fiscal discipline seriously real men gender intentional embrace muscular diplomacy we expand freedom by invading iraq in 2005 when he knew that the pretexts for the invasion were lies and the invasion had produced a catastrophe friedman enthused like a 16 year old boy about the masculine joys of muscular diplomacy invasion and chastised democrats for not being sufficiently enthusiastic about invading iraq heir own ambivalence toward muscular diplomacy cost democrats just enough votes in the american center to allow a mistake prone bush team to squeak by in 2004 the friedman doctrine is that democrats should have beaten the mistake prone bush by enthusiastically embracing bush s worst mistake invading iraq how did that sentence not sound mad to friedman when he wrote it friedman is the exemplar of our family rule that it is impossible to compete with unintentional self parody he reached his lowest level literally blasphemous in a march 16 2013 column claiming that blair invaded iraq in an act of selfless religious devotion to cure the ills of the world what does tony blair get that george bush doesn t the only way i can explain it is by a concept from the kabbalah called tikkun olam it means to repair the world if you listened to tony blair s speeches in recent weeks they contain something so strikingly absent from mr bush s tony blair constantly puts the struggle for a better iraq within a broader context of moral concerns tony blair always leaves you with the impression that for him the iraq war is just one hammer and one nail in an effort to do tikkun olam to repair the world i leave the disproof of this blasphemy to the reader thefaux progressive faux think tank and faux growth the obvious question is what the progressive policy institute is that shared friedman s masculine joy about invading iraq a quintessentially anti progressive and mad policy it is the new democrats and new labour s anti progressive shop at all times blair copied clinton a 2015 guardian article demonstrated ppi s message discipline and its blindness to reality the ppi talisman was growth at columbia university in new york this weekend the progressive policy institute which helped bill clinton and tony blair pioneer so called third way politics in the 1990s held a closed door strategy session for congressional staffers that was designed to find ways of promoting growth there is no question that the prevailing temper of the democratic party is populist strongly sceptical of what we like to call capitalism and angry about the perceived power of the monied elite in politics said ppi president and founder will marshall but inequality is not the biggest problem we face it is symptomatic of the biggest problem we face which is slow growth al from a leading figure of the centre left who chaired the democratic leadership council during the first clinton presidency argues that a focus on inequality though understandable after the banking crash risks driving all candidates too far from policies that would promote growth culturally the country has progressed a lot and we are not going back says from who points especially to changing attitudes to gay marriage and women s rights but the question is whether a major political party can sustain itself solely on cultural issues and can have a real shot at governing if it doesn t have a growth agenda as part of its programme representative kind the head of the house caucus of new democrats and a strong hillary supporter was willing to give a quotation explaining that hillary was lying about her opposition to obama s trans pacific partnership tpp in order to deceive democratic primary voters i d lie if i said i wasn t disappointed with the statement that she made on tpp says representative kind everyone knew where she was on that and where she will be but given the necessities of the moment and a tough democratic primary she felt she needed to go there initially al from the long time leader of the new democrats was willing to quoted presenting an even more cynical illustration of new democrat realpolitik and another ode to growth paradoxically some new democrats may even relish a sanders resurgence pointing to the similar experience of ed miliband and jeremy corbyn in the british labour party which they claim will ultimately prove the folly of pandering to the left if we are going to be a governing party we have to but there is not going to be any pressure in the presidential process until we lose an election or two concludes from the new democrats problems include nominating their candidate hillary and losing to donald trump the bigger problem is that they think that we should tolerate extraordinary income inequality to promote growth what has happened to u s growth rates as inequality surged growth has fallen sharply epidemics of control fraud and predation cause real growth to become negative bubbles hide this reality by creating data that are nonsense but once the bubble collapses the real economic situation emerges the collapse eviscerates growth but the expansion of the bubble means allocates credit inefficiently which harms growth austerity gratuitously increases the lost growth the key to preventing this lost growth is an effective rule of law preventing the epidemics of control fraud and predation the new democrats and blair are terrible on each of these essential prerequisites of real economic growth bill clinton was exceptionally lucky in the timing of his presidency his supposed economic success was the product of the immense dot com bubble and the even larger housing bubble the housing bubble expanded throughout his eight years in office president bush continued clinton and gore s assault on the rule of law by making even deeper cuts in federal banking regulators and preempting state attorney generals efforts to stop the three epidemics of control fraud plus predation that drove the gfc clinton and bush made the same promise deregulation would spur a sharp increase in growth it did the opposite an effective rule of law and regulation is an essential aspect of that rule of law is essential to produce real growth when you strip away the bubbles you strip away the clinton and bush growth and see the reality blair brexit and friedman show the need for mmt insights part one the mmt critique of orthodox microfoundations orthodox modern macro is based on microfoundations that implicitly assume that firms profit maximize that there are no negative externalities that there is no market power and that there is no control fraud or predation in sum they assume out of existence reality and particularly the parts of reality that produce the endemic global financial crises that friedman admits his favored model produce friedman of course loved both blair and brown in the same april 22 2005 column friedman described brown as blair s deft finance minister perhaps he meant to write daft in 2005 the uk was racing toward the gfc it nosed wall street at the wire to win the regulatory race to the bottom that produced the epidemics of control fraud and predation in the u s and the uk that hyper inflated bubbles and drove the gfc the uk economy was sick in 2005 it was systematically misallocating capital it was driven not by real industrial productivity gains but by accounting scams in the city of london the ethics of the city of london had fallen to sewer levels its biggest banks had been specializing in predating on their customers for two decades its most prestigious bankers were driving the two largest price rigging cartels libor and forex in world history even the sleaziest u s bankers at the vampire squid goldman sachs based their worst most rapacious predators in the city of london on any real economic basis many of the uk s largest banks were insolvent because of their terrible asset quality the uk was only two years before the first large bank crisis of the gfc the run on northern rock only a government bailout saved the bank from immediate failure friedman the triple pulitzer prize winner supposedly the world s expert on globalization was oblivious to reality he believed the financial ceos who wine and dine him and receive his unctuous praise friedman s 2005 column called the uk economy strong and vibrant he attributed this to blair and brown embracing friedman s mantra we all need to to firmly embrace the free market and globalization the brits think we are incapable of irony and perhaps they are right about friedman to state the obvious the city of london s leaders despises free markets they love control fraud and predation and price rigging cartels their business model is control fraud and predation plus price rigging cartels they love tax evasion money laundering and sanction busting those are sanctions against terrorism which friedman purports to love they run criminal enterprises they assist other criminal enterprises and wealthy criminals evade the tax laws these financial control fraud and predation drove the fiction of the vibrant uk economy which was actually a predatory and wealth destroying economy when the city of london reports enormous profits we know that they are making the world poorer and sleazier the city of london s leaders like wall street s leaders are the most powerful generators of the gresham s dynamic george akerlof explained and named the dynamic in his famous 1970 article on markets for lemons ishonest dealings tend to drive honest dealings out of the market the cost of dishonesty therefore lies not only in the amount by which the purchaser is cheated the cost also must include the loss incurred from driving legitimate business out of existence control fraud and predation mean that markets are neither free nor efficient control fraud and predation cause market forces to become perverse when cheaters prosper markets harm consumers and honest business people finance is particularly important in this regard for it disciplines ceos to maximize reported returns control fraud and predation are the easiest and surest ways to maximize reported returns this means that finance tends to send enormous amounts of capital to the worst actors and deny it to the best intensifying the gresham s dynamic in the real economy financial executives also rake off enormous profits for themselves further reducing efficiency and growth globalization means that the harmful effects of the gresham s dynamic can now dominate industries globally again finance is the whip hand of globalization s most perverse incentives there is no such thing as natural free markets a vibrant rule of law that effectively constrains control fraud and predation is essential to well functioning markets the race to the bottom of regulation that the city of london barely won over wall street eviscerated effective financial regulation in the two financial epicenters of globalization this supercharged the gresham s dynamic which produces endemic control fraud and predation blair and brown were the two uk leaders most culpable for destroying any effective rule of law in finance effective financial regulation is essential to creating an effective rule of law and an effective rule of law is essential to block the gresham s dynamic when we regulate finance effectively we make possible not harm free markets markets without effective financial regulation are neither free nor efficient blair and brown did not hide from friedman their zest for destroying regulation particularly financial regulation and winning the race to the bottom against wall street i have written two articles about this point blair delivered his most famous speech attacking regulation only one month after friedman s april 22 2005 column praising blair blair most famously made public his war on regulation and his embrace of winning the regulatory race to the bottom in his may 26 2005 speech on risk and the state blair explicitly cited regulatory restraints on financial control fraud that the u s adopted after the enron era control fraud epidemic as the exemplar of the rules he was most dedicated to never adopting blair admitted that because of his light touch regulatory policies the uk is very lightly regulated by international standards that was not sufficient for blair to win the race to the bottom against wall street blair was dedicated to making the uk the weakest major financial regulator blair bragged in his speech that he had ordered light touch regulation be the standard the new inspectorates will be actively charged with ensuring those doing well get a light touch approach at a time when uk financial regulation in reality was effectively non existent and uk financial control fraud and predation were epidemic blair claimed with all his faux sincerity that the city of london fraudsters and predators were the honest victims of rapacious regulators but something is seriously awry when the financial services authority that was established to provide clear guidelines and rules for the financial services sector and to protect the consumer against the fraudulent is seen as hugely inhibiting of efficient business by perfectly respectable companies that have never defrauded anyone the uk satirical magazine private eye aptly labeled the fsa the fundamentally supine authority there was no major uk bank whose officers had never defrauded anyone the fsa did not even slightly inconvenience much less hugely inhibit any uk bank the uk parliamentary inquiry commission reported on a related and analogous disaster caused by light touch approaches the corporate governance of large banks was characterised by the creation of potemkin villages to give the appearance of effective control and oversight without the reality friedman the master of unintentional self parody celebrated how blair had increased spending on law and order yes at the same time that blair and brown eviscerated law and order for elite white collar criminals they increased spending on law and order for blue collar criminals friedman cheered that combination friedman as late as 2017 was writing that the u s had a critical need to enact sensible deregulation he had seen u s deregulation produce the fraud epidemics that drove the savings and loan debacle the enron era frauds and the gfc uk deregulation produce the epidemics of control fraud and predation that caused the gfc icelandic deregulation produce the fraud epidemics that drove its financial crisis and irish deregulation produce the fraud epidemics that drove its financial catastrophe this is another example of friedman s central madness the belief that heads of state should allow horrific trends to continue and merely ameliorate the worst aspects of those trends friedman however wants to exacerbate the disastrous trend by increasing deregulation even though existing regulation is woefully weak part 2 the mmt macroeconomic critique of blair brown obama and friedman the gfc and austerity devastated uk and u s growth austerity drove the leave vote in favor of brexit friedman and his heroes blair the clintons and obama betrayed the working class that was once the core of the labour party and the democratic party by adopting austerity in response to the gfc obama who told the congressional new democrats caucus that he was a new democrat initially supported stimulus but he quickly abandoned it that stimulus program was too small but relative to the eu and the uk it still set the u s on a path of a far quicker recovery from the gfc by early 2010 obama was working with republicans to slash the safety net and increase the severity of austerity the grand betrayal that he called the grand bargain fortunately tea party republicans were pretending to worry about deficits and they killed the grand betrayal because it did not do enough to rend the safety net these policies were all mad due to blair and gordon brown his chosen successor the labour party was an enthusiastic promoter of severe austerity even before the gfc began friedman of course proclaimed this a stellar virtue has made liberalism about embracing fiscal discipline by liberalism friedman means the american usage the three critical questions are what does he mean by fiscal discipline why does he think it is great and why does he think american liberals should embrace it friedman does not even try to answer any of these questions to him it is self evident that fiscal discipline is a virtue next to godliness mmt however demonstrates that the budgetary balanceof nations with sovereign currencies are not matters of ethics the contentsof the budget have great moral content spending massive amounts of money to invade iraq is a grotesquely immoral budgetary policy failing to spend money to fix acute societal problems is inefficient and immoral failing to provide adequate stimulus in response to a gfc is self destructive and immoral adopting austerity in response to a gfc is beyond stupid self destructive and immoral friedman was particularly impressed that blair s surpluses helped the government pay down its national debt orthodox economists tend to believe that running a surplus during an economic upturn is obviously desirable mmt teaches that this is frequently not the case budget surpluses are leading predictors of serious u s recessions and depressions there is nothing inherently virtuous about running a budget surplus even during a period of robust economic growth a budget surplus may be a desirable as a means of reducing inflationary pressures when there is a shortage of real resources i m afraid there is no money mmt explains why nations like the u s and uk with sovereign currencies cannot run out of their own money such nations are not remotely equivalent to households when it comes to budgets and deficits blair brown obama and friedman illustrate the ignorance of money and the terrible harm that ignorance can cause there is dumb and then there is brown s appointee liam byrne chief secretary to the treasury under gordon brown left a note for his successor that proved to be a gift for the conservatives the note said i m afraid there is no money the tories of course made copies of the note and waved them at campaign rallies the uk has a sovereign currency it had an unlimited amount of its own money real resources not a sovereign currency can suffer real shortages and those shortages can be important e g by driving harmful levels of inflation in a great recession it is vital that a government with a sovereign currency adopt fiscal stimulus real resources are rarely so scarce in a great recession that there is any risk of fiscal stimulus causing harmful inflation stimulus is a win win win win in those circumstances it reduces unemployment increases growth reduces the ultimate deficit and reduces the risk of a deflation trap new democrats new labour and friedman however all favor austerity and think national budget deficits are immoral here are key excerpts from byrne s efforts to explain why he wrote the note as one would expect from someone that would write such a note his explanation is incoherent delusional and intended to excuse his failures the final years of gordon brown s government were tough his leadership of britain and the g20 at the london summit stopped the collapse of lehman brothers triggering a global depression an incredible achievement we should never have stopped shouting about but the recession slashed treasury tax receipts by over 40bn forcing us to borrow to keep public services on the go and get britain back on its feet and because the deficit was big the responsible thing to do was draw up a long term plan to cut spending in government it was my job to craft a plan as chief secretary i spent bruising months negotiating 32bn of annual savings to help halve the deficit in just four years and set out in huge detail in our 2010 budget of course the conservatives attacked us though it was the timetable they eventually delivered those negotiations were tough and bruising and so in my final hours of office i was writing thank you notes to my incredible team of civil servants and then i thought i d write one letter more to my successor into my head came the phrase i d used to negotiate all those massive savings with my colleagues i m afraid there is no money nearly every phrase of his excuse is false brown did not prevent a global depression he was an important cause of the gfc lehman s failure did not cause the uk crisis uk bankers and anti regulators caused it a government with a sovereign currency does not have to borrow it routinely creates money through computer keystrokes no it does not follow that because a deficit is large the responsible thing is to plan to reduce spending the responsible thing is to increase spending which can greatly speed the recovery and support future productive spending it is insane in response to a great recession to cut spending to halve the deficit in just four years byrne is describing a plan for brutal self destructive austerity labour s austerity was sure to turn much of the uk into an economic anti opportunity zone sowing the seeds of brexit the fact that byrne used the same economically illiterate phrase repeatedly with the uk labour cabinet without a single minister telling him he was illiterate tells us how pervasive the rot was among new labour s leadership i have written previously on this same rot infesting new democrats in fairness byrne s note was strikingly similar to one of the all time stupid statements of another official president obama in a c span interview that caused conservatives to chortle obama channeled his inner byrne scully you know the numbers 1 7 trillion debt a national deficit of 11 trillion at what point do we run out of money obama well we are out of money now we are operating in deep deficits mmt is not simply an ivory tower theory finance professionals use it because it produces superior predictive results if politicians like blair brown and obama had studied mmt they would have avoided many of their worst economic blunders that brought us brexit and trump

when china wakes up she will shake the world this famous prediction of napoleon has been confirmed by history particularly in the last 20 years china has become an economic power of primary importance that objectively threatens the world leadership of the united states but now for the first time beijing will no longer be a buffer against world recession as it was after the 1990s and until very recently but one of its triggers now the question is not just how will china enter the impending world recession but above all how will it come out of it trade donald trump s trade war with china is no joke in december it caused a 63 percent fall in us imports from china and at the same time there was a collapse of foreign direct investment towards beijing in november it was 26 3 percent according to data from the ministry of commerce and this continued in the following months although at less devastating levels the value of stocks on the shanghai stock exchange has also fallen by 20 percent in the same period however the most interesting data as observed by il sole 24 ore is that a dramatic fall in private investments and a substantial recovery in the investments of state companies were already underway in conflict with what had previously been decided donald trump s trade war caused a 63 percent fall in us imports from china in december 2018 and a collapse of foreign direct investment towards beijing image socialist appeal in other words they had to plug the crisis through state spending and avoid the risk of contagion given that as the world bank writes china is deeply integrated into the global economy suffice it to say that china s investments represent one fifth of global investments and account for 42 percent of the recovery after the crisis in 2010 15 the decline in chinese private investment raises serious concerns on the part of the government over the country s gdp growth prospects china s potential growth is expected to decrease from its previous 10 6 percent in 2010 to 6 percent in 2020 today it is officially at 6 4 percent this may seem positive by european standards but with a 4 percent population growth and internal mobility of tens of millions of chinese who move from the countryside to the cities every year looking for a job this figure is considered to indicate a stagnant economy and moreover is destined to worsen a sea of debt furthermore the chinese economy is beginning to drown in a sea of debt as was the case in all the historically advanced countries of world capitalism in recent years with the difference that beijing has accumulated its debt over a much shorter period of time according to the international monetary fund imf chinese state debt has reached us 6 trillion while the total overall debt which also includes household private and bank debts stands at the astronomical level of us 23 trillion as we will see despite the efforts undertaken by xi jinping to reach an agreement with the us on trade it is unlikely that these will have a lasting positive impact the pressure is bound to increase in the face of numerous declarations that go in the direction of détente between the two countries the facts tell a different story huawei china s largest telecommunications company is preparing a billion dollar lawsuit against the us government certainly the us request for the canadian authorities to put meng wanzhou the financial director as well as the founder s daughter of the chinese giant under house arrest cannot be considered an act of reconciliation towards beijing pressure from the us and the european commission against the italian government is becoming more and more aggressive italy has been accused of acting as a trojan horse favouring the penetration of chinese products into the european market by joining the one belt one road also known as the new silk road initiative during chinese president xi jinping s recent visit to italy on 22 march italy officially signed up to the chinese mega project what we see here is china s new role and the level of the conflict that is maturing on an international scale overproduction china has a desperate need to widen its commercial outlets as it has been overproducing for some time even though the xi jinping government has gone beyond the natural laws of capitalism and has continued to invest impressive amounts as a measure to artificially support the economy this policy of credit expansion which economists call quantitative easing which all the central banks in the world overdid after the 2008 crisis is being used less and less for the simple reason that it no longer has an effect as bloomberg confirmed recently 01 17 2019 the fed the american central bank abandoned it more than a year ago followed by the ecb in january of this year in japan it has had no effect for at least a decade now it is china s turn to find itself in a paradoxical situation as only a part of the gigantic debt that it has accumulated has served to develop new industrial technologies and infrastructures while a substantial part has gone to support the national currency and defunct public enterprises that can no longer survive on their own within the market this is for the simple reason that if the chinese government had acted any differently it would have added to unemployment created by private companies carrying out tens of millions of redundancies in the state owned companies china needs to widen its commercial outlets as it has been overproducing for some time even though xi jinping has gone beyond the natural laws of capitalism to invest and artificially support the economy image kremlin ru so we see how keynesian policies are no longer having the desired effect even in china in the only country that seemed to still have the financial resources to maintain them beijing continues to have significant foreign exchange reserves 3 2 trillion dollars even if this is down compared to 4 4 trillion a few years ago and certainly has the largest banks in the world although new clouds are gathering on the horizon in addition to the debt bubble the real estate bubble and the protectionist measures of trump china is starting to have problems even with its allies that joined one belt one road in recent years several of these countries have fallen into the classic debt trap and are indebted at levels that are no longer sustainable including among others malaysia pakistan myanmar sri lanka etc malaysia recently cancelled 22billion of investments financed by china sri lanka has asked the imf for help pakistan is preparing to do the same even though mike pompeo us secretary of state has already declared that they will not give pakistan a penny if this money goes to repay debts to china the pressures made by china to bring india into the project resulted first in the conflict in bhutan and more recently in the resumption of the conflict on the kashmir border with the killing of two indian fighters by the pakistani army there is now an increasingly stable alliance between the usa india japan and australia to limit chinese expansion in asia and the world the exhaustion of quantitative easing policies by the us fed and the relative increase in interest rates on the dollar have caused a further shock for china as capital is tending to flee the country already in 2015 the government s attempt to support the currency cost billions on the other hand accepting the devaluation would lead to new heavy internal contradictions increases in interest rates and the cost of imports and external contradictions increased commercial tensions the rising level of tension with the us is revealed by changes in china s foreign policy which in the past had always been prudent which is confirmed in the situation in venezuela where china has openly sided with maduro they need commercial outlets through consolidating economic relations and finding new economic and political partners this will bring them up against the interests of the us and also the european union that is why beyond public declarations commercial tensions are destined to remain and even deepen working class and students towards a chinese 68 as a result of the crisis companies are starting to close in china despite the state s efforts unemployment is growing although this is not accurately recorded by the regime s statistics and trade union disputes are on the increase the thing that worries the regime the most is that these disputes which have been growing since 2008 are also starting to involve students in guangdong the manufacturing centre of china and the world about 50 students joined the workers of jasic international at the end of july and wanted to unionise legally under the acftu the jasic workers initially obtained permission from the acftu to unionise but the latter then rescinded their permission which prompted the workers to enter into struggle see our article china jasic workers struggle reveals rising class tensions the workers as soon as the students and workers gathered in a hotel in huizhou they were arrested by police in riot gear in major chinese universities students have stopped attending the official courses on marxism presented as courses on the theory of economic development since the autumn while self run courses have been organised on the crisis of overproduction and the class struggle the rector of beijing university has threatened to close the student run marxist society charging its members with developing a doctrine that aims to build links with the working class instead of sticking to the orthodoxy of the chinese communist party in nanjing two students were arrested in a demonstration against the non recognition of the marxist society and between november and december 12 students mysteriously disappeared in beijing shanghai guanzhou shenzen and wuhan students are beginning to link up with the working class and are facing state repression image jasic worker solidarity the government has hired thugs who threatened and beat up the students who organised the search for their missing comrades the university administrators have accused them of conducting criminal activities the main reason why these students scare the regime so much is due to the fact that they come from elite universities they are the children of the new chinese ruling class and senior officials of the ccp bureaucracy these young people are gifted and influential they were taught to consider themselves as neoliberals thinking only of their own careers they were supposed to compete with each other and only think about how to make money and make their way through life then at some point they realised that despite their efforts and sacrifices they could not get the jobs they aspired to and they have ended up rediscovering marx what we are witnessing in china is a phenomenon very similar to what was seen in the french may 68 and in the italian hot autumn where the children of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie turned to the factories in search of unity with the working class the difference compared to back then is not only the size of the phenomenon china has a population of 1 4 billion and the most impressive industrial working class ever seen in history but above all in the fact that the chinese working class has no points of reference on the political and trade union level they are young and much more educated than the first generation of workers that emigrated from the countryside in the early 1990s to work in the cities this second generation not only does not trust the ruling party the ccp and the official unions but tends towards organising independent unions becoming the protagonist of uncontrollable mobilisations with real outbursts of anger against the regime there is no mass communist opposition party in china today such as that of marchais or berlinguer who in the 1960s and 1970s led the mobilisations in france and italy down reasonable and reformist channels who can play that role in today s china a young man who organised one of the student marxist societies was asked what are the causes of this return to marxism among young people in china the answer was the government focuses on confucianism the extended family and nationalism but this no longer works amongst the main causes for at least 20 percent of young chinese people looking at marxism there are basically two the slowing down of the economy and the revolutionary tradition of the country so to answer the questions posed at the beginning of this article we can say that china will enter the coming recession as a country that aspires to the leadership of world capitalism but which will emerge as an epicentre of a new revolutionary process transforming napoleon s hypothesis into the most earth shattering and grandiose of realities
navel gazing in a sea of liquidity pixabay a quarter of wrong well that was something data by ycharts but more to the point just last quarter data by ycharts while not the q1 rally we saw in chinese equities the fedâ s double reversal and continued trade optimism drove us equities back to levels last seen in early october hereâ s how i framed 2019 on christmas eve 2018 by all historical measures the stock market is overvalued this doesn t mean stocks cannot go even higher like they did in 1999 but we are 10 years into this cycle and the limits of the recent massive fiscal stimulus will become apparent in q1 2019 even if revenues remain strong earnings growth rates will slow as the one year effect of the corporate tax cuts disappear and headwinds appear i expect the year to close out strong but bad news will be just around the corner the market is being driven even less than usual by fundamentals and more by sentiment i donâ t believe the upside potential is justified by the risks well that was a quarter of wrong but i can pretty much copy and paste my bullets from three months ago especially that one in bold we are floating a sea of central bank liquidity that we can just as easily drown in like japan has for going on 25 years now as i will discuss below in the positioning and performance section i underperformed the s p this quarter but it doesnâ t bother me that much because i donâ t believe the added return is worth the risk the dangers of watching the â realâ economy the us government when not shut down publishes a lot of data about the economy most of which is ignored if people pay it any mind they read a headline about the headline number and maybe a couple of bullet points on seeking alpha but with the very important data sets like the quarterly gdp report much of the interesting information is in the splits and supplementary tables so if you spend a lot of time pouring over these tables like i do and you see rapid changes in them like weâ re seeing now you can wind up far ahead of market sentiment but that doesnâ t change the fact there are numerous signs of a slowing global and domestic economy at the same time the data is backward looking even preliminary numbers which often come with large revisions are a month or two stale by the time we get them solid numbers are generally a quarter old so you can easily lose sight of current conditions the market is historically overvalued achtung none of the measurements in this section are good indicators of short term movements in the market but are rather presented as evidence of the high valuation of the s p 500 all the s p data in this section come from robert schillerâ s s p 500 data set that goes back to the 19th century which is updated daily by the good folks at multpl com also i will be discussing median values a lot remember that medians are not a support level but typically more of a look out below in a bear market by historical measures the s p 500 is overvalued while not at the peaks of january 2018 we are still seeing levels that are very high and not justified by either corporate earnings or gdp growth the time periods below are a little shifted with the s p and gdp march march while profits are for the calendar years yoy 2 yr cagr 3 yr cagr 4 yr cagr 5 yr cagr s p 500 q1 7 33 12 52 11 23 8 20 8 65 real gdp growth q1 2 94 2 99 2 49 2 25 2 56 before tax corporate profits growth q4 0 17 1 13 0 68 0 95 0 25 after tax corporate profits growth q4 6 32 5 87 3 88 1 21 1 71 click to enlarge multpl com bea atlanta fed for q1 gdp growth iâ ve used the atlanta fed gdpnow estimate of 2 1 annualized which is now well above the blue chip consensus number of 1 4 iâ ve included before tax profits to filter out the effects of the tax bill for an apple to apples comparison over time profits figures come from the last gdp report in any event you can see that absent the 1 year effects of the tax bill on year over year comps the s p performance is far outstripping the real economyâ s growth minus the tax bill we are already in an earnings recession and every day brings new downward guidance iâ ll get into the tax bill in more detail below for historical analysis pe10 the inflation adjusted 10 year rolling average pe developed by robert schiller is a much better measure of market valuation than pe that smooths out much of the noise in the straight pe number and makes more sense when laid out over us recessions pe is very volatile and not very well correlated to the beginning of recessions in fact pe looks more like a trailing indicator of recession than a leading one honestly i donâ t find it very useful first the historical chart for pe10 the pe10 peaked in january at over 33 and then again at the end of the september rally this is high by historical standards eclipsing all but the dot com bubble which is literally off the chart a return to the median historical pe10 of 15 68 in this window would drop the s p to about 1450 but as you can see the last 2 cycles look very different from the previous once with peaks only matched by 1929 and only one brief dip below the median when i look at a chart where every cycle looks pretty similar until the last two i start asking myself if thereâ s any merit to this time itâ s different so letâ s look at the data again but this time beginning in the 1990s during the â great moderationâ of low inflation and interest rates beginning at the pe10 low in october 1990 the median pe10 in this window is 25 5 which would be a drop in the s p to about 2360 one of the more obscure market valuations is the buffet indicator in a 2001 interview with fortune warren buffett said the market value of all publicly traded securities as a percentage of the country s business that is as a percentage of gnp the ratio has certain limitations in telling you what you need to know still it is probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment iâ m going to modify this a bit and use the wilshire 5000 to nominal gdp ratio while there isnâ t much back testing here it looks like a nice leading indicator of recession as you can see weâ re up in no manâ s land a return to the median of 0 92 would drop the s p to about 1875 the great moderation back in the stone ages the 1970s a series of bad policy choices by nixon ford and carter along with the oil shortages in the later half of the decade caused core cpi inflation to spike to 13 6 by 1980 interest rates rose to corresponding levels in 1979 my parents bought their first house with a 17 5 mortgage true story the first step to curing the stagflation of the 1970s and likely the most important for getting the ball rolling was paul volker pushing the fed funds rate up to 19 to break inflation this caused a massive recession and much hardship but it was entirely necessary itâ s just about the gutsiest thing a fed chair has ever done and makes the current kerfuffle over jerome powell laughable for reaganâ s part he whined a bit but mostly refrained from commenting on fed policy and took his beating in the polls with a smile as unemployment spiked eventually he re nominated volker in 1983 so kudos to both men for pure political courage the likes of which we rarely see anymore secondly anyone who has read my writing knows i am not a big fan of debt funded tax cuts but in 1981 this was the right policy the top rate was 70 which had all sorts of distortionary effects on behavior additionally the short term stimulative effect of the tax cut was needed to soften the blow of draconian fed policy iâ ll go into some detail why i find the supply side story unconvincing and i believe that the data unambiguously back me up i believe that the best tax rates weâ ve seen were in the 90s when we saw the last vestige of rational fiscal policy with deficits at the beginning of the cycle and surpluses at the end but the first two rounds of reagan tax cuts with subsequent adjustments by bush i and clinton were very important to this macro trend fred since the peaks in the 70s inflation has remained tamed at first the policies of the volker fed broke the back of inflation and brought it back to more reasonable levels in the 3 5 range but after the 90s recession inflation began dropping into its current range of 1 5 2 5 without any significant fed policy driving it since then inflation has remained historically low and the fed has not had big inflationary cues to raise the fed funds rate as investors became convinced that the new low inflation regime was not going anywhere long term rates as represented by the 10 year treasury have been dropping steadily over this long period people spend a lot of time focusing on the fed funds rate but long term rates are much more important to the health of the economy because this is the type of borrowing that actually funds investment as you can see from the chart these rates are largely out of the control of fed policy my contention is that the end of the soviet bloc and the continued expansion of free trade agreements led to an explosion of trade globally but especially here in the us total us real trade imports plus exports as a percentage of gdp has risen from 12 in the 1980s to 32 in 2018 fred why is this important it used to be an obvious point but no longer is trade reduces prices and tames inflation hereâ s a comparison of the consumer price index for the whole economy and the import price index for just imports fred while the cpi is up about 170 in this period the ipi is only up 60 imports are cheaper or else they wouldnâ t be imported look at the ipi in the 1990s it barely budged without the growth of imports inflation would have been much higher in this period this entire era of low inflation low long term interest rates and resulting high stock valuations rests on the continued expansion of trade i want to type this 100 times but if you have any takeaways from this article please let this be it my preliminary data caveat when a data set is revised it generally means the preliminary numbers come with very high error intervals and often big revisions i used to use the bls jobs numbers as the example here massive revisions are common in the series but we have a new champion for preliminary data series you should probably just ignore home sales here without apparent irony is what is on the current table from the census bureau for those of you who slept through statistics not blaming you that means the mom growth range is 9 5 to 19 3 or anything in between the northeast growth range is from 27 0 to 80 8 moreover this is a 90 confidence interval rather than the more commonly used 95 which means there is a 1 out of 10 chance that the true number lies outside this already massive error range the most recent revision turned january from an awful month at 6 9 to a standout at 8 2 mom â an upward revision of 15 percentage points of growth this is what a useless data set looks like there are many things that cause revisions and without being an economist at the census bureau bls or bea itâ s impossible to know what they are â every reporting period is different and is filled with non recurring items but itâ s always been my mostly unsupported theory that the size and direction of revisions tell you about trends at the end of the reporting period that didnâ t show up in the first report as such i always pay a lot of attention to the size and direction of revisions as well as the current number as i believe they give us a better idea about the following reporting period you have been warned slowing it is now beyond question that the global economy has been slowing since the 2018 q2 peaks this began hitting the us economy in q3 but december was a really bad month and the timing for that was terrible january and february seem to have been a little better but not in a huge way all of the â realâ data in this section uses chained prices rather than the more commonly reported cpi deflator unlike cpi chained pricing uses a changing basket of goods that reflects current spending patterns and is a far better way of deflating nominal values the quarterly data in this section comes from gdp table 1 5 6 â real gross domestic product expanded detail in billions of chained 2012 dollars seasonally adjusted at annual rates â thatâ s a sexy title also this is the final print from march so the numbers are as accurate as theyâ re going to get to set the stage the 2018 q2 report was truly a blockbuster with the annualized headline number at 4 16 the best since 2014 q3 but the good news was not just in the headline with great growth up and down the tables the highlights led by durable goods at 8 64 personal consumption was up 3 80 annualized led by non residential construction it and ip fixed investment surged 6 38 annualized even while non farm inventories shrank had inventories remained flat the headline gdp number would have been 4 83 annualized growth not 4 16 exports were up 9 27 annualized while imports shrank marginally the good news was over quickly the big story in q3 gpd was that despite the high headline number of 3 36 61 of that growth went into warehouses as companies built up inventories ahead of tariffs expecting huge payoff in q4 that did not come the headline number without changes to non farm inventories was 1 30 not 3 36 growth rates in personal consumption and fixed investment shrank considerably and export growth was actually negative in the quarter q4 saw more disappointment with a revised downward headline growth rate of 2 17 the worst part all of that went into inventories itâ s all just sitting in warehouses and car lots the news from the q4 report splits personal consumption growth is down to 1 7 annualized from 3 8 in q2 durables shrank from 8 84 annualized growth in q2 to 3 40 in q4 non durables growth also shrank considerably in q4 after holding up well in q3 ditto for household services exports and fixed investment recovered a bit residential construction was down 4 72 in 2018 while non residential construction was up 4 90 while other investment categories have been up and down investment in ip is very strong up almost 11 in 2018 federal spending was up 2 73 in 2018 but it all went to the defense budget â up 5 05 while the non defense budget was down 0 53 stepping back what i see is that the us consumer the engine of global growth is slowing down and inventories have built up as corporate buyers have overbought and manufacturers have overproduced figures in billions of 2012 chained dollars seasonally adjusted but not annualized q2 gdp q4 gdp h2 gdp growth h2 gdp growth 4 627 9 4 691 3 63 4 1 37 q3 inventory growth q4 inventory growth h2 inventory growth of h2 gdp growth in inventories 23 9 25 8 49 7 78 32 click to enlarge so on january 1 78 of 2018 h2 real gdp growth was still sitting in warehouses and car lots all of it has to be sold before adding a single dime to gdp letâ s dig deeper and see whatâ s going on here the us consumer when everything else is going wrong the whole would counts on the us consumer to save the day but at least in december and january it has not been happening letâ s start by looking at income and whatâ s happening to it employment has been very strong though u 6 unemployment red line jumped 50 bps in january fred it is probably shutdown related and the rate is now lower than decemberâ s in the preliminary february and march numbers iâ ve included the spread between u 6 and u3 green line so you can see how the problem of marginally attached and involuntary part time workers that plagued the early recovery has abated but my own favored measure of real ish time unemployment the 4 week moving average of continuing claims has been moving in the wrong direction since november though we have see a sharp reversal in the last 2 weeks the labor departmentâ s employment numbers are based on survey data which come with large error intervals in the preliminary numbers and we often donâ t have a good handle on a reporting period until it is 3 months stale on the other hand unemployment claims are very hard data as state governments are party to every single transaction revisions are very small so we get a pretty reliable number that is only about 10 days stale when the report comes out weekly as you can see beginning in the first week of november we ended the 8 year downward trend and continuing claims rose before during and after the shutdown the last 2 weeks saw a sharp reversal so we have to see where that goes so even though recent trends may be going in the wrong direction the employment situation is still very strong and this translated into strong growth in disposable income and personal consumption almost to the end of 2018 the quarterly numbers in annualized qoq growth of chained 2012 dollars per capita 17q1 17q2 17q3 17q4 18q1 18q2 18q3 18q4 disposable income 3 86 1 60 1 51 1 61 3 88 1 17 1 93 3 61 personal consumption 2 33 2 49 2 43 3 65 0 65 3 72 3 85 2 52 click to enlarge bea bea these are mostly very strong numbers and despite a january blip due to a tough comp with big december bonuses wage income growth has remained strong in january and february but for some reason personal consumption of goods collapsed in december and january just as inventories were rising to new records this was led by durables bea what this looks like to me is that everyone did their christmas shopping on black friday and then just stopped the annualized growth in the trailing 3 months including the november surge is 0 29 with goods at 4 03 and durables at 10 73 in the major categories only food and services held up so where did the money go the answer is savings which surged in december and january bea had consumers saved that income in december and january at the 2018 average rate of 6 5 it would have added another 300 billion to pce in those months retail moving up the economic ladder from consumers to retail we find that retail sales were very strong in october and november and then just fell off a cliff as consumers started saving in december letâ s see if we can tease out where the weakness is first letâ s look at the headline numbers excluding gas stations and groceries chained 2012 dollars seasonally adjusted at monthly rates december january february 1 month growth 1 56 0 75 0 23 2 month cgr 0 64 0 41 0 20 3 month cgr 0 25 0 18 0 47 12 month cgr 0 04 0 12 0 07 click to enlarge census bureau as you can see all the gains in retail trade of the first 11 months of 2018 have been mostly wiped out by inflation and a new perhaps temporary preference for savings over consumption the growth from januaryâ s revised up number was not enough to make up for the hole in demand and retail is only up 0 07 yoy the lowlights from decemberâ s splits line item percent of december ex food gas decline non store retail 44 11 general merchandise 17 59 health care 10 73 misc 10 03 sporting goods hobby music books 6 13 clothing 5 40 total 93 99 click to enlarge census bureau these 6 categories were responsible for 94 of the 1 56 mom decline in december retail since a large portion is the three general categories itâ s difficult to zero in on where exactly the weakness is the only categories not to see declines were small bumps in autos and building materials after a pretty sizable upward revision january saw an increase over december but not nearly enough to make up for the decline in december as we can see in the 2 and 3 month windows it is an overall healthier picture with partial recoveries in the above 6 categories still way down in the 2 and 3 month windows but this was offset by a huge collapse in auto sales in january had autos remained flat the headline ex food gas growth would have been up 1 25 not 0 75 the â advanceâ i e super unreliable february retail report paints a picture of more woe for the general clothing and miscellaneous categories but the biggest contributor was building materials a previous area of strength down 4 47 had it remained flat headline ex food gas would have been up 0 15 not down 0 23 the good news in the report came in the form of a small rebound in autos and non store though both still well down in the 2 3 and 4 month windows so putting it all together it seems like consumers are holding off on large purchases of durables and saving that money instead letâ s see what effect this has had on wholesale and retail inventories inventories first looking at the 2018 quarterly numbers we can see that wholesale and retail inventories rose about 42 billion 2012 chained dollars in the last 2 quarters a 3 increase likely hoping to get out in front of the end of the year tariff increase that never came bea unfortunately the demand especially in durables has not been there the entirety of the slack in wholesale and retail comes in wholesale durables and retail autos â 45 billion 2012 chained dollars â an 8 43 increase year over year bea letâ s look at the monthly wholesale numbers for some more detail here weâ re going to be looking at the inventory to sales ratios here which is exactly what it sounds like a rising ratio means inventories are outpacing sales and prices and margins should decline in response also vice versa the buildup began in july and has continued through january jul aug sep oct nov dec jan 6 month growth durables 1 58 1 58 1 60 1 63 1 66 1 68 1 69 6 96 autos 1 53 1 57 1 62 1 68 1 67 1 72 1 70 11 11 furniture 1 83 1 81 1 83 1 90 2 00 1 94 1 91 4 37 household appliances 1 06 1 03 1 04 1 07 1 11 1 11 1 17 10 38 hardware 2 01 2 09 2 06 2 12 2 14 2 24 2 24 11 44 clothing 2 15 2 12 2 20 2 29 2 24 2 30 2 35 9 30 click to enlarge bea iâ ve added clothing in there since we saw the weakness in retail and indeed inventories grow there too but other than autos the problem is still with wholesalers not retailers or manufacturers while non auto retailers have seen weakness since december and the preliminary january and february industrial output numbers for consumer durables are way off they have managed their inventories much better additionally we are now beginning to see the effects in the employment numbers with the preliminary i e super unreliable labor department employer survey for march with lower numbers in durable manufacturing and autos particularly prices so what effect has this had on prices in the broad consumer durables category what weâ re seeing is deflated prices but they are deflating at a slower rate which is counterintuitive a little historical context is needed here since the explosion of free trade in the 1990s the consumer durables price index has been down every month but one it is one of the great benefits of free trade and nafta specifically that we all pay much less for large expensive items than we used to but since the year over year deflation rate bottomed at 3 in november 2016 it has been rising pretty steadily to be clear prices on consumer durables are still deflating just at a much slower rate now 0 94 year over year in january so even though weâ re seeing reduced demand since december it does not seem to have effected prices fred bea also breaks out the auto price index in the quarterly numbers so they are a bit stale but seasonally adjusted prices for new autos both cars and light trucks were down in q4 so whatâ s the big deal when i explain this to people i often get blank stares â 50 billion in extra inventories in a 20 trillion economy sounds like very little and it is but it also represents almost 80 of h2 2018 growth and there is no guarantee that it will be sold or sold at a profitable price and warehousing is not free in any event drawing down inventories is going to pull significant amounts out of h1 2019 growth unless it just sits there which is worse these things have a way of spiraling another take on the same data is that it is the result of a series of non recurring events bofaml expressed this view in a note before the weak advance february retail numbers came out there are several explanations for the recent weakness in spending â all of which imply a temporary lull in december the stock market stumbled creating a negative wealth shock and hurting confidence this was accompanied by the government shutdown which weighed further on confidence then the polar vortex created weather distortions in january further holding back spending most recently in february delays in tax refunds have crimped spending the census bureau data â which will be released on april 1st â are likely to show weak spending for february as well although the data have been much more volatile of late and prior months could be revised this view posits a 2016 type scenario which was specifically alluded to by jerome powell in his last speech in this scenario a combination of factors would lead to a temporary earnings recession but the fed would save the day by pivoting to a neutral stance but this doesnâ t take into account the role of the tax bill on the 2017 and 2018 recovery from the 2016 sectoral recession with the deficit over a trillion dollars this sort of fiscal stimulus will not be forthcoming again but disposable income remains strong so the dip in consumption is unusual to be clear it is a good thing that us consumers are saving more especially now at the end of the cycle but the timing coinciding with the buildup in inventories is not good however prices appear to be holding so it seems like wholesalers also think this is temporary our next big clue to how this is working out will be the preliminary q1 gdp report at the end of april the earnings recession youâ re soaking in it many economists and analysts have predicted an earnings recession in 2019 like the one in 2016 but 2018 was already an earnings recession for us corporations it has been masked by the tax billâ s effect on the year over year comps of gaap earnings up 6 32 for the year but before tax profits were down 0 17 in 2018 the tax bill also had a partial accounting effect on 2017 taxes with changes to deferred taxes and depreciation figures in billions of nominal dollars before tax profits yoy growth after tax profits yoy growth effective tax rate 2016 2 129 71 0 21 1 736 85 0 01 18 45 2017 2 181 87 2 45 1 831 17 5 43 16 07 2018 2 178 19 0 17 1 946 89 6 32 10 62 click to enlarge fred since this is nominal dollars you can lop another 1 5 2 off those yoy growth rates now that the year over year effects of the tax bill on after tax profits are gone in 2019 gaap earnings will follow and will likely be down for the year as global demand slows and the us seems to be following appleâ s aapl earnings call at the beginning of may will certainly wake up everyone to this fact if their guidance and fedexâ fdx havenâ t already i think the q1 numbers we start getting in a few weeks are going to have a lot of surprises on the downside liquidity youâ re drowning in it when i was positioning my accounts for q1 the thing that i underestimated is how much the sea of liquidity we have been soaking in over the past decade has effected sentiment the only news that seems to interest investors these days is central bank liquidity and how much they can fill up on as is typical at the end of cycles sentiment has become divorced from fundamentals in the past it has usually been investors chasing growth like in 1999 or yield like in 2006 now everyone chases any signs of liquidity in the system whether they understand what that means or not demand for us treasuries remains very high despite all time record supply because many investors see an interest rate just above inflation as the best use of their capital no amount of added liquidity is going to change that i will get into it in greater detail below when discussing how the tax bill worked out in 2018 but the surge in buybacks is clear evidence that companies donâ t believe investing in new capacity with all this liquidity is a very good bet they have generated record amounts of cash and as we will see are returning all of it to investors some companies are even taking out debt at historically low rates to do buybacks essentially raiding their own balance sheets this is a version of the liquidity trap that keynes originally described in his telling when interest rates hit the lower bound investors prefer cash to bonds and stop buying driving rates back up when the central bank is trying to keep them low in this version letâ s call it lt2 0 the system is awash with liquidity but the growth in the system doesnâ t seem as attractive as a 6 month bill at 2 45 yield or a 3 year bond at 2 26 or the 10 year bund at 0 041 or buying your own shares so the central bank loses the ability to juice the real economy with cuts to the lower bound and only inflates asset prices japan is the prime example as it happened to them first back in the mid 1990s when the rest of the world was booming fred real gdp growth blue line right axis was up and down a lot but their 24 year real gdp cagr is a meager 0 95 this is a period where the overnight rate for the boj red line left axis never got above 100 bps the inflation rate green line left axis was negative most years and the 10 year government bond purple line left axis eventually hit zero in 2016 at the end of 2018 gdp growth 0 80 inflation 0 02 overnight boj rate 0 30 10 year government bond 0 065 this can all be ours if we are not careful the fed pausing at 240 bps means we do not have very far to go to zero if we need to in 2008 we came into that recession with about 500 bps to zero already an historically low number for the end of a cycle and that was clearly not enough the ending of the balance sheet runoff is actually a backdoor qe4 as the fed will have to purchase new treasuries to replace expiring paper further increasing demand for treasuries and driving rates lower but back to where i started this section equity markets are obviously gaga over rate cuts even though the experience of the past decades tells us that they have diminishing returns the closer you get to zero the outsized performance in us equities in q1 is unmoored from either the performance of the economy as a whole or corporate profits in particular liquidity can only keep it afloat for so long until we all drown in it the tax bill a year in the 2017 gop tax bill was designed to add 1 5 trillion to the debt though i would argue the final number will be much larger due to the pass through income loophole and congress may make certain expiring cuts permanent forgetting for a moment that this represents an unprecedented transfer payment from future generations to current shareholders it is also an unprecedented experiment in fiscal stimulus at the end of what was already a long cycle it s bizarro keynesian we now have a price tag on the corporate side of the bill so far through 2018â s end 220 billion in new federal debt in billions of nominal dollars after tax corporate profits effective tax rate corporate tax paid corporate tax at 2016 effective rate difference 2016 1 736 85 18 446 392 86 392 86 0 00 2017 1 831 17 16 073 350 70 402 48 51 78 2018 1 946 89 10 619 231 31 401 80 170 49 total 222 27 click to enlarge bea as i pointed out there were changes that effected deferred taxes in 2017 taxes reducing the effective rate by over 2 and then another 6 in 2018 i hope we get our moneyâ s worth but counter the supply siders companies will take this extra cash and plow it back into the business in the form of capital expenditure this will lead to long term growth in productivity which will translate into both higher profits and wages leading to higher demand leading to more capex etc the budget deficit gets wiped out by growth and everyone sings kumbaya let s look at this argument one step at a time lower statutory corporate tax rates lead to higher profits higher profits lead to higher capital expenditures higher capital expenditures increases worker productivity higher worker productivity leads to higher profits and wages higher wages increases demand higher profits and demand increases capital expenditures the growth from this virtuous cycle wipes out the deficit we have already seen that corporate after tax profits rose by over 6 even though pre tax profits were actually down so cash flows to corporations rose in 2018 but did that lead to higher investment the answer is â a littleâ the 10 year window dotted line is the median fred those are annual numbers but i think we are about to see weakness creep back into investment numbers since july new capital goods ex defense aircraft orders are down at a compounded rate of 0 20 monthly or 2 42 annualized those are based on seasonally adjusted nominal dollars so you can take another 1 6 off the annual number weâ re seeing a slight above median bump in investment that is likely dissipating as i type this but where did the profits go if not to an investment boom for the s p 500 companies in 2018 in billions of nominal dollars gaap earnings buybacks dividends combined yield net cash percent of total net income to shareholders 1 266 20 806 43 456 30 5 25 3 46 99 73 click to enlarge s p so all of it went back to shareholders as discussed above increased fiscal and central bank liquidity are not having their intended effects on investment behavior to put this in context all us companies spent an additional 251 billion in nominal dollars over 2017 on all fixed investment in all of 2018 instead of adding to that just the s p 500 companies chose to return 1 26 trillion to shareholders a 324 billion increase over 2017 the previous record year this should tell you everything you need to know about how corporate leadership view organic earnings growth prospects moreover this is nothing new it has been going on since 2014 in those five years buybacks and dividends for the s p 500 totaled 106 of gaap earnings for a net cash flow of 296 billion in nominal dollars these 500 companies went into a combined 296 billion in new debt to fund this instead of using those earnings and low interest rates to increase capex to be clear i am not railing against buybacks when cash flows justify it returning cash to shareholders is a good thing but borrowing 296 billion to return to shareholders is merely raiding the balance sheet and it is up the investors of those companies to reject this tactic to date they have not did the slightly higher investment lead to higher productivity again just a little fred is this leading to personal income growth yet again just a little fred weâ ve already seen that personal consumption expenditures are declining off their q2 peaks so this small bump in personal income is not going into increased demand and we are unlikely to start the virtuous cycle predicted by the supply siders and the budget deficit the budget deficit was 779 billion but thatâ s masking another 476 billion in other off budget federal borrowing so the total federal debt ballooned by 1 25 trillion in 2018 170 billion alone from the hole in corporate income taxes or 14 of the total total debt is now over 107 of gdp a new record eclipsing the worst years of the recovery the really bad news is now the left has their own magical budgetary thinking in the form of modern monetary theory may god have mercy on our souls tax season is upon us and by june we will be able to issue a final report card on the individual side of the bill if you want to know where thatâ s headed google â kansas experiment â fun fact trumpâ s latest fomc nominee tv â economistâ stephen moore was one of the architects of that disaster so the report card for the corporate side of the tax bill a year in d ask your kids or grandkids if the 1 5 trillion they borrowed was worth it the yield curve and the next recession recessions are notoriously difficult to call at first and usually we donâ t know until a quarter or two after itâ s already started for example in the last go around then cnbc talking head and current white house chief economic advisor larry kudlow had this to say when we were already in recession in december 2007 there is no recession despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas the resilient u s economy continues moving ahead â quarter after quarter year after yearâ defying dire forecasts and delivering positive growth in fact we are about to enter the seventh consecutive year of the bush boomâ thereâ s no recession coming the pessimistas were wrong itâ s not going to happen at a bare minimum we are looking at goldilocks 2 0 and thatâ s a minimum goldilocks is alive and well the bush boom is alive and well itâ s finishing up its sixth consecutive year with more to come yes itâ s still the greatest story never told this is not to pick on kudlow because many many smart people and computer models got this one wrong too so donâ t trust anyoneâ s recession predictions including mine that being said here we go iâ ll have a lot more to say about this in my next yield curve update but the yield curve has proven to be a pretty decent predictor of recession to be clear while it has a big effect on the financial sector curve inversions are a symptom not the cause of recessions when investors think recession is coming they believe the fed will lower rates in the future so long term rates drop while short term rates hold up for example the 2 10 spread fred the big caveat here is the extremely small sample size but it does look good on a chart no my own model currently predicts the 2 10 will invert on august 26 with recession to start anywhere from 6 months to 2 years after so the earliest would be february 2020 the ny fedâ s yield curve model uses the 3 month to 10 year spread over a normalized distribution to generate a probability of recession a year out the historical chart ny fed as you can see at the end there the probability has jumped as the spread has plummeted since the beginning of november inverting for 5 days at the end of march though it has pulled back considerably in april the fed publishes the 1 month moving average but i also keep track of the daily value which peaked at 28 5 for march 27 2020 currently at 25 8 for april 5 2020 to put that in context the back testing of the start dates of previous recessions 1960 7 7 1970 36 7 1973 10 3 1980 43 3 1990 31 1 2001 26 2 2008 37 9 so getting close performance and positioning at the beginning of december i switched my positioning to watch and wait which was about 30 long and 30 short for a net long exposure of zero over the last 4 months this has changed a bit mostly because i bought a lot of fortress transport ftai at 8 3 yield right before it went ex dividend and then sold it after right now iâ m at about 20 long and 20 short still at net zero i havenâ t begun shorting individual stocks but i am keeping a close eye on the large banks and will probably begin shorting them soon they are usually the leading edge of any sort of recession and the flattening of the yield curve will impact a large part of their business which is borrowing short term and lending long term i just bought a new car and was offered a 6 year loan at 2 65 only 25 bps above fed funds which is a very thin margin for the bank anyway iâ m keeping a close eye on bny mellon bk and citibank c so as a hedge i had been using spxu a triple leveraged inverse s p 500 etf but once the vix index slipped below 13 a few weeks ago i swapped that out for uvxy uvxy a vix index tracking etf i prefer the vix hedge because when itâ s this low there is much less downside risk than spxu spxu to be clear with leveraged products like these you do not need to fill up for example to hedge my current 20 long position i only have 5 6 uvxy also uvxy is a special case â never own it for more than 4 weeks in any event performance lagged the s p considerably this past quarter but still up 7 compared to 13 for the index a lot of that came in interest and dividends and short term gains so not particularly tax friendly in any event i continue to believe that the risk in the system is not worth the potential gains from added long exposure to equities the s p closed the quarter at 2834 if the market really rallies on the back of a trade deal with china for example to 3100 weâ re still only talking about about 9 gain meanwhile i see a lot of empty air underneath us remember wile e coyote stays aloft until he looks down outlook in case you skipped the liquidity section go back and read it iâ ll wait but for the rest of you hereâ s an adorable bear cub to look atâ pxhere there is a tug of war happening right now the fundamentals are souring everywhere you look at the beginning of 2019 yet equities surged globally in response to increased central bank liquidity and what people believe that means but as we saw up top these valuations are not justified by the growth of the economy generally or corporate profits specifically the entire point of increased central bank liquidity is to reduce the cost of capital so that marginal or high risk reward investments go from thumbs down to thumbs up but thatâ s not whatâ s happening outside of ip investment fixed investment growth and productivity growth have been moderate at best so where is all this capital going first to the tune of an additional 1 25 trillion in 2018 it is going to fund the federal debt at rates barely above inflation that should tell you what investors think about other opportunities second at least for the s p 500 companies the increased cash flows they are generating from all this liquidity is going back to shareholders some companies are even issuing debt to return cash to shareholders raiding their own balance sheets because long term rates are so low again there doesnâ t seem to be much interest in investing in new capacity finally with the increased savings rate consumers put an extra 300 billion in the bank during december and january compared what they would have at the old rate so right now we are floating on a sea of global central bank liquidity but soon like japan we may start drowning in it germany looks like theyâ re headed there fred at the end of 2018 gdp growth 1 45 inflation 1 28 overnight rate 0 36 yes negative since 2015 10 year government bond 0 40 this can all be ours i am still a fat bear beadnose 2018 fat bear champion and my spirit animal katmai national park for several years now the rangers at katmai national park in alaska have promoted fat bear week the week before the bears go off to hibernate they compare pictures of the bears from spring when they first emerged from their hibernation all skinny and ready to feast with their current huge girth after a summer of salmon so i am still hibernating in my cave and here i remain until the glaciers begin to melt and the salmon swim upstream all bear markets end and when it does i will emerge ready to fatten up in the river only half joking i will end on joke i have been telling since the triple whammy to globalism of brexit corbyn trump the right is turning nationalist the left is turning socialist and the us is foisting a trade war on the rest of the world that no one wants does that sound like the 1930s to you because it sounds like the 1930s to me iâ m only half joking thanks for reading comments questions insults have at it
3 april 2019 back in 2008 2009 when global financial markets plunged into turmoil many asian economies turned to their domestic consumers for help 1 over the next 10 years asian consumers especially those in emerging markets in the region ratcheted up spending aiding not only their economies but also world growth 2 now as a new year starts global financial markets have turned choppy yet again with uncertainties related to trade and globalization adding to the confusion 3 will asian consumers come to the rescue of their region again especially if global gdp and trade growth slump a quick look at key consumer indicators in asia reveals that consumers in the region may not be able to pitch in as much as they did nearly a decade ago 4 they appear to be holding back as they await the turn of economic events at home and worldwide taking on water one piece of economic news early in 2019 best sums up the concern about the state of consumers in asia car sales in the world s largest auto market china not the united states fell by 5 8 percent in 2018 the first decline in 20 years 5 the news follows a year of slowing economic activity in the country with real gdp growth declining to 6 7 percent average in the first three quarters of 2018 from an annual average of 8 1 percent in the previous 10 years the slowdown in growth has impacted consumer spending growth in retail sales value and volume and nominal household spending fell in 2018 compared to previous years china is not alone when it comes to worries about consumer demand in neighboring india consumer spending growth has slowed since a ban on old currency notes in end 2016 and after the introduction of a new goods and services tax in 2017 6 in japan years of monetary stimulus through quantitative easing haven t brought about the kind of changes in consumer demand and wage increase that the bank of japan would have hoped for 7 in other asian economies too consumers appear to be under pressure in indonesia for example growth in consumer spending is on a broad downward trend while in south korea spending growth has been declining since q1 2018 what s bothering asian consumers slowing consumer momentum in asia since last year does not come as a surprise given global and regional economic trends global growth has slowed thereby likely weighing on consumer confidence in its most recent update the world bank has forecasted global economic growth to slow to 2 9 percent in 2019 from a downwardly revised 3 0 percent in 2018 growth is expected to slow this year in china thailand and vietnam while remaining lackluster in japan 8 headwinds in international trade emanating from slowing global growth and policy related issues such as the current us china trade tiff will further trouble key asian exporters this year 9 the year 2018 also witnessed a surge in the us dollar due to the reversal of global liquidity from emerging markets as investors sought higher yields in the united states thanks to the rate hikes by the federal reserve 10 this meant that key emerging market currencies in asia took a battering figure 1 this not only tested market sentiment in the region but also raised the risks of imported inflation inflation had another ally in the first half of 2018 rising oil prices consumers in oil importing countries in asia such as india which had tried to move away from years of subsidized oil prices to a more market driven mechanism had to bear the brunt of rising prices global financial volatility also left its mark on asian financial markets key equity indices either posted losses in 2018 figure 2 or shed their gains from the previous year this in turn dented the equity component of household wealth a key contributor to consumer spending equity investors will likely be in wait and watch territory as they focus on the outcome of us china trade talks signs of global growth revival and results of elections in 2019 in markets such as india and indonesia the other key asset of households housing posted mixed results growth in house prices dipped in india and malaysia while in singapore and thailand prices went up after suffering declines in 2017 in hong kong and parts of china the elevated level of home prices may well mean that some consumers have stayed away from the housing market thereby losing out on the addition of an important asset to their wealth portfolio overall with household wealth under pressure likely from both equities and housing the boost to consumer spending from wealth is likely to weaken in asia in the near term consumers will also likely be wary of indulging in a credit binge as happened after the downturn of 2008 2009 when key economies loosened monetary policy to encourage domestic consumption that spree of monetary easing led to high household debt in many parts of asia figure 3 with such elevated debt levels many consumers in these economies may either be trying to deleverage or keep tabs on their spending also as compared to a decade back credit conditions do not seem conducive for a spending rise in some economies in india for example the rise in nonperforming assets in the banking system has weighed on credit growth 11 and in china efforts to curb shadow banking will continue to weigh on any recent moves to prop up credit 12 is it all gloom and doom then not really consumer spending in asia may be under pressure now but policymakers can draw strength from favorable medium to long term economic prospects the region is likely to continue growing at a healthy pace the international monetary fund imf expects developing and emerging asia to grow by 6 3 percent annually on average in 2019 2024 the corresponding forecasted growth for the association of southeast asian nations commonly referred to as asean is 5 2 percent 13 and even though the imf expects china s growth to decline in that period the forecasted annual average of 5 9 percent is nevertheless a healthy one 14 healthy growth expected over the next decade will likely aid consumer incomes in asia forecasts by oxford economics for example point to strong growth in personal incomes for key asian economies over the next 10 years figure 4 and as more people come out of poverty in the region and scale up the income ladder the size of the middle class will also surge for example the middle class population in the asia pacific region is expected to make up nearly 66 percent of the global middle class population by 2030 up from 28 percent in 2009 15 add to this mix a young population16 japan is one exception and one

reduction in purchasing power there are a few contrarians who think that deflation is coming both monetary deflation and price deflation as far as i know there are only about a dozen of them who write newsletters or run websites for some reason most of the deflationists seem to think that gold s price will rise in a mass deflation they do not warn their subscribers don t buy gold or silver if they did they would have fewer subscribers robert prechter has never joined this camp he started predicting 125 gold at least 15 years ago he is consistent the other deflationists are either inconsistent or silent on the gold question in contrast i think gold s price will rise because the money supply will rise i recommend that your first 10 000 in gold be purchased as one ounce coins american eagles are more expensive than krugerrands eagles by law are designated as numismatic coins in 1933 when the u s government confiscated gold coins and bullion it exempted numismatic coins if you are worried about gold confiscation i am not then the eagles make some sense but you get more gold for your buck with krugerrands on these and other precious money issues click here why gold s price should rise in the face of falling prices including all other commodity prices remains a mystery to the rest of us gold bugs the original deflationist j irving weiss announced a looming price deflation in 1967 at harry schultz s original gold conference i was there he told us to buy t bills i bought gold coins instead since then american prices have risen by about six to one he remains the model deflationist he never retracted his prediction over the next three decades his son martin continues to announce it but the father had an excuse for his blindness he had borrowed 500 from his mother in 1929 and turned it into 100 000 by 1931 he had made his fortune in the classic bear market of all time and he never figured out that this was a once in a career opportunity the great depression dipped his investment strategy in cement here i am talking about hard core inflationists most of them favor gold over silver a few prefer silver over gold for their core holdings i am not one of them let me tell you why the de monetization of silver in june 1963 the government passed legislation severing the legal connection between silver certificates and silver no longer could you take in a silver certificate to the u s treasury and get a fixed number of ounces of silver i could see exactly what was coming gresham s law was about to be re confirmed bad money drives good money out of circulation that is the government overvalued money drives out of circulation the government undervalued money i began buying silver coins the next month with my first full time paycheck i made 500 a month and by september i had bought over 1 000 in silver coins i believed in thrift i bought them because the local bank had silver coins i kept buying more every paycheck i remember a teller a young woman who told me you can always get coins why do you want to buy so many of them i don t recall what i told her i doubt that i explained federal reserve policy and gresham s law to her technically the bank had to provide coins for me on request they had only silver coins other than pennies and nickels i knew what would come soon clad coins they did by october silver coins were going out of circulation there was a shortage on the turnpikes for making change there were no clad coins yet they came in 1964 so dimes quarters and fifty cent pieces were in short supply that was the de monetization of silver collectors removed them from circulation occasionally we would find a silver coin among the legally authorized slugs but not often after 1966 the public did not know the difference there was no outcry against the government for having legislated this gigantic counterfeiting operation copper coins with shiny laminate on them were just fine with the average joe beginning around 1968 gold began to be demanded in ever greater quantities by foreign governments especially france this had been going on steadily for a decade the johnson administration attempted several counter measures such as a two tier gold price one for the european free market in gold and the other for central banks to buy american gold nothing worked finally nixon unilaterally ended gold convertibility in 1971 which destroyed the 1944 bretton woods agreement central banks use of the dollar as their reserve currency with the dollar redeemable in gold at 35 oz but only by national governments and central banks the central banks still kept their interest bearing t bills and other dollar denominated assets as part of their legal reserves they kept gold too but from 1971 on they still bought mainly dollar denominated assets not gold this is true today the dollar has never lost its reserve currency status despite the closing of the gold window the bankers ignored this semi final de monetization of gold in 1971 in much the same way that americans ignored the final de monetization of silver in 1963 i say semi final why not final because the u s government did not immediately sell off its gold hoard in 1971 most central banks have refused to sell all of their gold they have generally ceased buying newly mined gold or gold from the free market but they do buy gold bullion from each other some of them have sold off part of their gold supplies but this has been done mainly since the mid 1980 s silver in contrast has been completely de monetized it is an industrial metal or a jewelry metal its price peaked in january 1980 at 50 an ounce it then fell for the next 23 years bottoming at 4 67 in january 2003 that was a 90 loss of price but really closer to 94 because of the fall in the dollar s value 1980 2003 in short silver was an investment catastrophe for over 20 years gold is perceived as a money metal that is used by central banks it is used by asians as an inflation hedge silver has lost that perceived value so silver is more volatile there was nothing to prevent its fall after 1980 there is something else to consider for almost the entire 23 years of its price decline there were bullish silver brokers who kept talking about the huge gap between low silver production and high silver consumption here is my question if that argument led to losses for 23 years why should anyone believe the same argument today there was a negative correlation for most of those 23 years between that argument and the price of silver the official figures for demand and supply remain steady year after year from 770 million ounces to 900 million ounces see the figures for 1995 2004 i have seen no plausible explanation for the fact that for 23 years a metal that was being consumed out of unknown storehouses could keep falling in price if the publicly available supply demand statistics were that impossible for that long a period silver supplies by the hundreds of millions of ounces per year coming from above ground sources where then why should anyone trust price forecasts based on today s supply demand statistics until a silver bull can explain clearly from verifiable evidence the origin of the silver held in above ground sources at least 200 million ounces per year every year for 25 years i will pay no attention to the argument how was it that above ground supplies did not decline in availability despite a 94 decline in silver s real price when you hear this argument be polite but ignore it do not invest a clad dime based on this argument the gold leasing operation for at least a decade central banks have been lending gold to specialized brokerage firms called bullion banks the bullion banks borrow this gold at absurdly low interest rates well under 1 per year then they sell this borrowed gold into the world s private gold markets this keeps down the price of gold added supply the bullion banks then take the money they earn from the sale of this borrowed gold and purchase higher yielding debt certificates they may get 6 so they are borrowed short the low lease rate and lent long bonds they owe gold not money the central banks still list this leased sold gold on their books but there is no leased gold in central banks vaults it has been leased out then sold the public believes that this gold is there but it s gone it has gone into jewelry maybe in india some daughter has her share of the central banks gold in her dowry in the form of a necklace or rings the central banks do not report that it is gone so there is always the threat that the public will figure out that the leased gold is gone but for now the politicians either are as ignorant as the public or content with the arrangement so the odds are that the public will not learn about the missing gold in any case voters are just about incapable of mounting a political attack on central banks which truly are untouchable politically but the fact remains that the banks have depleted their hoards of gold so their ability to push down the price of the gold is becoming more limited central banks have not announced lately the usual warning we are going to sell gold over the next few months of course no profit seeking owner of a commodity ever announces his plan to sell that would depress the price he wants to maximize the sale price in contrast central bankers do make these announcements this indicates that their profits come from other sources one such profit source is political the public s perception that monetary policy is sound a fact testified to by the fact that gold s price has not risen much the central bankers are temporarily buying the illusion of price stability a lower gold price this perception is now changing as gold s price keeps rising yet the kitty is depleted the gold has been leased then sold there may be some future announcements of some central bank s looming gold sales but the silence so far has been deafening so the gold overhang of the central banks is no longer the sword of damocles it is more like the switchblade knife of damocles the central banks now face a major problem if gold s price gets too high the private bullion banks will be trapped they owe gold to central banks but they cannot afford to buy gold in the private markets in order to repay it to the central banks if they are ever asked to repay they will go bankrupt the central banks therefore will face exposure as being in collusion with a bunch of profit seeking enrons busted and owing the government s gold to the central banks my guess is that central bankers knew from the beginning that they would never see this gold again they just wanted a cover leasing rather than sales of the government s gold the downward pressure on gold is today no longer so great as it was a decade ago the threat is reduced because the vaults are less full no central bank holds silver as a monetary reserve no central bank is committed to buying or selling silver for public perception reasons silver has been de monetized it is no longer on the political radar so silver is closer to a true free market commodity it is therefore more subject to the ups and downs of the business cycle you can make more money in silver when the market rises no overhang of leased silver in central bank vaults you can also lose more money when silver falls along with the economy no central bank buying of silver finally if the bullion banks are ever asked to repay the gold the gold bullion market faces a day of reckoning massive buying by shorts bullion banks or else the widespread awareness that central banks do not have as much gold to sell off to keep down its price both events would drive up the price of gold there is no comparable upward pressure for silver the gold silver ratio there was a close correlation for many decades 15 to one that was because this ratio was set by federal law it was a price control gresham s law always took over the overvalued metal would drive out of circulation the undervalued metal for as long as the government would supply the undervalued metal the coins would circulate side by side but when the gold silver ratio diverged too much from 15 to one speculators would buy up the coins of the undervalued metal and ship them abroad or melt them down for their value as metal higher rather than money lower to find today s ratio divide the price of gold by the price of silver it is nowhere close to 15 to one in 1963 when silver went out of circulation silver was about 1 30 while gold was 35 that was 27 to one before 1963 silver s price was lower so the ratio was higher but the ratio did not matter gold s price was a fake price americans were not legally allowed to own gold bullion so silver circulated gold didn t then in 1963 it became profitable to buy silver coins and hoard them or melt them down silver coins disappeared again the gold silver ratio as a forecasting tool produced only losses 1980 to 2003 silver s market price fell by 90 gold s price fell by 70 the gold silver ratio increased when you discover an alleged semi fixed price ratio that produces forecasting errors for 23 years it is best to avoid adopting it as your precious metals allocation strategy in any given 12 month period and you can t be sure which 12 months the price of gold or silver may rise or fall by a greater percentage than the other it does no good to trade back and forth given the income tax consequences you may do it once but let it go at that storage problems the best way to buy silver is to buy 90 silver coins pre 1964 take delivery the sack of coins weighs over 56 pounds get them divided into two bags i recommend dimes more transactions per bag but it doesn t matter that much unless there is a complete monetary breakdown gold coins are far more versatile that is because they are worth more per unit of weight and volume they are easier to hide they are easier to move across a border originally published on february 8 2006 part 2 i published my report on buy silver or gold on february 7 by the end of the week long time silver bull franklin sanders responded on february 8 i published sanders article and my paragraph by paragraph response unless you are invested in gold and or silver the details of this debate may not interest you enough to read a long debate but you should at least know about its existence it is a debate over this question will above ground supplies of silver run low before above ground supplies of gold gold actually available to the market run low i answer in the negative sanders answers in the positive it is also a debate over this question in a time of an unexpected level of price inflation or after a terrorist attack is the demand for silver likely to exceed the demand for gold i answer in the negative sanders answers in the positive finally it is a debate over this question during a recession is silver s price likely to fall by a greater percentage than gold s price i answer in the positive sanders answers in the negative i think a recession is coming next year and maybe late this year this is not written in dry cement yet wet cement yes hi yo silver those of us who are old enough to remember fred foy s introduction to every lone ranger episode remember that famous phrase yet in the history of silver this phrase has applied only once 1979 that momentous incomparable opportunity to make potfuls of money ended with the worst bloodletting in modern commodity history to understand what happened take a look at the chart of silver s prices from 1792 to the present go to this page then go to yearly silver charts click the box for 1792 present and then view charts from 1792 to 1972 silver went essentially nowhere 180 years of no profits for silver investors then silver began moving up i began selling silver as an agent of a broker monex in 1973 i did this for less than a year then i went into writing full time in 1979 silver spiked upward by 10 to one it hit 50 oz in january 1980 there had never been anything like this before in silver s history then beginning in mid january 1980 it fell like a stone it kept falling until 1991 when it bottomed at 3 60 search long and hard you will not find anything to match the spike in silver s chart what happened bunker hunt happened the multibillionaire oil man started buying silver futures contracts in 1973 he kept accumulating contracts pyramiding them using profits in his position to buy more contracts he then started demanding delivery in 1979 when the price of silver was 5 demanding delivery of actual commodities is rarely done in the commodity futures market those who have gone long buyers of future commodities buy an offsetting short position and take delivery of their money there are vastly more futures contracts promising to deliver any commodity than there are supplies of this commodity some of those speculators who were short silver saw a crisis looming no silver to deliver they sold their positions they did this by buying long positions which drove up the price it was domino time for silver shorts all through 1979 hunt was trying to corner the market on silver as a multibillionaire he was feared he might be able to do it investors thought they were wrong two things happened to stop him first the fed reversed policy in october 1979 from monetary inflation to monetary stability tight money interest rates began to skyrocket the end of double digit price inflation was imminent second the commodity exchange changed the rules no one was allowed to buy long contracts except to cover existing short contracts demand for silver futures contracts died overnight this caused the peak price in january then down went silver hunt could not cover his pyramided long positions the commodity exchange sued to collect the fed intervened and provided a billion dollar loan to hunt to give him time to liquidate his oil holdings and meet his silver contracts obligations he had to collateralize this loan with his oil holdings hunt and his brother soon went bankrupt he had to liquidate everything except his home which was protected by the texas homestead law all that remained was his famous quip regarding the billion dollar loan a billion dollars just doesn t go as far as it used to newcomers to the silver market may not remember what has gone before silver is approaching 10 now up from 3 60 in 1991 that is a nice move upward it began before gold s move in april 2001 the two metals have moved up in tandem since then the question is will this continue i think it will but not in lock step if we get a recession the upward move could easily reverse with the inverted yield curve almost here a recession looks likely for 2007 only the fed can lower this risk by inflating which it is now doing all that silver is almost gone there is a story that the u s government at one time owned 1 5 billion ounces of silver it no longer does or so the story goes it is not clear exactly when it was sold or how or to whom you get different stories from different silver bulls there should be only one story the government sold it into the market at particular times at particular prices in specific quantities there must be public records if there are then we know when it was sold if there aren t then all we have is a really good sales brochure story the standard account is provided by the silver users association in 1970 the government authorized the sale of its remaining silver hoard which was converted into commemorative coins by the early 1980 s the government had sold off all but 139 million ounces of its silver this was finally sold by 2000 by the end of 2000 silver s price was down to a little over 4 50 the following december it bottomed at 4 10 it began its upward move one month after the retroactive official end of the 2001 recession it ended 2002 at 4 75 silver users could buy all they wanted from above ground supplies just as they had been able to do since 1980 it is always the same story among silver bulls next year silver will be in short supply i ask why was this story wrong for over two decades when hunt began buying the price of silver responded rapidly by late 1979 people were selling their silverware to silver users who were melting down these spoons and forks if there was any silver in the world to sell people were selling it to commercial silver users this is why the familiar story of the hundreds of supposed hundreds of millions of ounces of silver serving as an overhang 1968 2001 is not credible apart from specific evidence that it was being sold into the market by the government in dribbles and drabbles all the way up and all the way down if a specific quantity of any commodity is available for sale then it is in people s inventories it is therefore in the market it can have no future effect on price until it gets sold off and used up to make things that leave behind no scrap it costs money to hold silver in inventory you lose any interest on the money you did not invest you pay for storage and insurance why would anyone in his right mind have held silver in inventory after 1980 only for short term reasons if speculators held 1 5 million ounces of silver inventory throughout the 1980s they were dumber than congress my point is simple only economic ignorance or the fear of an imminent cataclysm kept silver bullion hoarders from selling their silver to silver users 1980 2003 if we are now facing an imminent depletion of above ground silver supplies then the reason has to be that the poor dumb clucks who held silver bullion are at last dying off and their heirs are selling silver to users but this has been going on for years what is new when any commodity is sold to final users the inventory shifts from speculators to the final users if silver is used in jewelry it is still in buyers personal inventories if it is used for most industrial products it is still available as scrap only as the old products are junked and buried in landfill does silver cease to be in someone s available inventory it may not be in bar form it may have to be melted down and poured into bars but it is still in someone s inventory we saw this form transformation process in action in 1979 silver came out of personal inventories all over the world bunker hunt had no possibility of ever cornering the silver market even if the exchange s rules had not been changed either at 60 or 80 or 100 he would have faced the reality of the silver market demand calls forth newly available supplies which keeps prices from rising when that day arrives those who are long are trapped we are told that the comex used to have 1 5 million ounces in reserve if true this means that silver was in an easily accessed form labeled bars but the fact that these bars have been bought by silver users and converted into new forms of silver is not proof of a major decline in the quantity of above ground silver it only means that silver will be more expensive to purchase it means that converting scrap silver to bars of silver will have to be paid for this will mean a rising price for silver if demand continues to rise but not necessarily a spectacular increase it is not that purchased silver has disappeared it is only that it has moved from owners who hold it for commercial purposes to owners who use it for decoration silver users are not fools they have more incentive to monitor statistics relating to silver than almost anyone else does yes they have bid up the price of silver since april 2003 when it bottomed for the year at 4 37 silver has had a nice move upward but let us not mistake a move that was preceded by gold s move by two years as some sort of alarm bell on an imminent shortage of silver here is my main point i have heard this same argument about silver s imminent shortage ever since 1973 when i sold silver for a living all through the early 1980 s silver guru emeritus jerome smith told people in a series of books that 50 silver was only the tip of the iceberg that silver would be at 100 an ounce by 1986 and on and on it was all nonsense silver was headed for 3 60 when a wise man hears the same argument used over and over decade after decade to buy silver yet the price only once has moved far out of a trading range of a few dollars then he grows suspicious every time he hears the argument gold is a safer bet than silver i am a gold bug this means that i believe that the dollar price of gold will eventually rise because the purchasing power of the dollar will decline by a much greater percentage than is presently expected by conventional investors price inflation alone will not drive up the price of gold or silver as we can see in the prices of both metals after january 1980 there was steady price inflation and also a price collapse of both metals for two decades unexpected price inflation is the deciding factor i think the economy is getting closer to a recession so i think silver an industrial metal is more vulnerable to a decline in price than gold is which retains its status as money for central banks i warn everyone not to accept as proven the assertion that the alleged decline of inventories of silver in bar form is the same as a decline in the above ground supply of silver there is a transfer of silver going on from professional speculators few to users many there are also inventories held in bar form by silver users decade after decade part time silver speculators readers of newsletters have been assured that silver is running out that a shortage will soon emerge and prices will go up from 1792 to 1972 this was not a problem bunker hunt came and went then silver s price collapsed back to the level it had traded in since 1792 don t get your hopes up for a killing some profits yes but not until after the next recession is it better than owning fiat money a few thousand dollar s worth yes you have probably heard that warren buffett supposedly owns all that silver that he bought in 1997 139 million ounces but as a percentage of his wealth this is peanuts it is worth noting that this investment performed poorly for five years after he bought it one of the most well publicized clunkers in his career finally he probably leased out 50 million ounces i have seen it all and heard it all since 1962 and i even participated in 1973 as a silver salesman silver is always running out a new generation of part time silver speculators is always lining up conclusion easy street is not paved with silver contrary to william jennings bryan in 1896 1900 and 1908 bunker hunt 1973 80 and jerome smith 1982 198 who has long since disappeared there is a time to buy and a time to sell when recessions loom ahead it is best to sit on the sidelines unless the fed is pumping hard as it is today or unless a major terrorist attack occurs in the united states or unless some nation bombs iran none of this has much to do with an alleged imminent shortage of silver originally posted on february 15 2006 ____________________________ the originals are here part 1 part 2 price of silver on february 5 2006 9

ended with juan guaidó s miserable and silent return to caracas and the capture of the four commanders of the ragtag venezuelan liberation army 1 currently in the tona region in the colombian department of santander the antennas of the cia and the colombian officers of the combined military intelligence and counterintelligence j2 continue preparations to set up a subversive focus in the venezuelan states of tachira zulia amazonas and apure the aim is to promote a civil war which would then involve colombia and therefore the immediate military intervention of the united states based on this on march 4 u s vice president mike pence returned to the attack recalling president donald trump continues firmly convinced of the urgent need to depose the government led by nicolás maduro even with a military solution 2 and without international authorization colombian generals dissent from u s plan this scandalous statement was not appreciated even by the lackeys of the lima group 3 which again saw dissent from the brazilian and argentinian generals and also the disagreement of many colombian senior officers in fact on feb 25 the vice president of brazil gen hamilton mourão present at the meeting of the lima group held in the colombian capital bogota reaffirmed to the amazed mike pence the contrary position of the brazilian military general mourão himself had earlier announced support for the first time on jan 23 immediately after coronation of juan guaidó with the title of interim president pronouncement undermined the white house s belligerent stance since mourão who at that time held the presidency in the absence of president jair bolsonaro ruled brazil and its armed forces will not meddle in venezuela s internal politics the position expressed by mourão at the meeting of the lima group influenced the position of the argentine generals who despite the warlike statements of argentinian president macri categorically pointed out the argentinean armed forces could only integrate a peacekeeping mission to venezuela if it were voted for and authorized by the united nations assembly in the colombian capital where the political climate is increasingly complex due to the economic crisis and the permanent state of instability caused by corruption and drug trafficking the hugs and handshakes of president iván duque márquez with vice president mike pence have not convinced the generals of general staff after the 10 year tragic experience of plan colombia no colombian officer and soldier wants to risk their lives in a difficult jungle war especially with venezuela u s southcom defines military attack as risky in fact only the explosion of a destructive civil war which threatened to damage oil infrastructure wells refineries and ports of embarkation could convince the u s congress of the need to intervene militarily in venezuela and authorize the generals of the pentagon to carry out a surgical attack against venezuela such an attack admiral craig faller head of the southern command of the u s armed forces defined as risky last october at a meeting of the senate committee on defense because the bolivarian army is structured horizontally with about 2 000 generals commanding and controlling the different sectors of territorial defense in an interview with bbc news mundo galen carpenter analyst of the conservative cato institute and specialist in international military issues underlined the risks although there may be reasons for internal division it is certain that most of the bolivarian army forces will mobilize to repel the invasion venezuelan armed forces ready this argument does not surprise the officers of the venezuelan national bolivarian armed forces fanb in fact in 2018 venezuelan gen jacinto pérez arcay 4 immediately after the decision of the bolivarian government to replace the dollar with the chinese yuan in oil sales operations presented to the general staff of the fanb and to president maduro himself a detailed study on the possible operations southcom might carry out to pave the way for a land invasion by u s troops according to pérez arcay and other sources of fanb military intelligence he first war operation of southcom would be a surgical attack with planes and missiles against the air bases of palo negro and barcelona and against the naval base of puerto cabello as former secretary of defense gen james mattis declared such a surgical aerial attack must be carried out on all military objectives in venezuela without suffering any loss in order to cause the dissolution of the organization of the venezuelan army and encourage the possible arrival of u s marines with the function of pacifying and not fighting for mattis the organic dissolution of the fanb has always been the sine qua non condition to complete the invasion of venezuela and establish a new government quickly and without serious losses for this reason mattis always warned president donald trump that without this condition the attack could become a tragic adventure according to some analysts this position repeatedly iterated by mattis was one cause for his dismissal from the position of secretary of defense by president trump generals h r mcmaster john kelly and michael flynn all hired and then fired by the president had real quarrels with donald trump because of the political and military issues related to the venezuelan issue war in the hands of the cia consequently mike pompeo the gray eminence in the trump government without the binding opinion of the generals was able to give the cia absolute responsibility for the planning and implementation of all the subversive operations necessary to cause a deep and destructive crisis in venezuela capable of destroying the resilience of nicolás maduro s government having received the clear support of many democratic countries of the european union the trump government has tripled the so called fund for the restoration of democracy in venezuela which now exceeds 120 million on top of these are the funds for the top secret operations of the cia in venezuela which according to rumors are estimated at eight hundred million dollars for the current year alone on this basis the cia has been able to strengthen its collaboration with the brazilian and colombian secret services and with military intelligence sectors in order to understand what is happening within venezuela in fact for langley s analysts it is important to know to what extent the different sectors of the opposition are still credible what kind of mobilizations they would be able to carry out and whether the conditions and the ability to create an urban subversive focus exist in the main cities of venezuela at the same time as paramilitary groups would orchestrate a rural subversive focus in the venezuelan states bordering colombia u s cybernetic terrorism underway the division within the opposition after the adventure of juan guaidó and the consequent inactivity of those opposing parties have pushed the cia to resort to the action of cybernetic terrorism which remains the only element of active conflict of this hybrid war and which is increasingly isolated from the masses in political terms including among the middle class in the last 30 days cybernetic terrorism has caused serious damage to the economy with various sabotage of electricity supply centers and transmission lines on march 7 the first national power outage was recorded it lasted 60 hours paralyzing all computer networks in the country this sabotage however failed to reduce the confidence of the majority of the population in government on the contrary the power outage has caused greater discredit to the venezuelan opposition parties especially those who support the need for immediate political change and who use all forms of struggle including violent ones for this reason and to mask the political failure president donald trump and mike pompeo re raised the flag of the military solution and stimulated psychological warfare by the media hoping to resurrect the opposition 5 u s plans hybrid war to control latin america at this point the political situation in venezuela raises three questions why do president donald trump and the neocon group even though they know that the opposition is practically delegitimized insist on urgently and at all costs deposing president maduro s government why did mike pompeo consider the subversive project formulated by the cia the progressive economic destruction of venezuela to be interesting why did john bolton dismiss the opinion of the pentagon generals according to them the development of subversive actions would strengthen maduro s position and the role of the bolivarian army annulling the peacemaking mission of u s marines and the possibility of re establishing democracy without incurring casualties to answer these questions it is necessary to resort to the analyses of some political scientists specializing in geostrategy of the dominant blocks in august 2018 brazilian professor josé luis da costa fiori 6 published an article in which he analyzed the new role of the so called hybrid war as an integral part of the geostrategic policy of the government of donald trump understood as an extreme attempt to impose u s control over all states of the latin american continent through a war of low intensity for professor fiori the term hybrid war identifies the evolution of the traditional u s military solution bombing and invasion by marines or the historic u s attempt at a coup d état with a fourth generation war in this the state department the cia and the white house coordinate a simultaneous series of attacks economic legal financial diplomatic media political psychological subversive and cybernetic with the aim of destabilizing the government of president maduro demobilizing the chavista movement and above all tearing apart the bolivarian armed forces why is u s waging hybrid war now a key element of this hybrid war was the urgency of donald trump s imperialist government to set in motion a complex multiplicity of subversive elements of low intensity war the main objective was to carry out an apparent spontaneous popular rebellion capable of absorbing the main branches of the army and the most dynamic workers sectors of the state energy and oil companies the most obvious example was the failed operation constitution the government of donald trump after the bolivarian government succeeded in circumventing most of the financial sanctions played the card of interim president hoping that the opposition would be able to achieve a color revolution and impose a new government totally dependent on the white house and the multinationals in reality the cia the state department and the white house tried to carry out a second operation maidan south of the equator 7 that code name was used for the subversive project by which the cia and the u s state department overthrew the government of ukraine the failure of the project exacerbates more and more the criticism from the u s oil companies linked to rex tillerson a manager of the multinational chevron who was hired and then fired by president trump pressure from u s oil companies and the dollar the discontent of u s oil companies is due to the fact that without the 1 3 million barrels of venezuelan oil they are now forced to import from saudi arabia at higher prices all refineries in texas used venezuelan oil before the sanctions decreed by trump against pdvsa but trump s sanctions did not paralyze pdvsa s production as opec fixed new production quotas with higher prices china and india immediately signed new purchase contracts with pdvsa buying all the quantities of oil that were previously destined for the u s through citgo petroleum corporation it should be noted that pdvsa s new contracts were not signed in dollars but in yuan the chinese currency used these days by russia china and india in bilateral trade the use of the yuan as well as the cryptocurrency created by the bolivarian government is the real reason for the white house s geostrategic urgency to destabilize maduro s government this type of trade transaction helps weaken the power of the dollar in world financial markets iraq libya and china it is also imperative to remember the u s war of aggression against iraq as well as the war against libya these when saddam hussein and then muammar al gaddafi tried to away from the dollar they sold u s debt securities to buy gold silver diamonds and then used the euros as a base currency in the sale of oil and gas we must not forget that 15 days before the humanitarian attack on libya by nato planes the bank of england appropriated libya s gold reserve denying president gaddafi the right to transfer it to the central bank of tripoli it may be a coincidence but the venezuelan government also suffered the same expropriation by the bank of england when president maduro requested the repatriation of the gold reserve of venezuela deposited in that bank since the 1970s the last for the urgency of the hybrid war concerns u s attempts to interrupt the presence of chinese and indian companies in venezuela that presence guarantees the bolivarian state new forms of wealth by exploiting numerous mineral deposits in particular those of coltan and gold 8 and the realization of large infrastructure projects this presence above all that of china the white house considers a danger since all over latin america china s companies provide a possible alternative to the rigid rules imposed by the international monetary fund and by the u s and european multinationals these companies also present enviable technological solutions that break the hegemony of the wall street conglomerates the fighting preparation of fanb immediately after the failed 2002 coup d état in venezuela president hugo chávez implemented a great geostrategic reform and restructuring of the national defense system that action was considered by all successive administrations in the white house an authentic act of war the military strengthening of the venezuelan armed forces coordinated by commander chávez himself with conflict which the united states government has accentuated in the last 10 years with the government of donald trump this latent conflict turned into a silent low intensity war however the main reason that prompted the pentagon generals to consider the bolivarian state as irrecoverable as the cuban state is strategic as well as military the new concepts of territorial defense and the new mechanisms of military organization that president hugo chávez introduced into the venezuelan armed forces wiped out with speed the organizational methodologies and theoretical concepts imported from the military academies of the united states commander chávez emulated cuba in the 1960s the venezuelan army was considered the pentagon s star pupil and presented as the model for all the armies of the south american continent however commander chávez following the experience of the cuban revolutionary armed forces far modified the entire structure of the defense system in addition to its theoretical foundations chávez invested several billion dollars to buy new technologically more advanced weapons and equip all units including the milicia with a system of the latest generation of communications this war materiel much produced by russian companies immediately after the end of the cold war exceeds the war efficiency of many military industries in the u s or the eu countries this is the case with sukhoi fighter bombers and especially the s 300vm air defense radar and missile system produced by the russian company antey almaz the most important element of the geostrategic and military reform of chávez was not only the introduction of new technologically advanced weapons but above all the structuring of the war potential on new lines of defense drawn in the country the great innovation was the creation of the command of integral aerospace defense codai the operational branch of defense subordinated in a direct line to the operational strategic command with headquarters in caracas revolutionary bolivarian soldiers with the application of a new conception of territorial defense understood as a fundamental element of the political alliance of the armed forces with the people it was easy to transform the old army subject to the despotic intentions of the oligarchies into a genuine popular army in permanent mobility to defend the sovereignty and legitimacy of the bolivarian government this condition allowed the rapid intellectual and political growth of the corps of officers and conscripts promoting the formation of a national bolivarian militia perfectly armed and organized to integrate the system of national territorial defense at the side of the fanb as in the cuban far and in all armies created to defend a revolutionary perspective the element that most distinguishes the fanb organization and structure is without doubt the political combat preparation this transforms the soldier and the officer into an active political subject who is immediately present in the evolution of the social and economic context of the country for this reason all the appeals of the opposition for a mass desertion or for a coup against the bolivarian government have failed cutting edge air defense system however the element that most irritated the pentagon generals was the decision of president nicolás maduro to install the s 300vm air defense system in all border regions in this way any attempt at penetration of venezuelan airspace by missiles spy planes or fighter bombers is immediately detected by radar that has an effective reading capacity up to 10 000 meters in height and 300 linear kilometers those who seek to violate venezuelan airspace without authorization are shot down by the anti aircraft defense system which consists of five lines of fire 1 20mm and 40mm anti aircraft guns 2 manpads igla5 portable missiles with a range of 5 000 meters m 3 missiles s 125 pechora 2m with range 20 000 m 4 missiles buk 2me with range 25 000 m 5 missiles s 300vm with range 30 000 m this defense system is the context always present in the difficult meetings of generals james mattis and john kelly with donald trump and mike pompeo as they discuss carrying out a surgical bombardment to destroy strategic objectives in venezuela trump and pompeo having no knowledge of military technology have never understood that given the creation by the venezuelan codai of an efficient area of aerial exclusion notam a0 160 19 it would be extremely risky to carry out aerial bombing missions all venezuelan air space is protected by s 300vm missiles including maritime air space extending to the islands of curaçao aruba and bonaire venezuelan radars perfectly control air activity more than 100 kilometres from their borders in particular they defend the airspace of the colombian region of cucuta and the brazilian region of pacaraima which according to the subversive plan operation constitution were to have been the starting point of the projected u s invasion masked thus president maduro following the orientation of hugo chávez has completed the protection of all venezuelan air space with a genuine umbrella armed with anti aircraft missiles guided by powerful russian radars able to cancel up to 300 kilometers any type of electronic interference at this point given the impossibility of promoting a popular insurrection with a coup d état impracticable and the impeachment of president nicolás maduro unworkable the men of the cia are trying to exhaust and delegitimize the bolivarian government with cybernetic sabotage 9 the last chapter of the hybrid war invented by mike pompeo and donald trump notes

while we are a bottoms up fundamental research shop we attempt to occasionally address macro issues and concerns we will avoid social and certain political matters our goal is an attempt to provide some insights into our unique investing philosophy strategy and process as always we will sprinkle in our own opinions and thoughts as we weave in our distinctive approach to investing in the fintech space in addition to highlighting some key macro thoughts we wanted to provide some thoughts on the capital markets especially the re opening of the ipo window first quarter 2019 performance the last time we published quarterly commentary on seeking alpha 1q 19 investor newsletter in early january it seemed as if the market was in a full panic while there were numerous market concerns there always are including a government shutdown we titled our note we apologize for being optimistic our successful start to 2019 is partially due to our long term approach as business buyers and not because we are short term traders or momentum chasers as the v shaped chart shows the first quarter of 2019 turned out to be the polar opposite of the fourth quarter of 2018 the nasdaq composite which fell over 20 from its record high set the second fastest recovery from a bear market in only 31 days in terms of equities the s p 500 is up an impressive 13 1 this year this is the best start to a year since 1998 before we get too carried away the market was up 12 in the first quarter of 2012 but then fell 3 3 the next quarter all 11 sectors of the s p 500 were higher last quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2014 technology led the charge up 19 4 the reit and industrials sectors were both quite strong up 16 6 during the quarter financials up 7 9 and healthcare up 6 1 were the two sector laggards but were still positive other global indexes were higher too with the shanghai composite up 23 9 the euro stoxx up 11 7 and brazil s sao paulo bovespa up 8 6 10 years later march 9th 2009 is often considered the peak of the financial crisis and the start of this historic us equity bull run a decade later the us market has rebounded handsomely us companies are performing well have strong balance sheets and our well capitalized banks are the envy of the world as this chart shows the us remains the best house on a crappy street many other markets from europe to japan to various emerging markets are barely higher than they were 10 and even 20 years ago for many reasons we are very thankful for living in the united states of america upcoming earnings over the next 4 to 6 weeks we will begin to get the first quarter 2019 results with the anniversary of the tax law changes earnings growth will be difficult for many companies to show over the last year many low or no growth companies were able to boost earnings with lower corporate tax rates and aggressive stock buybacks as warren buffett likes to say only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked without the benefit of lower corporate taxes companies will need to generate solid revenue growth to grow their bottom lines earnings growth is expected to materially fall off from recent years factset s first quarter estimates for s p 500 earnings is expecting a year over year drop of 4 for 2019 the s p 500 is expected to generate revenue growth of only 3 9 we constantly focus on companies that can organically grow we believe the market will soon begin to identify and reward those companies with secular growth as well as defensible and sustainable business models our portfolio of excellent fintech companies should more than double maybe triple the growth of the overall market the macro one of the key tenants of our investment philosophy is to always look forward we strive at all costs to anticipate the future ideally we never want to be reactionary just recently we received an interesting list from jefferies that enumerated a dozen items that the market is currently wrestling with their list is not all inclusive and not in any particular order but we do find these extremes and polar opposites to be fascinating hard brexit or reverse brexit interest rate increases or decreases red hot economy or recession socialism or hard right sky high energy prices or collapsing oil re elect or impeach amazon amzn please come or stay out of our city wall or no wall revolutionary tech co s or break them up open borders or closed borders nationalism or joint cooperation tariffs or free trade we will attempt to weave a few of these market concerns into our commentary but we do not have a magic 8 ball rest assured we will stay out of the political realm you do not need manole capital to discuss our personal political opinions we live in a world filled with passionate extremes tv talking heads where 280 characters in a tweet help state opinions as fact that s not us we will bore you with economic insights over 10 pagesâ in our complex and complicated world there unfortunately is no 100 right we attempt to make wonderful investing decisions based upon nuance compromise details estimates and trade offs manole capital is a bottoms up fundamental research company we focus our attention on investing in fintech companies that meet our ideal characteristics see here to allow the macro to impact our process would be foolish but so too would it be to ignore larger global issues the world is filled with individuals with diametrically opposed views screaming at each other on tv while some find watching this compelling our newsletters try to take a different tact we attempt to kiss or keep it simple stupid the fed back in october of 2018 federal reserve i e the fed chairman jerome powell stated that interest rates were a long way from neutral just a few quarters ago the fed was worried about the us economy overheating the market heeded the fed s guidance and began to model in multiple interest rate increases in 2019 and additional hikes in 2020 the s p 500 had an awful fourth quarter of 2018 and fell over 9 in december alone barely a year into his chairmanship of the fed chairman powell was receiving harsh criticism from all directions not only was president trump blaming him for the stock market fall but others were quick to point out numerous fed mistakes stephen moore who president trump just nominated to take a seat on the fed s board called chairman powell incompetent and for him to resign remind us again why people want these jobs the pivot last month in dramatic fashion at least as dramatic as economic decisions from a central banks can be the fed maintained fed funds at a target range of 2 25 and 2 50 the market immediately began to forecast that interest rates would be paused in addition starting in may of 2019 the fed announced that it would slow the pace of its sizeable balance sheet shrinkage we will show significant restraint and refrain from inserting a seinfeld s george costanza shrinkage joke was the fed responding to an awful stock market decline was the fed reacting to strong and negative commentary coming from president trump was the fed changing its stance because of slowing global growth did the chinese trade war impact fed thinking were elevated market volatility and uncertainty the cause for the abrupt change there is no right answer to any of these questions in our opinion the fed was demonstrating one of the fundamental characteristics that also impacts our investing process if the world turns out differently than you thinkâ pivot nobody is perfect there is no reason to remain tied to a losing investment we make mistakes all the time but the bigger problem is remaining dogmatic to that prior decision if things change we are not afraid to change with them we invest and we adapt in our opinion that s what chairman powell just did and we applaud the fed s decision cut the fed some slack last year the fed made some assumptions about how the economy was operating and felt it was appropriate to raise interest rates as new data arrived the fed updated its thinking estimates and models new assumptions were made and the fed paused additional interest rate hikes unfortunately the fed s actions and commentary last month were clearly a reaction to the market instead of anticipating the future the fed was responding to the news the fed used its data dependency stance to remove the two planned interest rate hikes from its 2019 forecast our world seems focused on proclaiming winners and losers some might prefer to declare that they got december right and that the fed got it wrong this misses the mark policy makers face tremendous uncertainty and there are trillions of dollars at stake with each of their decisions we think chairman powell and the fed are doing a good job of navigating these uncertain waters we are in one of the longest bull markets in us history and the fed has steadily increased interest rates over the last 3 years from near zero interest rates a decade ago we believe current economic conditions are positive we think the vast majority of stimulative measures should continue to be steadily removed if the financial crisis required the fed to put the us economy on life support in 2008 we believe it is ok to check the patient out of the hospital in 2019 the dual mandate the fed has 2 key components to their dual mandate they must strive for full employment and the fed targets a 2 inflation rate unemployment has steadily fallen and now sits at a nearly 50 year low output and wage growth have been accelerating and inflation finally approached the fed s magic 2 target while it did not stay there it has been a remarkably difficult target to reach for the last decade the fed has been struggling with the second component of its mandate its 2 inflation target it does seem that the tight relationship between wage growth and inflation has somewhat disappeared in prior cycles a tight labor market fueled higher wage growth which then spurred on inflationary worries with inflation staying stubbornly low the fed just stated that additional interest rate increases would not be forthcoming chairman powell stated it may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy in addition he said i don t see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint as the chart and research from pantheon macroeconomics shows wage inflation has been an excellent indicator and key driver of monetary policy it is clearly a positive to see hourly earnings climb higher with essentially full employment coupled with strong wage gains we believe the outlook for the us consumer remains stellar with gdp zigging and zagging from quarter to quarter it might take longer to get a real sense of underlying fundamentals it appears that the steady drumbeat of 25 basis point interest rate increases is on pause at least for the foreseeable future with the fed out of the picture and continued strength in the us economy we expect this to benefit equity investors interest rates using our favorite interest rate gauge the cme rate watch tool click here we can see that the futures market is now indicating a 30 chance that the fed actually cuts short term rates in june with a probability of easing at nearly 60 at the september meeting the market has totally flip flopped on its expectations based upon fed commentary in late march white house economic advisor larry kudlow urged the fed to immediately cut interest rates by 50 basis points we have a tremendous amount of respect for mr kudlow but we couldn t disagree more the fed raised interest nine times since it began lifting rates from near zero in late 2015 we do not believe that the slightest downturn in the stock market requires immediate stimulus we applaud the fed for its interest rate increases which reflected a more normal economic environment as we look forward and anticipate we would rather the fed reassess its estimates pause any further increases and let more information come to market our preference would be to see several more months of economic data before materially moving rates in either direction in our opinion the fed remains quite positive on the us economy it can be challenging to decipher some of their commentaries and read the tea leaves but we sense that chairman powell is trying to balance two important items he sees the us as the strongest economic engine on the planet with remarkably low unemployment and especially strong gdp growth countering this he sees a cloudy global environment chinese growth is slowing from its brisk pace brexit has been a mess for a couple of years in addition the rest of europe continues to struggle to generate even modest growth in fact the ecb continues to provide stimulus in the form of its controversial negative interest rate policy we still struggle with the concept of 11 trillion of european bonds that are guaranteeing the purchaser that he she will receive less in repayment and interest than they initially paid there will always be questions and uncertainty but we continue to see especially in the us the glass as more than half full the yield curve all economists believe the yield curve plays an important role in society short term interest rates should theoretically be below long term rates if investors are to be fairly compensated for taking additional duration risk in past cycles an inverted yield curve short term rates above long term rates has done a good job of predicting a recession we agree with dallas fed president robert kaplan who said i d need to see an inversion of some magnitude and or some duration and right now we don t have either however no prior cycle has ever had this much central bank involvement we believe there has to be some second derivative impact from the massive central bank stimuli and bond purchases the inversion as a positive just a few days after the yield curve inverted the shape became positive again does this mean that the looming recession has been called off certain economists have been calling for the end of this bull run for years now that we had a yield curve inversion these same pessimists are now calling for a sharp market decline would you rather be wrong one year and right ten or right one year and wrong ten we are not saying that an inversion is healthy or even positive we simply want to emphasize that we do not rush to decisions we analyze and study economic conditions every day a recession will eventually arrive in the us especially since we are a full decade from the financial crisis however we do not blindly follow economic rules and we do not believe that an inverted yield curve necessarily means a recession is imminent the fundamentals in the us are very strong in fact if we were to blindly follow rules we could easily make the point that an inverted yield curve is a positive why using history as our guide one could conclude that yield curve inversions are a positive for the stock market canaccord genuity research studied the last seven economic cycles and found that the s p 500 posted gains averaging 21 from the day of the inversion to the peak of that cycle over the last three cycles the market gained an average of 33 post inversion and the recession did not appear until 26 months later see below inversion recession months gain 12 14 88 07 31 90 19 34 05 26 98 03 31 01 34 40 12 27 05 12 31 07 24 25 average 26 33 tax reform the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act is barely a year old many pundits claimed that this would create a sugar high and fail to deliver on its promise of consistent and sustainable growth these are the same individuals that are arguing that the us is headed for a sharp economic decline we wonder if these are the arguments of sound economic analysis or rather potentially based on biased political and ideological wishful thinking last year the us enjoyed its fastest rate of growth since 2005 personal income growth of 4 5 was impressive but the second half of the year was even better at 5 7 both consumer and business confidence remain strong and do not indicate we are teetering on the edge of a recession at the end of last year the 12 month inflation rate using the fed s favorite gauge of pce or personal consumption expenditure price index was a manageable 1 75 inflationary pressures continued to decrease from 2 25 in the second quarter to 2 0 at the end of the third quarter this decline helps prove the point that the tax law has not just created a sugar high as supply side benefits were offset by inflationary demand increases the commerce department just reported that real gdp grew by 3 1 from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 which was the largest increase in 13 years just last month the congressional budget office or cbo reported that it needed to lower the projected cost of the tax reform package as the surge in economic growth will help offset some of the lost revenue these same critics point to a global economic slowdown but this misses the point the us has the fastest growth rate among the group of 7 countries alphabetical order of canada france germany italy japan the uk and the us the old tax code disincentivized us companies from investing at home which unfortunately moved some jobs intellectual property and manufacturing overseas as the chart shows the tax reform package at least made the us more competitive versus other developed countries could some of our best in class growth be attributable to lower corporate taxes is the us now becoming the best place in the developed world to invest we certainly hope so the following chart from ts lombard shows how the us industrial engine continues to outperform the other 34 countries in the oecd organization for economic co operation and development in fact current us relative outperformance has not been this strong in over 20 years with employment strong and the economy and stock market steadily marching higher consumers should continue to spend in our opinion the tax cuts should be applauded for helping sustain a us economic takeoff capital markets ipos the proverbial window for ipos seems to be opening up again over the last decade there has only been modest interest in becoming a publicly traded company one factor driving this stay private for longer trend is funding private equity and venture capital firms are flush with cash and can adequately fund these start ups another aspect driving this trend is intense regulation and compliance requirements private companies simply do not have the same burdens oversight and intense scrutiny that their public peers do private companies argue that they funded by visionary entrepreneurs building businesses for the future in addition these private companies claim public companies are shortsighted and become driven by quarterly targets and earnings expectations john tuttle head of global listings at the nyse recently said when we think about why companies go public they do it for liquidity to raise their profile and for capital but for those companies that are well capitalized all they really need is liquidity we like to define the job of a stock market as matching companies that need capital with investors who have the capital to invest only three years after jeff bezos founded amazon in his garage it went public in early 1997 investors had the opportunity to purchase amazon for a valuation of roughly 400 million fast forward 22 years and amazon has a market capitalization of nearly 900 billion and jeff bezos is the world s richest man charts like this show the enormous payoff of investing a mere 100 in certain ipos on day 1 while the payoff is attractive for this select group of businesses there unfortunately is a much longer list of ipos that massively failed it is this lottery ticket and short term mentality that we tend to shy away from professor jay ritter of the university of florida has studied ipos and his research is quite interesting the average first day gain for ipos is in the 15 to 20 range then over the subsequent 3 year period these ipo s tend to significantly underperform the broader market by nearly 20 professor ritter tracked the 856 ipo s that occurred between 1999 and 2000 257 of these deals or 30 of these ipo s lost more than 90 of their value after only five years in our opinion this screams of short termism it shouts to be cautious and prudent when investing in ipos unicorns the list of unicorns or private companies with valuations over 1 billion is fairly lengthy with the stock market down 4 4 last year many private companies decided not to pursue an ipo the year to date turnaround has whetted the appetite for some of these private companies to go public 2019 is shaping up to potentially be one of the best ipo years in decades just a few weeks ago lyft lyft the ride hailing company had its ipo following lyft the market is expecting its peer uber uber to come public the ipo pipeline also has data mining company palantir palan chat software provider slack image startup pinterest pins and home rental firm airbnb airb with a stampede of technology unicorns coming investors should be careful many of these companies are not profitable and have no immediate plans to be free cash flow positive venture capital investors are willing to bypass profits for heightened growth with the intention of selling their stake upon an ipo when the stock market is rising investors sometimes ignore the worrying signs of large free cash flow burn if we see a market turnaround some of these unprofitable and newly ipod companies will have some explaining to do our guess is that many of their new shareholders will quickly sell instead of investing for the long term after strong interest lyft closed 9 higher on its first day the company raised 2 34 billion and had an implied market capitalization of 26 5 billion after the retail euphoria and fever broke the share price quickly fell below the initial listing price our personal favorite sell side note on lyft was issued by seaport global it launched coverage of lyft with a sell rating and a 42 price target which down over 40 from its ipo price their biggest concern was valuation which we personally chuckled at as lyft will only lose a billion dollars this year lyft is not the only unicorn coming to market that has a murky path to profitability don t get our point wrong we are not implying that lyft or uber or any of these unicorns are shorts to the contrary we have found that shorting companies that dominate an attractive trend simply because they are currently unprofitable is not a great investment decision goldman sachs estimates that the ride hailing industry has the opportunity to become a nearly 300 billion industry in a decade we do not know if lyft or uber will dominate this industry but they certainly are positioned well going forward time will tell if lyft or uber or other unicorns make solid investments all we are trying to emphasize is that investors should do significant research and analysis before buying into these new companies we certainly are sharpening our pencils another unicorn slack is a workplace messaging platform with a private market value of about 7 billion slack is so well funded that it will not be doing a traditional ipo instead slack will directly list itself on the nyse direct listing is what spotify spot chose to do when it went public last year instead of following the normal underwriting process utilizing expensive wall street brokers to line up institutional investors and raising money direct listing simply picks an exchange and becomes a publicly traded entity this route is cheaper but does have the risk of higher volatility we see some similarity to the environment of 1999 and 2000 during the dot com era companies were being valued not on revenue or profits but on internet page views at the height of the period in 1999 hundreds of companies were racing to go public dealogic reported that these companies raised a record 108 billion these companies made a madcap dash to the public markets and were welcomed by hordes of retail investors who thought they could day trade their way to vast fortunes pets com and their famous puppet sock went public at 11 per share in february of 2000 only a year after it was founded the puppet sock became so popular it made an appearance on good morning america had a float in the macy s thanksgiving day parade got a super bowl commercial in 2000 as well as a prized interview with people magazine just nine months later pet com was out of business and it never rose above its initial listing price with the ability to both purchase and short stocks we look forward to seeing more interesting companies become publicly traded entities is it ideal or wise to be purchasing new listings in a company that silicon valley vcs have just decided to part ways with in addition is it a great investment decision to give these newly minted billionaires special shares with extra voting power many of these money losing companies are using price to revenue or sales multiples back in 1998 to 2000 the price to sales multiple sometimes reached 30x both lyft and uber are coming to market with price to sales multiples in the 10x range in the meantime while the ipo is wide open these companies should strike while the iron is hot one never knows when it will slam shut conclusion the nearly 20 late last year has roughly been recovered year to date the worries that existed in 2018 have not been resolved in fact the world remains full of skepticism and uncertainty see page 3 as we know the only certainty in the future is additional uncertainty some investors panicked during the fourth quarter decline and went to cash did these investors return to the equity market and benefit from the rebound and upswing unfortunately for them we doubt it we can t believe it we made it all the way through a newsletter and barely commented on the us vs china trade war let s just say that the stock market remains fairly optimistic that a us china trade deal is imminent president trump after meeting with chinese vice premier liu he at the white house said that a deal is still a few weeks away he did emphasize that both sides were making progress and that an agreement would be very monumental even if the deal is just plain ol monumental we would anticipate its resolution will send stocks higher we are not contrarians sector rotators momentum chasers or even market timers there will always be temporary periods of weakness but we are confident that our concentrated portfolio of fintech companies will perform well in both up and down markets we remain committed to investing in companies that generate recurring revenue predictable cash flow and have sustainable business models we are optimistic on the us equity markets and believe the economic environment is poised to continue to trend higher with the recent fed pivot reasonable stock valuations and a positive global environment we remain bullish warren fisher cfa founder ceo manole capital management
france italy and spain apparently have nothing to say about germany s refusal to support the euro area economy with looser fiscal policies and decreases in its growth stifling trade surpluses washington also keeps silent as germany endangers a quarter of its exports to europe while pocketing a 70 billion surplus on its u s goods trade the european central bank is entirely carrying the burden of the euro area economic stabilization eleven years after the onset of the epochal financial crisis followed by the great recession the european central bank is still trying to hold the monetary union from drowning in another cycle of rising unemployment poverty and civil unrest those rushing to ascribe that to the lack of instruments for economic policy coordination are wrong advertisement advertisement the euro area has a de facto economic government in the form of the eurogroup a forum of finance ministers for eight years until october 2017 the group was chaired by wolfgang schäuble germany former finance minister who oversaw the greece debacle and the long years of fiscal austerity in recession ridden euro area economies under german leadership slashing the government spending became the order of the day eventually that calamity morphed into a cruel joke known as the austerity growth model a sharp contraction of public sector expenditures and a regime of liberal hiring and firing sold to true believers as structural labor market reforms france has been under relentless german pressures to apply that oxymoronic growth model paris duly followed with some fiscal austerity and a lot of harsh labor market deregulations combined most recently with ill fated gasoline taxes the eu must change advertisement advertisement now all france has to show for that is a civil unrest five months of continuing and violent demonstrations a rush to douse the fires with increased public spending and a hasty recall of gasoline taxes that s an estimated 10 billion euro cost to the public treasury with disruptions to economic activity higher budget deficits and question marks about the country s business and investment environment story continues italy is another example to get back at a newly elected europhobic italian government last year the eu commission opposed an eminently reasonable and mildly reflationary fiscal package proposed by rome under threats of sanctions and other reprimands from the commission italy was forced to scale back its public spending and cut the budget deficit down predictably an already weak italian economy promptly sank into a deepening recession during the second half of last year but oblivious to the logical outcome of the imposed fiscal austerity the eu commission is now warning the italian government that the sinking economic growth would lead to overshooting the budget deficit target decreed by the commission itself that s an intolerably absurd situation the lunacy however could go further one might soon see the commission s orders cut deeper into the public spending of italy s declining economy adding spain and portugal to france and italy one gets exactly half of the euro area where demand management is crippled by binding fiscal constraints that group s budget deficits are in the range of 1 5 to 3 5 percent of gdp and their gross public debt goes from 115 percent of gdp to 153 percent of gdp advertisement advertisement surplus countries should be growth leaders each of those countries are currently experiencing a slowing demand output and employment and all of them need strong support to economic activity where can that come from excluding the fiscal policy there are only two sources low credit costs and rising export sales the ecb is doing all it can with abundant credit flows and a zero percent interest rate to the horror of its german critics but acting alone the monetary policy cannot do it all bank lending to households is stuck at modest annual growth rates of 3 percent to 3 5 percent such a subdued demand for money is partly a result of high unemployment in spain 13 9 percent italy 10 7 percent france 8 8 percent and portugal 6 3 percent and the lingering uncertainties about the extent and duration of the growth slowdown and dimming prospects for job creation advertisement advertisement the upshot is that volumes of retail trade in the three months to february showed no monthly growth in france spain and portugal that s a bad omen for household consumption the pillar of economic activity in the interest rate sensitive segment of aggregate demand exports could help but that would require that the other half of the monetary union with budget and trade surpluses steps up public spending and tax cuts to stimulate domestic demand that would expand export markets within the euro area and beyond where hard pressed deficit countries could sell some of their goods and services but germany has ruled that out anticipating calls for looser fiscal policies and a decreased reliance on its mercantilist policies germany served notice that it would continue to run budget surpluses and that u s president donald trump should be told that german trade surpluses are just the way it is washington of course should not take that because it violates the letter and the spirit of the g 7 and g 20 policy recommendations on top of that germany s refusal to support the euro area growth puts in danger a quarter of u s exports to europe while berlin pockets 70 billion on its u s goods trade advertisement advertisement the international monetary fund and the organization for economic cooperation and development should also stop whining about the weakening world economy and call out naming names the trade and budget surplus countries to exercise an effective policy coordination investment thoughts with germany refusing to budge from its budget surpluses and to stop syphoning out 160 billion euro of purchasing power from its eu trade partners the ecb is left to pick up the pieces in a policy mix that keeps fiscal policy as a virtually frozen instrument of demand management it s a sad european spectacle where tongue tied france italy and spain are accepting the brunt of totally uncooperative german economic policies they don t hesitate to pour scorn on the trump administration but they keep looking up to washington to get germany off their backs advertisement advertisement their main ally however is the ecb because its monetary policy carries the entire burden of economic stabilization in a highly integrated free trading area representing about one fifth of the world economy all that could radically change though next november the ecb may well get a new boss who after a calamitous fiscal austerity seems set to teach a lesson about unyielding hard money policies commentary by michael ivanovitch an independent analyst focusing on world economy geopolitics and investment strategy he served as a senior economist at the

while we are a bottoms up fundamental research shop we attempt to occasionally address macro issues and concerns we will avoid social and certain political matters our goal is an attempt to provide some insights into our unique investing philosophy strategy and process as always we will sprinkle in our own opinions and thoughts as we weave in our distinctive approach to investing in the fintech space in addition to highlighting some key macro thoughts we wanted to provide some thoughts on the capital markets especially the re opening of the ipo window first quarter 2019 performance the last time we published quarterly commentary on seeking alpha 1q 19 investor newsletter in early january it seemed as if the market was in a full panic while there were numerous market concerns there always are including a government shutdown we titled our note we apologize for being optimistic our successful start to 2019 is partially due to our long term approach as business buyers and not because we are short term traders or momentum chasers as the v shaped chart shows the first quarter of 2019 turned out to be the polar opposite of the fourth quarter of 2018 the nasdaq composite which fell over 20 from its record high set the second fastest recovery from a bear market in only 31 days in terms of equities the s p 500 is up an impressive 13 1 this year this is the best start to a year since 1998 before we get too carried away the market was up 12 in the first quarter of 2012 but then fell 3 3 the next quarter all 11 sectors of the s p 500 were higher last quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2014 technology led the charge up 19 4 the reit and industrials sectors were both quite strong up 16 6 during the quarter financials up 7 9 and healthcare up 6 1 were the two sector laggards but were still positive other global indexes were higher too with the shanghai composite up 23 9 the euro stoxx up 11 7 and brazil s sao paulo bovespa up 8 6 10 years later march 9th 2009 is often considered the peak of the financial crisis and the start of this historic us equity bull run a decade later the us market has rebounded handsomely us companies are performing well have strong balance sheets and our well capitalized banks are the envy of the world as this chart shows the us remains the best house on a crappy street many other markets from europe to japan to various emerging markets are barely higher than they were 10 and even 20 years ago for many reasons we are very thankful for living in the united states of america upcoming earnings over the next 4 to 6 weeks we will begin to get the first quarter 2019 results with the anniversary of the tax law changes earnings growth will be difficult for many companies to show over the last year many low or no growth companies were able to boost earnings with lower corporate tax rates and aggressive stock buybacks as warren buffett likes to say only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked without the benefit of lower corporate taxes companies will need to generate solid revenue growth to grow their bottom lines earnings growth is expected to materially fall off from recent years factset s first quarter estimates for s p 500 earnings is expecting a year over year drop of 4 for 2019 the s p 500 is expected to generate revenue growth of only 3 9 we constantly focus on companies that can organically grow we believe the market will soon begin to identify and reward those companies with secular growth as well as defensible and sustainable business models our portfolio of excellent fintech companies should more than double maybe triple the growth of the overall market the macro one of the key tenants of our investment philosophy is to always look forward we strive at all costs to anticipate the future ideally we never want to be reactionary just recently we received an interesting list from jefferies that enumerated a dozen items that the market is currently wrestling with their list is not all inclusive and not in any particular order but we do find these extremes and polar opposites to be fascinating hard brexit or reverse brexit interest rate increases or decreases red hot economy or recession socialism or hard right sky high energy prices or collapsing oil re elect or impeach amazon amzn please come or stay out of our city wall or no wall revolutionary tech co s or break them up open borders or closed borders nationalism or joint cooperation tariffs or free trade we will attempt to weave a few of these market concerns into our commentary but we do not have a magic 8 ball rest assured we will stay out of the political realm you do not need manole capital to discuss our personal political opinions we live in a world filled with passionate extremes tv talking heads where 280 characters in a tweet help state opinions as fact that s not us we will bore you with economic insights over 10 pagesâ in our complex and complicated world there unfortunately is no 100 right we attempt to make wonderful investing decisions based upon nuance compromise details estimates and trade offs manole capital is a bottoms up fundamental research company we focus our attention on investing in fintech companies that meet our ideal characteristics see here to allow the macro to impact our process would be foolish but so too would it be to ignore larger global issues the world is filled with individuals with diametrically opposed views screaming at each other on tv while some find watching this compelling our newsletters try to take a different tact we attempt to kiss or keep it simple stupid the fed back in october of 2018 federal reserve i e the fed chairman jerome powell stated that interest rates were a long way from neutral just a few quarters ago the fed was worried about the us economy overheating the market heeded the fed s guidance and began to model in multiple interest rate increases in 2019 and additional hikes in 2020 the s p 500 had an awful fourth quarter of 2018 and fell over 9 in december alone barely a year into his chairmanship of the fed chairman powell was receiving harsh criticism from all directions not only was president trump blaming him for the stock market fall but others were quick to point out numerous fed mistakes stephen moore who president trump just nominated to take a seat on the fed s board called chairman powell incompetent and for him to resign remind us again why people want these jobs the pivot last month in dramatic fashion at least as dramatic as economic decisions from a central banks can be the fed maintained fed funds at a target range of 2 25 and 2 50 the market immediately began to forecast that interest rates would be paused in addition starting in may of 2019 the fed announced that it would slow the pace of its sizeable balance sheet shrinkage we will show significant restraint and refrain from inserting a seinfeld s george costanza shrinkage joke was the fed responding to an awful stock market decline was the fed reacting to strong and negative commentary coming from president trump was the fed changing its stance because of slowing global growth did the chinese trade war impact fed thinking were elevated market volatility and uncertainty the cause for the abrupt change there is no right answer to any of these questions in our opinion the fed was demonstrating one of the fundamental characteristics that also impacts our investing process if the world turns out differently than you thinkâ pivot nobody is perfect there is no reason to remain tied to a losing investment we make mistakes all the time but the bigger problem is remaining dogmatic to that prior decision if things change we are not afraid to change with them we invest and we adapt in our opinion that s what chairman powell just did and we applaud the fed s decision cut the fed some slack last year the fed made some assumptions about how the economy was operating and felt it was appropriate to raise interest rates as new data arrived the fed updated its thinking estimates and models new assumptions were made and the fed paused additional interest rate hikes unfortunately the fed s actions and commentary last month were clearly a reaction to the market instead of anticipating the future the fed was responding to the news the fed used its data dependency stance to remove the two planned interest rate hikes from its 2019 forecast our world seems focused on proclaiming winners and losers some might prefer to declare that they got december right and that the fed got it wrong this misses the mark policy makers face tremendous uncertainty and there are trillions of dollars at stake with each of their decisions we think chairman powell and the fed are doing a good job of navigating these uncertain waters we are in one of the longest bull markets in us history and the fed has steadily increased interest rates over the last 3 years from near zero interest rates a decade ago we believe current economic conditions are positive we think the vast majority of stimulative measures should continue to be steadily removed if the financial crisis required the fed to put the us economy on life support in 2008 we believe it is ok to check the patient out of the hospital in 2019 the dual mandate the fed has 2 key components to their dual mandate they must strive for full employment and the fed targets a 2 inflation rate unemployment has steadily fallen and now sits at a nearly 50 year low output and wage growth have been accelerating and inflation finally approached the fed s magic 2 target while it did not stay there it has been a remarkably difficult target to reach for the last decade the fed has been struggling with the second component of its mandate its 2 inflation target it does seem that the tight relationship between wage growth and inflation has somewhat disappeared in prior cycles a tight labor market fueled higher wage growth which then spurred on inflationary worries with inflation staying stubbornly low the fed just stated that additional interest rate increases would not be forthcoming chairman powell stated it may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy in addition he said i don t see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint as the chart and research from pantheon macroeconomics shows wage inflation has been an excellent indicator and key driver of monetary policy it is clearly a positive to see hourly earnings climb higher with essentially full employment coupled with strong wage gains we believe the outlook for the us consumer remains stellar with gdp zigging and zagging from quarter to quarter it might take longer to get a real sense of underlying fundamentals it appears that the steady drumbeat of 25 basis point interest rate increases is on pause at least for the foreseeable future with the fed out of the picture and continued strength in the us economy we expect this to benefit equity investors interest rates using our favorite interest rate gauge the cme rate watch tool click here we can see that the futures market is now indicating a 30 chance that the fed actually cuts short term rates in june with a probability of easing at nearly 60 at the september meeting the market has totally flip flopped on its expectations based upon fed commentary in late march white house economic advisor larry kudlow urged the fed to immediately cut interest rates by 50 basis points we have a tremendous amount of respect for mr kudlow but we couldn t disagree more the fed raised interest nine times since it began lifting rates from near zero in late 2015 we do not believe that the slightest downturn in the stock market requires immediate stimulus we applaud the fed for its interest rate increases which reflected a more normal economic environment as we look forward and anticipate we would rather the fed reassess its estimates pause any further increases and let more information come to market our preference would be to see several more months of economic data before materially moving rates in either direction in our opinion the fed remains quite positive on the us economy it can be challenging to decipher some of their commentaries and read the tea leaves but we sense that chairman powell is trying to balance two important items he sees the us as the strongest economic engine on the planet with remarkably low unemployment and especially strong gdp growth countering this he sees a cloudy global environment chinese growth is slowing from its brisk pace brexit has been a mess for a couple of years in addition the rest of europe continues to struggle to generate even modest growth in fact the ecb continues to provide stimulus in the form of its controversial negative interest rate policy we still struggle with the concept of 11 trillion of european bonds that are guaranteeing the purchaser that he she will receive less in repayment and interest than they initially paid there will always be questions and uncertainty but we continue to see especially in the us the glass as more than half full the yield curve all economists believe the yield curve plays an important role in society short term interest rates should theoretically be below long term rates if investors are to be fairly compensated for taking additional duration risk in past cycles an inverted yield curve short term rates above long term rates has done a good job of predicting a recession we agree with dallas fed president robert kaplan who said i d need to see an inversion of some magnitude and or some duration and right now we don t have either however no prior cycle has ever had this much central bank involvement we believe there has to be some second derivative impact from the massive central bank stimuli and bond purchases the inversion as a positive just a few days after the yield curve inverted the shape became positive again does this mean that the looming recession has been called off certain economists have been calling for the end of this bull run for years now that we had a yield curve inversion these same pessimists are now calling for a sharp market decline would you rather be wrong one year and right ten or right one year and wrong ten we are not saying that an inversion is healthy or even positive we simply want to emphasize that we do not rush to decisions we analyze and study economic conditions every day a recession will eventually arrive in the us especially since we are a full decade from the financial crisis however we do not blindly follow economic rules and we do not believe that an inverted yield curve necessarily means a recession is imminent the fundamentals in the us are very strong in fact if we were to blindly follow rules we could easily make the point that an inverted yield curve is a positive why using history as our guide one could conclude that yield curve inversions are a positive for the stock market canaccord genuity research studied the last seven economic cycles and found that the s p 500 posted gains averaging 21 from the day of the inversion to the peak of that cycle over the last three cycles the market gained an average of 33 post inversion and the recession did not appear until 26 months later see below inversion recession months gain 12 14 88 07 31 90 19 34 05 26 98 03 31 01 34 40 12 27 05 12 31 07 24 25 average 26 33 tax reform the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act is barely a year old many pundits claimed that this would create a sugar high and fail to deliver on its promise of consistent and sustainable growth these are the same individuals that are arguing that the us is headed for a sharp economic decline we wonder if these are the arguments of sound economic analysis or rather potentially based on biased political and ideological wishful thinking last year the us enjoyed its fastest rate of growth since 2005 personal income growth of 4 5 was impressive but the second half of the year was even better at 5 7 both consumer and business confidence remain strong and do not indicate we are teetering on the edge of a recession at the end of last year the 12 month inflation rate using the fed s favorite gauge of pce or personal consumption expenditure price index was a manageable 1 75 inflationary pressures continued to decrease from 2 25 in the second quarter to 2 0 at the end of the third quarter this decline helps prove the point that the tax law has not just created a sugar high as supply side benefits were offset by inflationary demand increases the commerce department just reported that real gdp grew by 3 1 from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018 which was the largest increase in 13 years just last month the congressional budget office or cbo reported that it needed to lower the projected cost of the tax reform package as the surge in economic growth will help offset some of the lost revenue these same critics point to a global economic slowdown but this misses the point the us has the fastest growth rate among the group of 7 countries alphabetical order of canada france germany italy japan the uk and the us the old tax code disincentivized us companies from investing at home which unfortunately moved some jobs intellectual property and manufacturing overseas as the chart shows the tax reform package at least made the us more competitive versus other developed countries could some of our best in class growth be attributable to lower corporate taxes is the us now becoming the best place in the developed world to invest we certainly hope so the following chart from ts lombard shows how the us industrial engine continues to outperform the other 34 countries in the oecd organization for economic co operation and development in fact current us relative outperformance has not been this strong in over 20 years with employment strong and the economy and stock market steadily marching higher consumers should continue to spend in our opinion the tax cuts should be applauded for helping sustain a us economic takeoff capital markets ipos the proverbial window for ipos seems to be opening up again over the last decade there has only been modest interest in becoming a publicly traded company one factor driving this stay private for longer trend is funding private equity and venture capital firms are flush with cash and can adequately fund these start ups another aspect driving this trend is intense regulation and compliance requirements private companies simply do not have the same burdens oversight and intense scrutiny that their public peers do private companies argue that they funded by visionary entrepreneurs building businesses for the future in addition these private companies claim public companies are shortsighted and become driven by quarterly targets and earnings expectations john tuttle head of global listings at the nyse recently said when we think about why companies go public they do it for liquidity to raise their profile and for capital but for those companies that are well capitalized all they really need is liquidity we like to define the job of a stock market as matching companies that need capital with investors who have the capital to invest only three years after jeff bezos founded amazon in his garage it went public in early 1997 investors had the opportunity to purchase amazon for a valuation of roughly 400 million fast forward 22 years and amazon has a market capitalization of nearly 900 billion and jeff bezos is the world s richest man charts like this show the enormous payoff of investing a mere 100 in certain ipos on day 1 while the payoff is attractive for this select group of businesses there unfortunately is a much longer list of ipos that massively failed it is this lottery ticket and short term mentality that we tend to shy away from professor jay ritter of the university of florida has studied ipos and his research is quite interesting the average first day gain for ipos is in the 15 to 20 range then over the subsequent 3 year period these ipo s tend to significantly underperform the broader market by nearly 20 professor ritter tracked the 856 ipo s that occurred between 1999 and 2000 257 of these deals or 30 of these ipo s lost more than 90 of their value after only five years in our opinion this screams of short termism it shouts to be cautious and prudent when investing in ipos unicorns the list of unicorns or private companies with valuations over 1 billion is fairly lengthy with the stock market down 4 4 last year many private companies decided not to pursue an ipo the year to date turnaround has whetted the appetite for some of these private companies to go public 2019 is shaping up to potentially be one of the best ipo years in decades just a few weeks ago lyft lyft the ride hailing company had its ipo following lyft the market is expecting its peer uber uber to come public the ipo pipeline also has data mining company palantir palan chat software provider slack image startup pinterest pins and home rental firm airbnb airb with a stampede of technology unicorns coming investors should be careful many of these companies are not profitable and have no immediate plans to be free cash flow positive venture capital investors are willing to bypass profits for heightened growth with the intention of selling their stake upon an ipo when the stock market is rising investors sometimes ignore the worrying signs of large free cash flow burn if we see a market turnaround some of these unprofitable and newly ipod companies will have some explaining to do our guess is that many of their new shareholders will quickly sell instead of investing for the long term after strong interest lyft closed 9 higher on its first day the company raised 2 34 billion and had an implied market capitalization of 26 5 billion after the retail euphoria and fever broke the share price quickly fell below the initial listing price our personal favorite sell side note on lyft was issued by seaport global it launched coverage of lyft with a sell rating and a 42 price target which down over 40 from its ipo price their biggest concern was valuation which we personally chuckled at as lyft will only lose a billion dollars this year lyft is not the only unicorn coming to market that has a murky path to profitability don t get our point wrong we are not implying that lyft or uber or any of these unicorns are shorts to the contrary we have found that shorting companies that dominate an attractive trend simply because they are currently unprofitable is not a great investment decision goldman sachs estimates that the ride hailing industry has the opportunity to become a nearly 300 billion industry in a decade we do not know if lyft or uber will dominate this industry but they certainly are positioned well going forward time will tell if lyft or uber or other unicorns make solid investments all we are trying to emphasize is that investors should do significant research and analysis before buying into these new companies we certainly are sharpening our pencils another unicorn slack is a workplace messaging platform with a private market value of about 7 billion slack is so well funded that it will not be doing a traditional ipo instead slack will directly list itself on the nyse direct listing is what spotify spot chose to do when it went public last year instead of following the normal underwriting process utilizing expensive wall street brokers to line up institutional investors and raising money direct listing simply picks an exchange and becomes a publicly traded entity this route is cheaper but does have the risk of higher volatility we see some similarity to the environment of 1999 and 2000 during the dot com era companies were being valued not on revenue or profits but on internet page views at the height of the period in 1999 hundreds of companies were racing to go public dealogic reported that these companies raised a record 108 billion these companies made a madcap dash to the public markets and were welcomed by hordes of retail investors who thought they could day trade their way to vast fortunes pets com and their famous puppet sock went public at 11 per share in february of 2000 only a year after it was founded the puppet sock became so popular it made an appearance on good morning america had a float in the macy s thanksgiving day parade got a super bowl commercial in 2000 as well as a prized interview with people magazine just nine months later pet com was out of business and it never rose above its initial listing price with the ability to both purchase and short stocks we look forward to seeing more interesting companies become publicly traded entities is it ideal or wise to be purchasing new listings in a company that silicon valley vcs have just decided to part ways with in addition is it a great investment decision to give these newly minted billionaires special shares with extra voting power many of these money losing companies are using price to revenue or sales multiples back in 1998 to 2000 the price to sales multiple sometimes reached 30x both lyft and uber are coming to market with price to sales multiples in the 10x range in the meantime while the ipo is wide open these companies should strike while the iron is hot one never knows when it will slam shut conclusion the nearly 20 late last year has roughly been recovered year to date the worries that existed in 2018 have not been resolved in fact the world remains full of skepticism and uncertainty see page 3 as we know the only certainty in the future is additional uncertainty some investors panicked during the fourth quarter decline and went to cash did these investors return to the equity market and benefit from the rebound and upswing unfortunately for them we doubt it we can t believe it we made it all the way through a newsletter and barely commented on the us vs china trade war let s just say that the stock market remains fairly optimistic that a us china trade deal is imminent president trump after meeting with chinese vice premier liu he at the white house said that a deal is still a few weeks away he did emphasize that both sides were making progress and that an agreement would be very monumental even if the deal is just plain ol monumental we would anticipate its resolution will send stocks higher we are not contrarians sector rotators momentum chasers or even market timers there will always be temporary periods of weakness but we are confident that our concentrated portfolio of fintech companies will perform well in both up and down markets we remain committed to investing in companies that generate recurring revenue predictable cash flow and have sustainable business models we are optimistic on the us equity markets and believe the economic environment is poised to continue to trend higher with the recent fed pivot reasonable stock valuations and a positive global environment we remain bullish warren fisher cfa founder ceo manole capital management
in this week s monday briefing mei experts alex vatanka emadeddin badi yousef munayyer randa slim and shahrokh fardoust provide analysis on recent and upcoming events including the irgc s designation as a terrorist group the battle for control of tripoli in libya the impact of israel s elections on the palestinian crisis iraqi pm abdul mahdi s first official visit to iran and the spring meetings of the world bank and imf in dc us irgc terrorist designation and the view from tehran alex vatanka senior fellow the decision by the trump administration to designate the islamic revolutionary guards corps irgc as a terrorist organization has predictably been met by official anger in tehran still underneath that veneer iranian officials clearly do not view this latest development as a precursor to a military conflict between iran and the u s the consensus in tehran is still that president donald trump has no desire to launch a new military conflict in the middle east but that he finds the designation of the irgc as part of his maximum pressure campaign against iran to come at little domestic or international political cost to him as he prepares to run for re election this does not mean tehran will not look for ways to shape trump s calculations however in a tweet foreign minister javad zarif warned that trump s netanyahufirster middle east policy as he put it might unintentionally drag the u s into another war this is a repeated iranian allegation that israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is the real driver behind the trump administration s middle east policies u s hostility toward the irgc and vice versa is nothing new and dozens of irgc affiliated organizations such as the al quds force companies and individuals were already on the u s sanctions list what remains to be seen is if the irgc s designation in its entirety will change the ground rules in the region where u s and irgc linked forces often operate in close vicinity to one another in places like iraq and syria does it now mean that the u s will kinetically target irgc linked assets the way it targets other u s designated terror groups such as al qaeda and isis that was not the case after al quds force was separately designated in 2007 perhaps the trump administration will go beyond mere designation this time around and if so it is hard to see how the irgc would not be forced to respond alexvatanka on the brink of a third civil war in libya emadeddin badi non resident scholar in early april libyan general khalifa hifter announced he was launching a military operation dubbed flood of dignity with the aim of liberating tripoli and cleansing it from terrorist groups and corruption although hifter had been hinting at a possible military takeover of the libyan capital for months the offensive s timing was particularly concerning it came during a scheduled visit to libya by un secretary general antonio guterres who flew to the country to meet key stakeholders including hifter ahead of the un led national conference in mid april the latter is now unlikely to be held especially since guterres himself was unable to dissuade hifter from moving against the capital since the launch of the offensive the g7 the un security council and the un support mission in libya have all issued subdued statements of concern that eschewed directly condemning hifter s self styled libyan national army lna only the united states took a firmer stance expressing its clear opposition to hifter s offensive on the ground the situation took an unexpected turn however hifter had gambled on repeating the strategy he used in his recent fezzan campaign advancing by co opting and striking alliances with local groups subsequently integrating them into the lna however he underestimated his ability to unite multiple western libyan factions against him moreover unlike in the south the lna was not advancing in a vacuum indeed military and paramilitary groups nominally under the un backed government of national accord mobilized to halt his advance toward tripoli brigades from the cities of misurata and zintan joined forces with tripoli s protection force united by the common threat of a hostile takeover by hifter with hifter intent on taking tripoli by force and armed western groups determined to counter him libya is on the brink of its third civil war in less than a decade emad_badi resolving the palestinian crisis is no longer even on the agenda yousef munayyer mei scholar the israeli state is about to hold another election for its government and in the territory under its control nearly 5 million people palestinians living in occupied territory have no right to vote for the government that ultimately rules their lives on an american scale this would be akin to the disenfranchisement of 120 million of the 330 million people living in the u s in most contexts this would be a massive political crisis as well as a human rights crisis and yet in israel resolving this crisis has essentially disappeared from the agendas of almost all parties when it comes to policy toward the palestinian people and the question of peace the main contest in the election today is between those who support annexation of parts or all of the west bank or perpetual occupation for palestinians both of these options amount to the same thing the continued denial of their basic rights u s policy has enabled the continued right ward drift of israeli politics by ensuring israel faces no consequences for violations of international law most recently the trump administration s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital and its recognition of the golan heights as israeli territory have reinforced the israeli understanding that if they lay claim to something washington will eventually back them this dynamic in u s israeli relations goes far beyond the trump administration the continued descent of israeli politics toward the racist extremism of the right wing has burnished an affinity with right wing leaders across the globe in a moment of rising populism and ethnic nationalism but it also puts the country on a collision course with actors internationally that value freedom justice and equality for more analysis of tomorrow s israeli elections please see our special briefing from thursday yousefmunayyer iraqi pm s visit to tehran highlights iran iraq ties randa slim senior fellow director of conflict resolution and track ii dialogues program this weekend iraqi prime minister adel abdul mahdi led a senior delegation of ministers and businessmen on his first official visit to tehran according to the prime minister s office the primary purpose of the trip is to follow up on the bilateral agreements signed last month during the iranian president s visit to iraq and to add more agreements to achieve more cooperation and convergence in the political economic and social fields iran s oil minister announced the two countries had reached a preliminary understanding to develop two oilfields on their mutual border last month iraq and iran agreed to abide by the terms of the 1975 algiers agreement on maritime and border demarcation between the two countries including the delimitations of the shatt al arab waterway a politically sensitive issue for iraq this agreement was viewed by many iraqis as favoring iran more than iraq this visit to tehran comes after abdul mahdi s arab tripartite summit in cairo with jordan s king abdullah ii and egyptian president abdel fattah el sissi it was also preceded by a meeting in baghdad of the second saudi iraqi coordination council which discussed the finalization of 13 agreements and memoranda of understanding between the two countries abdul mahdi is planning a mid april visit to saudi arabia and other neighboring arab countries while in tehran prime minister abdul mahdi received unsolicited advice from the iranian supreme leader ali khamenei about u s intentions in iraq and a request to make sure the americans withdraw their troops from iraq as soon as possible iran s supreme leader warned the visiting iraqi official about the u s and saudi arabia saying the rhetorical remarks of the americans and saudis about iraq contradict their intentions on the one hand the iranian supreme leader s comments will likely be viewed by a large spectrum of the iraqi public as interference in their country s domestic affairs and will make it even more difficult for parliament to pass a bill pushed by pro iranian factions calling for the expulsion of u s forces from iraq on the other hand khamenei s admonition might embolden these same pro iranian factions and make them less willing to compromise on appointments to the four vacant ministerial portfolios including defense and interior not only is increasing cooperation between iraq and iran raising suspicions about iraq s regional priorities among its arab gulf neighbors including saudi arabia and kuwait as well as turkey it might also become harder for iraq to go through with these agreements with tehran following the u s designation of the iranian revolutionary guards corps which controls significant segments of the iranian economy as a foreign terrorist organization still prime minister abdul mahdi cannot afford to antagonize iranian leaders given their political and economic clout in iraq rmslim world bank and imf spring meetings in washington shahrokh fardoust mei scholar the world bank and international monetary fund imf hold their spring meetings in washington dc this week at the meetings the governors of the 189 member countries normally finance or planning ministers for the bank and central bank governors for the imf meet to discuss global economic and financial

at the world bank and implementing the world bank group s recent capital increase both institutions are expected to hold briefing sessions for the visiting delegations and international press on the economic and financial situation in the middle east and north africa mena region and their respective programs the economic outlook for the mena region is mixed the recovery in oil prices last year provided some welcome relief but prices have fallen since then forcing the region s oil exporters to once again attempt to reduce the role of the state in the economy and their dependence on oil through diversification of their economies and exports countries have reduced public investment and politically sensitive subsidies and encouraged private financing particularly for infrastructure projects the forecast of weakening in average oil prices over the next two to three years will constrain the ability of governments to reverse their austerity drives although fear of provoking social unrest is likely to temper efforts to reduce spending and subsidies world bank economists expect economic growth in mena to continue at a modest annual pace of about 1 5 3 5 percent during the next three years with average growth likely to be well below 3 percent a year to accelerate the pace of growth the bank advocates an all out effort to create an advanced digital economy and other

posted on by martyrashrakat april 07 2019 by aleksandr khaldey translated by ollie richardson and angelina siard cross posted with source real revolutions are taking place not on squares but in the quiet of offices and that s why nobody noticed the world revolution that took place on march 29th 2019 only a small wave passed across the periphery of the information field and the momentum faded away because the situation was described in terms unclear to the masses no freedom equality brotherhood motherland or death or power to councils peace to the people bread to the hungry factories to the worker and land to the farmers none of these masterpieces of world populism were used and that s why what happened was understood in russia by only a few people and they made such comments that the masses either did not fully listen to them or did not read up to the end or they did listen to the end but didn t understand anything but they should ve because the world changed so cardinally that it is indeed time for nathan rothschild having crumpled a hat in his hand to climb onto an armoured rolls royce and to shout from on top of it to all the universe comrades the world revolution the need for which revolutionaries spoke about for a long time came true and he would be completely right it s just that the results of the revolution will be implemented slowly and that s why they are imperceptible for the population but the effects nevertheless will be soon seen by absolutely everyone up to the last cook who even doesn t seek to learn to govern the state soon this revolution is called basel iii and it was made by the bank for international settlements bis its essence is in the following bis runs the imf and this in turn runs the central banks of all countries the body of such control is called bcbs the basel committee on banking supervision it isn t just some worthless us state department or congress of american senators it s not a stupid pentagon a little department of the treasury which runs around like the cia s servant on standby or a house of collective farmers with the name white house this isn t even the banks of the us federal reserve which govern all of this wealth this is a government of all of them combined that real world government that people in the world try not to speak about aloud bcbs is the politburo of the world whose secretary general according to rumours is comrade baruch and the underground structure of the central committee is even more secret it has many euphemisms the most adequate of which is zurich gnomes this is what swiss bankers are called not even owners of commercial banks but namely those ordinary looking men sitting in the swiss city of basel who hitler who tried to attach the whole world to the third reich and who preserved neutrality with switzerland during all the war didn t dare to attack and as is known in switzerland besides swiss rifleman in reality there isn t even an army so who was the frenzied fuhrer afraid of nevertheless the recommendations that were made by bcbs on march 29th 2019 were immediately at the snap of the fingers accepted for execution by all the central banks of the world and our russian central bank is not an exception there is even the statement of the press service of the central bank of the russian federation posted on the official website of the central bank it is called concerning the terms of implementation of basel iii the planned world revolution was in 2017 magic of dates and digits or just a coincidence but it has started only now its essence is simple in the world the system of exclusive dollar domination established in 1944 in bretton woods and reformed in 1976 in jamaica where gold was recognised as an equivalent of world money that became invalid is being cancelled the dollar indeed became world money and gold became an ordinary exchange good like metal or sugar traded in london on commodity exchanges however the weather was determined there by only three firms of the pool of london that belong to an even smaller number of owners but nevertheless it s not gold but oil that became the dollar filler we have lived in such a world ever since gold was considered as a reserve of the third category for all banks from central to commercial ones where the reserves were first of all in dollars and bonds of the us the norms of basel iii demand an increase first of all in monetary reserves this impeded the volumes of monetary resources of banks that could be used to carry out expansion but it was a compulsory measure for saving the stability of a world banking system that showed to be insufficient in a crisis in russia pseudo patriots were very much indignant at this demanding to reject basel iii which they called a sign of a lack of sovereignty in reality this is a quite normal demand to observe international standards of bank security which were becoming more rigid but since we were not printing dollars so of course it had an impact on us and since the alternative is an exit from world financial communications into full isolation so our authorities of course did not want to accept such nonsense that was even designated by pseudo patriots as a lack of sovereignty to call sovereignty freedom to put your head in the noose is let s agree a strange interpretation of the term the basel iii decision meant that gold as a reserve of the third category was earlier estimated at 50 of its value on the balance sheets of world banks at the same time all owners of world money traded in gold not physically but on paper without the movement of real metal the volume of which in the world wasn t enough for real transactions this was done in order to push down the price of gold to keep it as low as possible first of all for the benefit of the dollar after all the dollar is tied to oil which had to cost no less than the price of one gram of gold per barrel and now it was decided to place gold not in the third but just in the first category and it means that now it is possible to evaluate it not at 50 but at 100 of its value this leads to the revaluation of the balance sheet total and concerning russia it means that now we can quietly on all legal grounds pour nearly 3 trillion rubles into the economy if to be precise it is 2 95 trillion rubles or 45 billion at the exchange rate in addition to the current balance sheet total the central bank of the russian federation can pour this money into our economy on all legal grounds how it will happen in reality isn t yet known haste here without calculating all the consequences is very dangerous although this emission is considered as noninflationary actually everything is much more complicated during the next few months nothing will change in the world the u turn will be very slow in the us the gold reserves officially total 8133 5 tons but there is such a thing as a financial multiplier for every gold dollar the banks print 20 30 digital paper ones i e the us can only officially receive 170 billion in addition but taking into account the multiplier 4 5 trillion this explains why the federal reserve system holds back on increasing interests rates and so far maintains the course towards lowering the balance sheet total they are cautious of a surge in hyperinflation but all the largest states and holders of gold will now revaluate their gold and foreign exchange reserves germany italy france russia china and switzerland countries where the gold reserves exceed 1 000 tons notice that there is no mumpish britain in this list its reserves are less than 1000 tons experts suspect that it is perhaps not a coincidence that the dates of brexit and the date of basel iii coincide the increased financial power of the leaders of europe germany and france is capable of completely concluding the dismantlement of britain on the european continent it was necessary to get out as soon as possible thus it seems that it is possible to congratulate us the dollar era lasting from 1944 to 2019 has ended now gold is restored in its rights and is not an exchange metal but world money on an equal basis with the dollar euro and british pound now gold will start to rise in price and its price will rise from 1200 1400 per troy ounce up to 1800 2000 by this autumn now it is clear why russia and china during all these years so persistently decanted its export income into the growth of gold reserves there is now such a situation where nobody in the world will sell gold injections of extra money will suffice for the world economy for 5 6 months in the us this money can be used to pay off the astronomical debt perhaps this wasn t zurich s last motive for making such a decision but after all the most important thing is an attempt to slip out from under the tower of pisa that is the falling dollar since the dollar and oil are connected the growth of the price of gold will directly affect the growth of the price of oil now a barrel costs as much as 1 627 grams of gold a price growth will cause the world economy where 85 of the money dollar supply turns into stock surrogates like shares bonds and treasuries to cave in the stock exchange will not be able to bundle together such an additional mass of money any more it will be good for oil industry workers even perhaps best of all but not for long the economical crash because of expensive oil will become a crash for all oil industry workers too it is precisely this that is the main reason why our rights for additional emissions can remain unused in full volume although a gift in such a form will not be completely ignored the may decrees of putin in the current context are being understood completely differently russia runs away from the oil based economic model in all ways including by political reforms and changing the elites however why is the decision of basel a revolution because from the autumn the financial flood in the world economy will begin it will entail the acceleration of russia and china s isolation from the dollar system and the crash of the economies that completely depend on the dollar the vassal countries of the us it will be worst of all for them and this means that the reasons for increased distancing between the eu and the us will increase in number manyfold a redrawing of the map of global unions awaits the world and the redrawing of these unions will be carried out not least by military methods or with their partial use but in one way or another reasoning involving force in the world will increase almost to the level of guaranteed war almost is our hope for rescue because the us loses all main instruments of influence on this world except force but it s not for this purpose that the zurich gnomes created this world so that the us is so simply turned into radioactive ashes the us will be drenched with cold water like a broken down nuclear reactor while the world has entered the zone of the most global transformations over the past few centuries the revolution that so many waited for were afraid of and spoke so much about has started buckle up and don t smoke the captain and crew wish you a pleasant flight share this share

2 a backloaded economic calendar the reasoning behind the lukewarm day on wall street overnight aside from just being a monday is the economic calendar is backloaded this week there seems to be a reluctance to get ahead of the data with the preference being to position for it and react to it as it comes such a milestone stands only 1 and a half per cent away for the s p500 and sensibly the market is in no rush to get there generally though the chatter in the commentariat betrays an overall confidence that the s p will get there as has been said a plenty before market conditions are looking quite goldilocksy only a little more fuel is required to propel us stocks to where bulls wish for them to be 1 an uneventful day on wall street a flat somewhat mixed and low activity day on wall street market participants seem to be eyeing events later on in the week after friday s non farm payroll induced rally traders have apparently looked down below their feet realised how far this market has climbed and decided a fresh wind is required before scaling to new record heights us cpi data and fomc minutes will be the releases for us markets and will for the bulls ideally confirm without qualification the fed s need to stay put on interest rates but brexit drama will also be closely monitored as we creep ever closer to the april 12 brexit deadline as will the imf s economic updates due mid week and the ecb s monetary policy meeting for insights into the global growth outlook 3 currency traders positioning for event risk in contrast to stock indices shuffling in currency markets was more pronounced on the litany of macro headline risk the central thread to the moves was a fall in the us dollar though much of this move came as an extension of positioning in the euro ahead of wednesday s ecb meeting just as much as it was a positioning for cpi data and fomc minutes growth appetite is generally higher it must be said though with commodity currencies such as the aud nzd cad and nok rising the latter two owing to a spike in oil prices and safe havens like the japanese yen and swiss franc falling 4 us earnings to determine wall street s fate looking slightly higher above the fray and us earnings season is coming up and may centre market participants minds a touch not that any tremendous surprises are forecast though earnings growth is expected to have softened a little this past quarter that much won t derail markets and estimates are that a healthier growth in us corporate earnings should return as 2019 unfolds only the severest miss in earnings growth would curtail the recent bull run across the s p500 and not to mention that with the us fed keeping yields and discount rates low the price to earnings ratio across the index remains relatively attractive while dividend yields are also becoming of greater appeal too

this story was funded by our members join longreads and help us to support more writers bryce covert longreads april 2019 13 minutes 3 374 words the american work ethic the motivation that drives americans to work longer hours each week and more weeks each year than any of our economic peers is a long standing contributor to america s success thus reads the first sentence of a massive report the trump administration released in july 2018 americans drive to work ever harder longer and faster is at the heart of the american dream the idea which has become more mythology than reality in a country with yawning income inequality and stagnating upward economic mobility that if an american works hard enough she can attain her every desire and we really try we put in between 30 to 90 minutes more each day than the typical european we work 400 hours more annually than the high output germans and clock more office time than even the work obsessed japanese the story of individual hard work is embedded into the very founding of our country from the supposedly self made entrepreneurial founding fathers to the pioneers who plotted the united states western expansion little do we acknowledge that the riches of this country were built on the backs of african slaves many owned by the founding fathers themselves whose descendants live under oppressive policies that continue to leave them with lower incomes and overall wealth and in greater poverty we the we who write the history books would rather tell ourselves that the people who shaped our country did it through their own hard work and not by standing on the shoulders or stepping on the necks of others it s an easier story to live with it s one where the people with power and money have it because they deserve it not because they took it and where we each have an equal shot at doing the same because for all our national pride in our puritanical work ethic the ethic doesn t apply evenly at the highest income levels wealthy americans are making money passively through investments and inheritances and doing little of what most would consider work basic subsistence may soon be predicated on whether and how much a poor person works while the rich count on tax credits and carve outs designed to protect stockpiles of wealth created by money begetting itself it s the poor who are expected to work the hardest to prove that they are worthy of americanness or a helping hand or humanity at the same time we idolize and imitate the rich if you re rich you must have worked hard you must be someone to emulate maybe you should even be president trump has a long history of antipathy to the poor a word which he uses as a synonym for welfare which he understands only as a pejorative when he and his father were sued by the department of justice in 1973 for discriminating against black tenants in their real estate business he shot back that he was being forced to rent to welfare recipients nearly 40 years later he called president obama our welfare food stamp president saying he doesn t believe in work he wrote in his 2011 book time to get tough there s nothing compassionate about allowing welfare dependency to be passed from generation to generation perhaps but trump certainly knows about relying on things passed from generation to generation his self styled origin story is that he got his start with a small 1 million loan from his real estate tycoon father fred c trump which he used to grow his own empire i built what i built myself he has claimed i did it by working long hours and working hard and working smart it s an interesting interpretation of myself a new york times investigation in october reported that instead trump has received at least 413 million from his father s businesses over the course of his life by age 3 mr trump was earning 200 000 a year in today s dollars from his father s empire he was a millionaire by age 8 by the time he was 17 his father had given him part ownership of a 52 unit apartment building reporters david barstow susanne craig and russ buettner wrote soon after mr trump graduated from college he was receiving the equivalent of 1 million a year from his father the money increased with the years to more than 5 million annually in his 40s and 50s the times found 295 different streams of revenue fred created to enrich his son loans that weren t repaid three trust funds shares in partnerships lump sum gifts much of it further inflated by reducing how much went to the government donald and his siblings helped their parents dodge taxes with sham corporations improper deductions and undervalued assets helping evade levies on gifts and inheritances if you re rich you must have worked hard you must be someone to emulate maybe you should even be president even the money that was made squarely owed a debt to the government fred trump nimbly rode the rising wave of federal spending on housing that began with the new deal and continued with the g i bill fred trump would become a millionaire many times over by making himself one of the nation s largest recipients of cheap government backed building loans the times reported donald carried on this tradition of milking government subsidies to accumulate fortunes he obtained at least 885 million in perfectly legal grants subsidies and tax breaks from new york to build his

morning and keep up with all our picks by subscribing to our daily update someone could have taken this largesse and worked hard to grow it into something more but donald trump was not that someone much of his fortune comes not from the down and dirty work of running businesses but from slapping his name on everything from golf courses to steaks many of these deals entail merely licensing his name while a developer actually runs things and as president he still doesn t seem inclined to clock much time doing actual work that hasn t stopped him from putting work at the center of his administration s poverty related policies in the white house council of economic advisers lengthy tome it argued for adding work requirements to a new universe of public benefits these requirements which up until the trump administration only existed for direct cash assistance and food stamps require a recipient not just to put in a certain number of hours at a job or some other qualifying activity but to amass paperwork to prove those hours each month the cea report is focused supposedly on the importance and dignity of work but the benefits of engaging in labor are only deemed important for a particular population welfare recipients who society expects to work over and over it takes for granted that our country only expects the poorest to work in order to prove themselves worthy of government funds specifically targeting those who get food stamps to feed their families housing assistance to keep roofs over their heads and medicaid to stay healthy the report doesn t just represent an ethos in the administration it was also a justification for concrete actions it had already taken and more it would soon roll out last april trump signed an executive order that ordered federal agencies to review public assistance programs in order to see if they could impose work requirements unilaterally to ensure that they are consistent with principles that are central to the american spirit work free enterprise and safeguarding human and economic resources as the document states while also reserving public assistance programs for those who are truly in need the administration has also pushed forward on its own in 2017 it announced that states could apply for waivers that would allow them to implement work requirements in medicaid for the first time and so far more than a dozen states have taken it up on the offer with arkansas s rule in effect since june 2018 it has now been halted by a federal judge in that state medicaid recipients had to spend 80 hours a month at work school or volunteering and report those activities to the government in order to keep getting health insurance and in april 2018 housing and urban development secretary ben carson unveiled a proposal to let housing authorities implement work requirements for public housing residents and rental assistance recipients trump pushed congress to include more stringent work requirements in the food stamp program as it debated the most recent farm bill arguing it would get america back to work when that effort failed the agriculture department turned around and proposed a rule to impose the requirements by itself these aren t fiscal necessities they re crackdowns on the poor justified by the idea that they should prove themselves worthy of the benefits that help them survive that are not just cruel but out of step with real life most people who turn to public programs already work and those who don t often have good reason more than 60 percent of people on medicaid are working they remain on medicaid because their pay isn t enough to keep them out of poverty and many of the low wage jobs they work don t offer health insurance they can afford of those not working most either have a physical impairment or conflicting responsibilities like school or caregiving enrollment in food stamps tells the same story among the work capable adults on food stamps about two thirds work at some point during the year while 84 percent live in a household where someone works but low wage work is often chaotic and unpredictable recipients are more likely to turn to food stamps during a spell of unemployment or too few hours then stop when they resume steadier employment many of those who are supposedly capable of work but don t have a job have a health barrier or live with someone who has one they re in school they re caring for family or they just can t find work in their community work requirements then fail to account for the reality of poor people s lives it s not that there s a widespread lack of work ethic among people who earn the least but that there s a lack of steady pay and consistent opportunities that allow someone to sustain herself and her family without assistance we also know work requirements just don t work they ve existed in the temporary assistance for needy families cash assistance program for decades yet they don t help people find meaningful lasting work instead they serve as a way to shove them out of programs they desperately need the result is more poverty not more jobs if this country were so concerned about helping people who might face barriers to working get jobs we might not be the second lowest among oecd member countries by percentage of gdp spent on labor market programs like job search assistance or retraining the poor in particular face barriers like affordable childcare and reliable transportation and could use education or training to reach for better paid more meaningful work but we do little to extend these supports instead we chastise them for not pulling on their frayed bootstraps hard enough help us fund our next story we ve published hundreds of original stories all funded by you including personal essays reported features and reading lists become a member we also seem content with the notion that a person who doesn t work either out of inability or refusal doesn t deserve the building blocks of staying alive the programs trump is targeting after all are about basic needs housing to stay safe from the elements food to keep from going hungry healthcare to receive treatment and avoid dying of neglect even if it were true that there was a horde of poor people refusing to work do we want to condemn them to starvation and likely death in one of the world s richest countries do we really balk at spending money on keeping our people even lazy ones alive we also know work requirements just don t work they ve existed in the temporary assistance for needy families cash assistance program for decades yet they don t help people find meaningful lasting work instead they serve as a way to shove them out of programs they desperately need the result is more poverty not more jobs plenty of other countries don t do so single mothers experience higher rates of destitution than coupled parents or people without children all over the world but the higher poverty rate in the u s as compared to other developed countries isn t because we have more single mothers instead it s because we do so little to help them compare us to denmark which gives parents unconditional cash benefits for each of their children regardless of whether or how much they work on top of generously subsidizing childcare offering universal health coverage and guaranteeing paid leave it s no coincidence that they also have a lower poverty rate both generally and for single mothers specifically a recent examination of poverty across countries found that children are at higher risk in the u s because we have a sparse social safety net that s so closely tied to demanding that people work it makes us an international outlier the world s miser that only opens a clenched fist to the poor if they re willing to demonstrate their worthiness first here too america s history of slavery and ongoing racism rears its head according to a trio of renowned economists we don t have a european style social safety net because racial animosity in the u s makes redistribution to the poor who are disproportionately black unappealing to many voters white people turn against funding public benefit programs when they feel their racial status threatened particularly benefits they falsely believe mainly accrue to black people the black poor are seen as the most undeserving of help and most in need of proving their worthiness to get it states with larger percentages of black residents for example focus less on tanf s goal of providing cash to the needy and have stingier benefits with higher hurdles to enrollment the cea s report on work requirements claimed that being an adult who doesn t work is particularly prevalent among those living in low income households but that s debatable the more income someone has the less likely he is to be getting it from wages in 2012 those earning less than 25 000 a year made nearly three quarters of that money from a job those making more than 10 million on the other hand made about half of their money from capital gains in other words returns on investments the bottom half of the country has on average just 826 in income from capital investments each the average for those in the top 1 percent is more than 16 million the richest are the least likely to have their money come from hard labor yet there s no moral panic over whether they re coddled or lacking in self reliance instead government benefits help the rich protect and grow idle wealth capital gains and dividends are taxed at a lower rate than regular salaried income inheritances were taxed at an average rate of 4 percent in 2009 compared to the average rate of 18 percent for money earned by working and saving when investments are bequeathed the recipient owes no taxes on any asset appreciation in fact government tax benefits that increase people s take home money at the expense of what the government collects for its own coffers overwhelmingly benefit the rich over the poor or even the middle class more than 60 percent of the roughly 900 billion in annual tax expenditures goes to the richest 20 percent of american families that figure dwarfs what the government expends on many public benefit programs the government spends more than three times as much on tax subsidies for homeowners mostly captured by the well to do than it does on rental assistance for the poor the three benefit programs the trump administration is concerned with medicaid food stamps and housing assistance come to about 705 billion in combined spending while the administration has been concerned with what it can do to compel the poor to work it s handed out more largesse to the idle rich its signature tax cut package the tax cuts and jobs act offered an extra cut for so called pass through businesses like law or real estate firms but the fine print included a wrinkle if someone is considered actively involved in his pass through business only 30 percent of his earnings could qualify for the new discount if someone is passively involved however a shareholder who doesn t do much about the day to day work of the company then he gets 100 percent of the new benefit then there s the law s significant lowering of the estate tax the tax is levied on only the biggest most valuable inheritances passed down from wealthy parent to newly wealthy child before the republicans tax bill only the richest 0 2 percent of estates had to pay the tax when fortunes changed hands now it s just the richest 0 1 percent or a mere 1 800 very wealthy families worth more than 22 million the rest get to pass money to their heirs tax free those who do pay it will be paying less when tax time comes due 4 4 million less to be exact despite the republican rhetoric that lowering the estate tax is about saving family farms it s really about allowing an aristocracy to calcify one in which rich parents ensure their children are rich before they lift a single finger in work as those heirs receive their fortunes they also receive the blessing that comes with riches the halo of success and therefore deservedness without having to work to prove it yet there s evidence that increasing taxes on inheritances has the potentially salutary effect of getting heirs to work more the more their inheritances are taxed the more they end up paying in labor taxes evidence that they re working harder for their livings not just coasting on generational wealth perhaps our tax code could encourage rich heirs to experience the dignity of work trump s cea report is accurate about at least one thing our country has a history of only offering public benefits to the poor either deemed worthy through their work or exempt through old age or disability an outlier was the aid to families with dependent children program which became temporary assistance for needy families after bill clinton signed welfare reform into law in the 90s but the 1996 transformation of the program took what was a promise of cash for poor mothers and changed it into an obstacle course of proving a mother s worth before she can get anywhere close to a check it paved the way for the current administration s obsession with work requirements largesse for the rich on the other hand has rarely included such tests no one has been made to pee in a cup for tax breaks on their mortgages which cost as much as the food stamp program but overwhelmingly benefit families that earn more than 100 000 no one has had to prove a certain number of work hours to get a lower tax rate on investment income or an inheritance they get that discount on their money without having to do any work at all we haven t always been so extreme in our dichotomous treatment of the rich and poor throughout the 1940s 50s and 60s we coupled high marginal taxes on the wealthy with a minimum wage that ensured that people who put in full time work could rise out of poverty the estate tax has been as high as 77 percent as dutch historian rutger bregman recently told an audience of the ultrawealthy at davos we re living proof that high taxes can spread shared prosperity the united states that s where it has actually worked in the 1950s during republican president eisenhower he pointed out this is not rocket science it was during the same era that we also created significant anti poverty programs such as social security medicare and medicaid in fact this country pioneered the idea of progressive taxation and has always had some form of tax on inheritance to avoid creating an aristocracy but we ve papered over that history as tax rates have cratered and poverty has climbed instead as reaganomics and neoliberal ideas took hold of our politics we turned back to the horatio alger myth that success is attained on an individual basis by hard work alone and that riches are the proof of a dogged drive lower tax rates naturally follow under the theory that the rich should keep more of their deserved bounty and if you re poor coming to the government seeking a helping hand up you failed the country is due for a reckoning with our obsession with work there are certainly financial and emotional benefits that come from having a job but why are we only concerned with whether the poor reap those benefits is working ourselves to the bone the best signifier of our worth and are there basic elements of life that we should guarantee regardless of work it doesn t mean dropping all emphasis on work ethic but it does require a deeper examination of who we expect to work and why bryce covert

2 a backloaded economic calendar the reasoning behind the lukewarm day on wall street overnight aside from just being a monday is the economic calendar is backloaded this week there seems to be a reluctance to get ahead of the data with the preference being to position for it and react to it as it comes such a milestone stands only 1 and a half per cent away for the s p500 and sensibly the market is in no rush to get there generally though the chatter in the commentariat betrays an overall confidence that the s p will get there as has been said a plenty before market conditions are looking quite goldilocksy only a little more fuel is required to propel us stocks to where bulls wish for them to be 1 an uneventful day on wall street a flat somewhat mixed and low activity day on wall street market participants seem to be eyeing events later on in the week after friday s non farm payroll induced rally traders have apparently looked down below their feet realised how far this market has climbed and decided a fresh wind is required before scaling to new record heights us cpi data and fomc minutes will be the releases for us markets and will for the bulls ideally confirm without qualification the fed s need to stay put on interest rates but brexit drama will also be closely monitored as we creep ever closer to the april 12 brexit deadline as will the imf s economic updates due mid week and the ecb s monetary policy meeting for insights into the global growth outlook 3 currency traders positioning for event risk in contrast to stock indices shuffling in currency markets was more pronounced on the litany of macro headline risk the central thread to the moves was a fall in the us dollar though much of this move came as an extension of positioning in the euro ahead of wednesday s ecb meeting just as much as it was a positioning for cpi data and fomc minutes growth appetite is generally higher it must be said though with commodity currencies such as the aud nzd cad and nok rising the latter two owing to a spike in oil prices and safe havens like the japanese yen and swiss franc falling 4 us earnings to determine wall street s fate looking slightly higher above the fray and us earnings season is coming up and may centre market participants minds a touch not that any tremendous surprises are forecast though earnings growth is expected to have softened a little this past quarter that much won t derail markets and estimates are that a healthier growth in us corporate earnings should return as 2019 unfolds only the severest miss in earnings growth would curtail the recent bull run across the s p500 and not to mention that with the us fed keeping yields and discount rates low the price to earnings ratio across the index remains relatively attractive while dividend yields are also becoming of greater appeal too
by cbus20122 earnings are set to decelerate over the next few quarters this comes at a time where we are seeing much more difficult yoy comps after a 3 year earnings bull market accelerated by unprecedented late cycle tax cuts there are still huge builds in semiconductor inventory as prices are shitting the bed this comes at a time where many semiconductor ceo s are suddenly global macro economists and telling everyone that the market will bottom in q2 fwiw semiconductor slowdown cycles have never lasted just one quarter but the market seems to believe this narrative regardless capex which fueled a lot of this recent bull market it certainly hasn t been the consumer is set to come down significantly for a variety of reasons first off cloud technology which has been the biggest winner in the last few years is becoming much more mature it will still be relevant but we re far past the point where companies are just shifting towards expansion here second and this is very crucial there are a lot of companies sitting at a bbb credit rating those companies are going to be using their excess cash and revenues to pay down debt not to increase capex since being downgraded to junk would cause a lot of problems for them while lowering their share price as well of course third notice the huge wave of ipo s coming online these are all companies that are non profitable and spend a huge amount of money in capex this has been funded by vc s over the years on the premise that they can offload their shares to the public market at a profit based on the growth narrative the issue is that once they re in the public domain they will have to be much more accountable to returns and this will once again increase pressure on growing towards profitability and decreasing their malinvestment capex spending this is a signature behavior of market tops the internals of the economy that i track auto sector housing and some others are all doing extremely negative right now auto sales have been trending downward for quite some time and we re now seeing the largest auto job cut announcements since the crisis housing has not been a good place to be either not saying we re in a bubble but looking at performance of housing is a wonderful indicator of the cycle other sectors similarly have been kind of bad transports have diverged in the bigger picture from the s p 500 and to nobody s surprise a very typical late cycle dynamic has come into play where sectors that do well in 9th innings are of course greatly outperforming right now international trade is shitting the bed and this isn t just a us china trade war issue south korea exports have been sinking european exports have been sinking japanese exports have been sinking etc etc this is being reflected by ism prints and a lot of very negative items many people in the market legitimately thinks that the chinese trade war is the biggest reason we ve seen an enormous global slowdown as a result they keep buying based on the fact that trump keeps dangling a trade war resolution fwiw i don t think the trade war is positive of course but there are many bigger problems than this out there all the positive items that have caused the markets to rally are based on the undying belief that central banks can and will backstop the markets at any cost but this is a bit naive and doesn t reflect reality of these cycles most market tops are accompanied by central banks shifting to a much more dovish narrative and cutting rates outside the usa s borders there are some enormous real estate bubbles canadian real estate is a problem australian real estate is a bigger problem and then there are other areas of the world such as scandinavia new zealand etc that all have their own real estate bubbles prices in these markets have been declining and the marginal demand is gone fwiw most of the marginal demand came from chinese capital flight but the problem is that xi has clamped down on capital flight x10 in order to stabilize china s current currency situation as they stimulate so even if we see a renewed boom in chinese credit expansion we will likely see the periphery real estate bubbles deflate along with this i ve spoken ad nauseam about china on here and i think it s the biggest existential threat to the world economy we used to be in a world where if the usa sneezes the world catches a cold that s still true but we re also in a situation where if china sneezes the world catches a cold given that they re responsible for the largest increases in commodity demand and global growth since the gfc and as i ve mentioned china being in an enormous bubble we re all basically depending on them reflating their credit bubble in order to keep all of this going similarly europe looks to be a mess and they have little to no room to further stimulate without causing increasing currency pressures on the euro and increased political pressures despite them stimulating parts of europe looks to already be in a recession partially related to chinese demand weakening and a simple lack of overall growth europe s banking sector looks atrocious and their zombie corporations are weighing on productivity drastically despite this europe at least is cheap from an equity perspective but that is likely for a good reason one of my concerns here is that a declining forex value of the euro will actually put more and more pressure on the dollar which will then cause more and more pressure on the rest of the world emerging markets and real estate bubbles yield curve has inverted which can structurally cause further decrease in capex spending and lending to businesses around the country late cycle employment tightness causes rising wages phillips curve this is cutting into peak profit margins at a time where we are seeing some slowdowns in demand overall beyond all of this demographics are looking absolutely awful over the next 10 15 years for the world at large europe and china have demographics not too different from japan before they had their big bust and deflation overall one of the biggest points i ve been trying to make about this cycle is that the usa economy is likely to lag the rest of the world and follow the rest of the world into a recession type event this is contrary to what we usually expect where we lead the world into a recession in 2007 2009 and 2000 2002 we actually have a stronger likelihood of seeing a blowoff top type bubble in the usa coincident with a stronger dollar than most other countries but that remains to be seen either way there is a ton more complexity out there and even independent of all the risks it s still important to get the timing right my main cue i m watching is various signals in certain unemployment rate metrics when this trends towards higher unemployment you typically see shit hit the fan pretty quickly we re not quite there yet but there are some problematic signs right now either way i ve trimmed a lot of risk and am pretty happy with being positioned heavily in treasury bonds right now timing these things is always very tough and the market can remain irrational longer than most people can remain solvent but i don t think it s as hard as some make it out to be to implement some basic risk management in their portfolio if they know what to look for and how to track it we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us edit adding a note in here since this became a lot more popular than i realized it would don t be stupid and don t buy tons of yolo put options even if you have a long term bearish outlook like me getting the timing on these things right specifically is very tough and any bear market rallies will have you doubting whether your core thoughts are actually correct or if the markets are anticipating a bottom already also there are some potential green shoots out there some of which is coming from china as they try to stimulate their economy but determining whether those potential green shoots are real or not is one of the more difficult things out there

anyone interacting with the u s health care system is bound to encounter examples of unnecessary administrative complexity from filling out duplicative intake forms to transferring medical records between providers to sorting out insurance bills this administrative complexity with its associated high costs is often cited as one reason the united states spends double the amount per capita on health care compared with other high income countries even though utilization rates are similar 1 each year health care payers and providers in the united states spend about 496 billion on billing and insurance related bir costs according to center for american progress estimates presented in this issue brief as health care costs continue to rise a logical starting point for potential savings is addressing waste a 2010 report by the national academy of medicine nam estimated that the united states spends about twice as much as necessary on bir costs 2 that administrative excess currently amounts to 248 billion annually according to cap s calculations this issue brief provides an overview of administrative expenditures in the u s health care system it first explains the components of administrative costs and then presents estimates of the administrative costs borne by payers and providers finally the issue brief describes how the united states can lower administrative costs through comprehensive reforms and incremental changes to its health care system many of the universal health care plans being discussed to expand coverage and lower costs would lower administrative costs through rate regulation global budgeting or simplifying the number of payers 3 each of these financing changes deserves consideration even in the absence of major systemwide reform components of administrative costs the main components of administrative costs in the u s health care system include bir costs and hospital or physician practice administration 4 the first category bir costs is part of the administrative overhead that is baked into consumers insurance premiums and providers reimbursements it includes the overhead costs for the health insurance industry and providers costs for claims submission claims reconciliation and payment processing the health care system also requires administration beyond bir activities including medical record keeping hospital management initiatives that monitor and improve care quality and programs to combat fraud and abuse to date few studies have estimated the systemwide cost of health care administration extending beyond bir activities in a 2003 article in the new england journal of medicine researchers steffie woolhandler terry campbell and david himmelstein concluded that overall administrative costs in 1999 amounted to 31 percent of total health care expenditures or 294 billion5 roughly 569 billion today when adjusted for medical care inflation 6 31 of total health care expenditures in 1999 were from administrative costs or 294 billion roughly 569 billion today when adjusted for medical care inflation 7 billing and insurance related costs many studies of administrative costs limit their scope to bir costs the bir component of administration is most relevant to systemwide reforms that seek to reduce the expenses related to claims processing billing rates or health insurance the largest share of bir costs is attributable to insurance companies profits and overhead and to providers8 where bir costs include tasks such as record keeping for claims submission and billing the costs associated with bir administration can extend beyond the chief parties involved in receiving and submitting claims the process of claims denials has become an industry unto itself with private firms squeezing dollars out of medicaid programs 9 one study estimated that the aggregate value of challenged claims ranges from 11 billion to 54 billion annually 10 claims can also be manipulated to boost providers or insurers profits by recording services rendered in maximum detail and exaggerating the severity of patients conditions a practice known as upcoding 11 upcoding costs medicare advantage billions of dollars in excess expenditures 12 and in many cases the practice constitutes fraud 13 the nam published one of the most thorough reports on u s administrative costs related to billing and insurance in 2010 in a synthesis of the literature on administrative costs the nam report concluded that bir costs totaled 361 billion in 2009 about 466 billion in current dollars among private insurers public programs and providers amounting to 14 4 percent of u s health care spending at the time the nam estimated that bir costs account for 13 percent of physician care spending 8 5 percent of hospital care spending 10 percent of spending on other providers 12 3 percent of spending on private insurance and 3 5 percent of public program spending including medicare and medicaid 14 applying the nam s percentages of bir costs to recent projections of national health expenditures from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms cap estimates that bir costs will amount to 496 billion for 2019 15 see table 1 according to cap s calculations this includes 158 billion in overhead for private insurance 56 billion for administration of public insurance programs and 282 billion for the bir costs of hospitals physicians and other care providers cap s estimate does not include the administrative costs associated with retail sales of medical products including prescription drugs and durable medical equipment even the most inclusive studies of administrative costs have not included at least one key piece of the u s health care system namely patients 16 the administrative complexity of the u s system also burdens patients whether they are deciphering bewildering bills or shuttling records between providers three quarters of consumers report being confused by medical bills and explanations of benefits 17 a kaiser family foundation survey of people newly enrolled in the health insurance marketplace found that many were not confident in their understanding of the definitions of basic terms and concepts such as premium deductible or provider network 18 insurers and employers spend an estimated 4 8 billion annually to assist consumers with low health insurance literacy according to the consulting firm accenture 19 excess administrative costs while u s administrative care spending is indisputably higher than that of other comparable countries it s unclear how much of the difference is excess and how much of that excess could be trimmed the nam report estimated that excess bir costs amount to 190 billion 245 billion in current dollars or roughly half of total bir expenditures in a year 20 the nam report estimated that 66 percent of bir costs for private insurers and 50 percent of bir costs among providers are excess 21 based on these percentages 248 billion of the total 496 billion bir costs in cap s updated estimate are excess administrative costs most studies that have attempted to identify excess costs in the american health care system rely on comparisons between the united states and canada 22 in their 2010 review of the literature on the difference between the two countries health expenditures economists alexis pozen and david m cutler looked at the sources of the gap between u s and canadian health spending they found that 62 percent of the difference between the two countries was attributable to prices and intensity of care and 38 percent was linked to administrative costs 23 compared with canada the united states has 44 percent more administrative staff and u s physicians dedicate about 50 percent more time on administrative tasks 24 inflated to current dollars and today s population pozen and cutler s estimate of per capita administrative excess in the united states when compared with canada translates into a gap of 340 billion 25 woolhandler and himmelstein estimate that the united states currently spends 1 1 trillion on health care administration and of that amount 504 billion is excess 26 woolhandler and himmelstein rely on surveys of physicians time use and utilized physician income data to translate the share of time physicians spend on administrative tasks into monetary value their estimate of excess costs is the difference between u s and canadian administrative spending27 woolhandler and himmelstein s original 2003 article estimated that canada spent 307 per capita on health system administration compared with 1 059 per capita in the united states assuming this difference is excess requires an assumption that a canadian style health care system would achieve an identical level of administrative costs in the united states a separate criticism of the original 2003 woolhandler and himmelstein estimates as articulated by henry j aaron an economist at the brookings institution is that their methodology failed to account for differences in prices 28 woolhandler and himmelstein arrive at their national total administrative costs by tallying up costs in each country for items such as rent and salaries as a consequence the u s canada comparison captures not just the differences in the quantity of resources devoted to administration such as physician time or office space but also the differences in office rates wages and salaries taking woolhandler and himmelstein s estimate of total administrative costs as a given and then making standard adjustments for price differences aaron argues that the two researchers exaggerated u s administrative spending in their 2003 report and that the true portion of excess would be about one quarter less than what they estimated all estimates of administrative costs are inherently sensitive to what portion of health care spending one considers administrative 29 for example time spent recording diagnosis or prescription information used in billing may also be vital for patient care allowing medical teams to share up to date information or avoid harmful drug interactions a recent study of an electronic health records ehr system estimated that on average half of a primary care physician s day is spent on ehr interaction including billing coding ordering and communication 30 such tasks however can fall into a gray area between administrative and clinical in a separate study economist julie sakowski and her fellow researchers reported finding varying attitudes among physicians about whether interaction with electronic medical records a subset of ehr represented administrative or clinical time as sakowski and co authors wrote some felt they spent extra effort adding documentation that was needed only for billing others seemed to feel that nearly all of that information was needed for accurate clinical records 31 administrative costs for payers within the u s system the share of expenditures that are attributable to administrative costs varies greatly by payer the bir costs for traditional medicare and medicaid hover around 2 percent to 5 percent while those for private insurance is about 17 percent 32 some public finance experts including robert book have argued that the low levels of medicare overhead are deceptive because seniors have relatively high health expenditures the argument goes administrative costs make up a relatively small share of their total health care spending however medicare s per capita administrative expenditures are higher than those in other forms of insurance 33 even if one compares higher end estimates of medicare administrative costs to low end estimates of costs for private insurance the gulf between administrative costs for medicare and private coverage is large 34 organisation for economic co operation and development oecd data also show that other nations are able to achieve low levels of administrative costs while maintaining universal coverage across all ages of the population 35 international health system data demonstrate that the united states is a clear outlier on administrative spending and while the oecd s definition includes administrative costs to government public insurance funds and private insurance but not those borne by hospitals physicians and other providers the stark difference is still informative in 2016 administration accounted for 8 3 percent of total health care expenditures in the united states the largest share among comparable nations see figure 1 countries with single payer systems are among those with the lowest administrative costs for example administrative spending accounts for just 2 7 percent of total health care expenditures in canada 36 oecd data also show that within a country administrative costs are higher in private insurance than in government run programs 37 countries that have multipayer systems with stricter rate regulation also achieve much lower administrative costs than the united states administrative expenditures account for 4 8 percent of total health care expenditures in germany 3 9 percent in the netherlands 3 8 percent in switzerland and 1 6 percent in japan according to the oecd if the united states could reduce administrative costs down to canadian levels it would save 68 percent of current administrative expenditures reducing to german level administrative costs would save 42 percent of current administrative expenditures however to assume that by simply adapting another country s health care system whether it is canada s single payer medicare germany s sickness funds or switzerland s heavily regulated private plans the united states would automatically achieve the same level of administrative costs may ignore other fundamental differences between countries including the market power of health care providers political systems and attitudes toward health care nevertheless the experience of other multipayer systems such as those in germany and switzerland suggests that the united states could substantially reduce both administrative expenditures and overall health care spending by bringing down reimbursement rates and regulating insurance even while continuing to allow multiple payers and private health care providers the lowest possible level of administrative spending for the u s health care system is not necessarily the optimal level of spending as researchers robert a berenson and bryan e dowd have noted administrative spending in medicare may in fact be too low the program would be more efficient with greater investment in initiatives to lower costs and improve quality 38 many reforms that could generate overall savings require administrative resources to design and implement innovations such as bundled payments the practice of paying providers a lump sum for an episode of care such as a knee replacement or childbirth rather than reimbursing each individual component involve upfront investment in development increasing resources to combat fraud and abuse would also lower overall spending while the u s department of health and human services hhs boasts that it sees a 5 return on every 1 it puts toward fraud and abuse investigations that number indicates that the government may be underinvesting in those efforts 39 administrative costs for health care providers a number of studies have focused on the administrative costs borne by providers beyond bir expenses hospitals physician practices and other health care institutions house departments that are complementary to clinical services such as medical libraries public relations and accounting 40 a study of administrative costs in california found that administrative costs represented about one quarter of physician revenue and one fifth of hospital revenue and bir costs accounted for roughly half of administrative expenditures for physician and hospital services covered by private insurance 41 see figure 2 in a separate study himmelstein and others reported that one quarter of u s hospital spending went toward administration they found little difference between nonprofit hospitals and for profit institutions where administrative spending was 25 percent and 27 2 percent of total spending respectively 42 on a per encounter basis bir costs vary as a proportion of overall cost depending on the type of visit in a 2018 study of an academic health care system phillip tseng and others found that professional billing costs amounted to 20 49 for a primary care visit 61 54 for an emergency department visit and 124 26 for a general inpatient stay 43 relative to the professional revenue associated with each encounter studied the emergency department visit ranked the highest with billing costs equal to 25 2 percent of revenue inpatient visits were the lowest at 8 percent of a general inpatient stay and 3 1 percent for inpatient surgery 44 encounters involving hospital care incurred additional facility level billing costs see figure 3 in addition to the dollar cost of bir activity the study also reported the time spent on administration for typical encounters the average processing time was 13 minutes for a primary care visit 32 minutes for an emergency department visit and 73 minutes for a general inpatient stay 45 among other research on provider bir costs a 2009 study by larry casalino and others estimated that the cost of the time physicians spend on interactions with health plans is about 23 billion to 31 billion per year 46 a 2011 study by dante morra of the university of toronto and others estimated that interaction with payers costs the equivalent of 22 205 per physician annually in canada and 82 975 per physician annually in the united states suggesting that the united states would save 27 6 billion annually if u s administrative costs could be brought down to canadian levels 47 as with bir costs provider administrative costs in the united states are higher than those in other comparable countries hospital administrative costs in the united states far exceed those of other nations in their comparison of hospital administrative costs among eight western nations himmelstein and co authors found that the united states had the highest levels at 25 3 percent of total hospital expenditures 48 they conclude that in nations where hospital administrators have minimal responsibilities for procuring financing and where the hospital reimbursement system is least complex administrative costs can be reduced to 12 percent of expenditures 49 these findings suggest that reforms that introduce global budgeting or limit the need to bargain with multiple payers could potentially bring down excess hospital administrative costs in the united states lower administrative costs in single payer and multipayer systems although administrative costs contribute to the high expenditures in the united states they are not the primary reason for the health care spending gap as economist uwe reinhardt and others candidly put it it s the prices stupid 50 the united states pays more for care than other countries do both for administrative services and for other components of health care policies that target administrative costs alone would not necessarily bring overall u s health care expenditures in line with other countries as economists sherry glied and adam sacarny observed there are very substantial variations in administrative costs among countries with universal health insurance which do not translate directly into variations in overall costs 51 comparative evidence from u s states also suggests that america s multipayer system explains some but by no means all of the discrepancy between the united states and other developed nations harvard university researchers joseph p newhouse and anna sinaiko observe that there is considerable variation across the states in spending levels with the lowest quintile of states spending approximately the same percentage as the higher spending oecd countries other than the u s this implies that the pluralistic financing system may not be an important cause of the large percentage of gdp that the u s devotes to health care 52 systemwide reforms to lower administrative costs health care financing experts believe that changes to how americans pay for coverage could dramatically reduce administrative costs researchers simulating the effects of single payer programs have assumed that administrative costs would be brought down substantially the urban institute set administrative costs at a plausible 6 percent of health care claims for their simulation of the single payer plan proposed by sen bernie sanders i vt noting that they do not believe that administrative costs can fall far below this level far too many administrative functions must be conducted 53 in its analysis of a single payer system for new york state the rand corporation assumed administrative costs at 6 percent of total health expenditures in its base case representing a reduction from 18 percent among commercial insurers and 7 percent in new york s medicaid program rand specified administrative costs at 13 percent and 3 percent in its alternative scenarios 54 in a separate column however rand researcher jodi liu cautioned that achieving the administrative expenditure levels of other countries may be aspirational and is not guaranteed under a single payer system 55 exactly how such lower costs could be achieved is another question reducing bir costs requires simplifying the billing and payment process which could be accomplished in a number of ways two avenues for reducing administrative costs as well as overall health costs are global budgeting and uniform rate setting 56 these two concepts are central to health systems around the world and are also responsible for keeping administrative costs lower whether a country has a multipayer or single payer system another paperwork reducing option would be a centralized claims clearinghouse to allow providers to submit all claims to a single entity as they do in germany and japan 57 all payer rates and global budgeting setting all payer reimbursement rates would eliminate the need for providers to negotiate rates with individual private insurers while also giving policymakers better leverage for controlling overall health care cost growth in the current u s system providers charge different rates to different payers and the billing process is complicated and opaque the list prices that hospitals are now required to publish bear little connection to what individual patients or those patients insurers actually pay 58 setting all payer rates would simplify billing and improve transparency by establishing a single set of rates for each provider while also giving regulators a tool to protect consumers from exorbitant rates 59 global budgeting the practice of paying providers revenue based on their expected costs also holds promise for both lowering administrative spending and overall costs as opposed to traditional fee for service payments which reward providers for doing more global budgeting incentivizes providers to deliver care more efficiently 60 global budgeting is a feature of many countries with much lower health care administrative costs including scotland wales and germany 61 as woolhandler campbell and himmelstein point out in their 2003 article the existence of global budgets in canada has eliminated most billing and minimized internal cost accounting since charges do not need to be attributed to individual patients and insurers 62 as germany shows both single payer and multipayer systems can use global budgets a system combining all payer rates and global budgeting is already partially in place in the state of maryland where each hospital has a single set of rates it bills to medicare medicaid commercial insurers and other payers maryland s system is keeping overall cost growth lower than the national trend 63 according to rand analysis of hospital costs maryland hospitals have administrative costs that are 9 percent lower than the national average and not far off from the 13 percent savings rand assumed providers would achieve under a single payer system 64 centralized claims processing germany and japan both have multiple payers but centralized claims processing 65 despite having more than 3 000 health plans 66 japan s administrative expenditures were a stunningly low 1 6 percent of overall health care costs in 2015 one of the lowest among oecd member nations 67 in their analysis of three universal health care options for vermont including single payer researchers william c hsiao steven kappel and jonathan gruber estimated substantial savings from administrative simplicity from each option the two single payer options they examined would result in even greater administrative savings of between 7 3 percent and 7 8 percent depending on the rate setting mechanism 68 the group estimated that a third scenario which would establish a centralized claims clearinghouse while allowing multiple payers could generate savings equal to 3 6 percent of total expenditures 69 this suggests that about half of the total administrative savings from a single payer system could be obtained within a regulated multipayer system policy proposals directed at administrative costs while major changes to the u s health care system have the greatest potential to bring down costs more incremental changes could reduce administrative waste a recent bill proposed by sens bill cassidy r la and tina smith d mn would direct the hhs secretary to set goals to cut unnecessary costs and administrative burdens throughout the health care system by 50 percent over the next 10 years it would also provide grant money for state based efforts to bring down administrative costs 70 some possible avenues for achieving those kinds of reductions include changes to payment rules improvements to facilitate electronic record keeping and information exchange and simplification of public insurance programs in their 2009 article in the new england journal of medicine david cutler elizabeth wikler and peter basch proposed one such package of reforms the authors estimated that providers could save 17 9 billion to 23 billion annually with several more incremental changes to the system including greater adoption of ehr systems integrated administrative and clinical systems national and standardized reporting requirements and credentialing of providers streamlined enrollment in public insurance programs and greater automation 71 in a separate report the same authors proposed additional reforms that they estimated could reduce excess administrative costs by 40 billion or 25 percent of total health care expenditures 72 in a 2010 study published in health affairs bonnie b blanchfield and other massachusetts researchers concluded that the administrative burden on physician organizations could be reduced by a single transparent set of payment rules for a system with multiple payers the authors recommended that the united states adopt a standard set of payment requirements increased payment rule transparency standardized forms and a standard set of data exchange requirements doing so could save 7 billion in billing costs for physician and other clinical services according to the authors estimates 73 conclusion although estimates vary a large body of evidence shows that the united states is spending about twice as much as needed on the administration of health care other nations enjoy world class health care systems while spending a fraction of what the united states does on governance billing and insurance a structural overhaul of how health care is financed and priced that includes key features of other countries systems whether one payer or many would go a long way toward eliminating excess administrative costs simplifying the payment system should be an essential part of future health reform and would make the u s system work better for taxpayers and patients

we have written much about the notion of inflation we don t want to rehash our many previous points but to look at the idea of purchasing power from a new angle purchasing power is assumed to be intrinsic to the currency we have said that the problem with the word inflation is that it treats two different phenomena as if they are the same one is the presumed effect of rising quantity of dollars the other is the effect of rising regulatory and tax burdens let s use milk as an example suppose milk was 1 per gallon many would say that a dollar is worth one gallon of milk or alternatively a dollar s purchasing power is one gallon of milk suppose that later the price of milk goes up to 2 then people say that the dollar s purchasing power falls by 50 percent to half a gallon of milk regardless of what you call it everyone would agree that the dollar buys less than it did until now let us explain one can think of production as buying a bunch of ingredients and mixing them together in a certain way to create the product for example milk comes from the ingredients of land cows ranch labor dairy labor dairy capital equipment distribution labor distribution capital and consumable containers now suppose this is purely hypothetical and could never happen in the real world the government enacted a regulation dairy farmers are required to tag every cow this adds some new ingredients to the milk product consumable tags tag labor and tag capital equipment related artificial intelligence replace the military next the government decides that it wants dairy farmers to pay for its costs to inspect the tags and audit the tag tracking records add government inspector labor to the list of ingredients regulation after regulation is passed controlling the use of land the number and treatment of the cows the workers etc etc by the time all s said and all s done the cost to produce a gallon of milk is ten times higher of course the retail price of milk is not directly connected to the cost of producing it if you doubt this then maybe you will go out and buy a new bmw 750 and then tell your boss that now your cost of living is higher and therefore your wage must go up in all seriousness if milk producers could charge more then they would already be charging more a rising cost of production is the producer s problem however no one can sell at a loss for long so what happens in reality is that producers try to raise their prices some consumers are unable to buy milk at a higher price others are unwilling the marginal milk buyer stops buying milk and may switch to a substitute the net result is the bankruptcy of some dairy producers a decline in the quantity of milk purchased by consumers and much higher prices in our example the cost to produce went up by 10x the price to buy milk will likely end up close to that there are other variables that can affect price in a real economy of course in this light we can see that it is not right to say that the dollar s purchasing power went down 90 percent the dollar is paying for just as much as it did previously it s just that the things it buys are increasingly not the things that consumers care about or even know about things like supersized americans with disabilities bathrooms for dairy workers extra motel stays for milk truck drivers do to mandatory stops forced vitamin d addition special plastic jugs taxes fees permits licenses etc a lot of labor and capital goes into all this government mandated stuff if we look at each of them as an additional ingredient that is now necessary to produce milk we can see that it s not that the dollar went down it s that more ingredients went into the milk milk really went up there are four points we hope that readers will take home from this first the term purchasing power suggests something that is untrue it suggests that the quantity of milk that can be bought for a dollar is intrinsic to the dollar and has nothing to do with what goes into producing milk two whatever the word for forcing milk producers to add more and more useless ingredients may be that word should not be the same as the one that refers to monetary debasement three people should demand the repeal of laws that force milk producers and car producers and home producers and every other kind of producer to add ingredients that increase the cost without increasing the value and four the federal reserve deserves the blame for many ills but this is not one of them related chinese tech giant tencent completes asia s largest bond sale add this to the list of reasons why the dollar cannot be measured in consumer prices why it is not proper to say that a dollar is worth one tenth of a gallon of milk supply and demand fundamentals if you read gold analysis much you will come across two ideas one inflation so called rising consumer prices is not only running much higher than the official statistic but is about to really start skyrocketing two buy gold because gold will hedge it that is the price of gold will go up as fast or faster than the price of gold well consumer prices are not rising as a consequence of monetary policy if they re rising it s despite the falling interest rate and due to the government constantly forcing producers to add more and more ingredients to the production of everything so why would we expect the price of gold to rise to match the never ending addition of compliance costs to milk and cars and petrol and pharmaceuticals in the short term speculators can bid up the price of gold in response to a rumor of inflation of de dollarization of an economy of fed policy changes etc but sooner or later if that s all it is speculators front running a rumor the price will quickly revert in a long term graph the blip will disappear into the noise in the long term the price of gold will move as the people not merely leveraged speculators amped up on the latest internet rumor perceive that the dollar s demise draws near or as gold s utility grows after an 85 year government imposed hiatus both trends are marching forward in order to achieve this post 2008 boom central banks have pumped out enormous amounts of credit in every currency how much we came across this graph that illustrates the problem in a space not typically analyzed small cap stocks click to enlarge look at the incredible growth of debt and the modest growth of earnings from the peak in 2008 until now earnings grew by 120 percent but the debt that finances these earnings grew by 264 percent that is a big increase in leverage or alternatively we might say that these 2000 companies are consuming their investors capital to put this in perspective in 11 years these companies collectively added 387b in debt but they grew earnings by only 98b the marginal productivity of this debt here used to mean change in ebitda per dollar of added debt is 0 25 this not only makes these companies more brittle more vulnerable to a downturn but there is another problem each one s added debt comes to other companies including many russell 2000 companies as revenues this means that when credit tightens again revenues will drop as a direct consequence of one firm s cessation of borrowing to buy the products of another or pay its employees salaries which are spend on the products of another there is a synergistic effect at work here it s great fun on the way up and politicians all around the world love to take credit for it and it will be great pain on the way down by keith weiner more top reads from safehaven com

by robert a dye phd senior vice president and chief economist and joe bradshaw economic research assistant comerica bank the us economic expansion is long in the tooth at 115 months as of january 2019 the longest ever us expansion was 120 months over the decade of the 1990s as the us business cycle ages the odds of the next recession occurring within a two year window increase we currently place the odds of the next us recession occurring within 24 months of january 2019 at about 50 percent and moving higher with increasing odds of a us recession come increasing odds of recession for other western hemisphere economies that have both direct and indirect trading relationships with the united states downside risk factors for the us economy fall into three main buckets policy errors rest of world growth and corporate balance sheets government policy may play a key role in the next us recession trade policy with china may become even more restrictive in 2019 to the detriment of both countries near term outlooks the partial federal government shutdown was also a matter of policy it marginally reduced first quarter gross domestic product gdp at a time when other headwinds were building fiscal policy may quickly pivot from expansive in 2018 due to tax reform to restrictive in late 2019 if federal spending dips heading into fiscal year 2020 monetary policy runs the usual risk of over tightening in 2019 as the federal funds rate nears its peak for the cycle while the federal reserve s balance sheet shrinks outside of the united states economic conditions are changing at the start of 2019 china is clearly cooling down year over year real gdp growth fell to 6 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 the lowest since the great recession fortunately china has maneuvering room to increase fiscal stimulus we expect to see another substantial tax cut in 2019 and possibly an increase in local government borrowing in support of infrastructure projects designed to offset the drag on the export sector europe is also cooling independent of the uncertainty generated by a very clumsy brexit italy s troubled banks are vulnerable to a cooler european economy and disruption from a hard brexit the us corporate sector is vulnerable corporate profits have been strong but a tight labor market is pushing up wages and higher wages will eat into profits at the same time both interest rates and trade tariffs have increased corporate balance sheets are strong enough to tolerate some margin compression but eventually profits will get squeezed and investors will get anxious at the same time corporate debt quality continues to erode while leverage is increasing the above mentioned risk factors threaten two key parts of the us economy the housing sector has been particularly subdued in this expansion cycle often thought of as an accelerator for the us economy residential investment was a brake on the us economy through the second half of 2018 home sales have proven to be very sensitive to even relatively small increases in mortgage rates housing affordability remains a key issue for many first time homebuyers particularly those saddled with heavy student debt loads business investment has also been subdued in this expansion cycle it is fair to say that the current economic expansion was largely fueled by the reabsorption of labor rather than investment in productivity enhancing processes now as the availability of quality labor shrinks businesses will need to invest in new technologies in order to expand output in the first half of 2018 business fixed investment responded positively to corporate tax reform however in the third quarter of 2018 growth in business fixed investment fell noticeably down to a 2 5 percent annual rate it will be very telling to see if business investment picks up again in early 2019 or if it tails offs the increasing vulnerability of the us economy to recession has serious implications for all of the americas this was evident during the great recession of 2007 09 when all major western hemisphere economies went into recession the linkages were not only through direct trade but also through capital markets which dried up globally key measures of correlation between the united states and other western hemisphere economies can fluctuate over time so it is important to ask is the relationship between economic growth in the us and economic growth in the western hemisphere during the current expansion fundamentally different from that observed during the last expansion to answer this question we have analyzed the relationship between economic growth in the us and the six largest economies of the western hemisphere brazil canada mexico argentina colombia and chile by exploring co movements among their real gdp growth rates we used the organisation for economic co operation and development s oecd s reported quarterly figures for seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product in order to see how the co movements between economies have changed over the last business cycle we calculated correlation coefficients for economic growth between the us and the six major economies across three distinct time periods 1 pre recession period 2004q1 to 2007q4 16 quarters 2 the great recession 2008q1 to 2009q2 6 quarters 3 post recession period 2009q3 to 2018q2 36 quarters figure 1 below shows the annualized changes in quarterly real gdp for the us and a simple average of the six largest economies the graph also includes an interpolation of the oecd s annual real gdp growth forecasts from november 2018 figure 1 economic growth in the us and the six largest economies in the americas we see that gdp growth rates between the us and the six largest economies were not highly correlated in the pre recession period from 2004q1 to 2007q4 during the great recession correlation increased unfortunately the strong correlation pulled the other economies into the us led recession during the post recession period beginning in 2009q3 correlations were generally stronger than they were before the recession figure 2 shows the correlation coefficient between quarterly changes in us real gdp and a simple average of the same measure for the six largest economies in the western hemisphere on a 3 year 12 quarter rolling basis figure 2 co movement between the us and the six largest economies in the americas averages we see that the three historical periods are quite distinct correlations between economic growth in the us and the rest of the western hemisphere were generally moderately negative during the pre recession period strongly positive during the great recession and moderately to weakly positive during the post recession period although thecorrelation coefficients themselves were not particularly strong during the post recessionary expansion it is important to note that they moved from negative to consistently positive of course individual countries performed differently figure 3 shows the correlation of us gdp growth with six other countries canada mexico brazil argentina colombia and chile figure 3 co movement between the us and the six largest economies in the americas in figure 3 the overall pattern holds but we can see that individual countries behaved differently during the pre recession period most countries were negatively correlated with us gdp growth however chile was an exception to the rule showing moderate positive correlation with us gdp growth countries were tightly grouped during the great recession much to their detriment in the early post recession period canada and brazil stood with moderate negative correlations to the us later in the post recession period most countries were positively correlated with the us with the exception of mexico economic structure internal policy foreign exchange and us policy all played a role in shaping each country s individual co movement graph conclusions early in 2019 it looks as if downside risk factors are piling up for the us economy our data analysis suggests that other western hemisphere economies are vulnerable if the us economy slips into recession over the next year or two that much is common sense what may be less understood is that economic growth in western hemisphere economies is generally more correlated with us economic growth now than it was prior to the great recession this suggests that the global dynamics of the next recession will be different we may be in for a counter intuitive situation in which a shallower us recession could cause more economic stress than expected in other countries

the global economic and investment outlook reversed in just six months prior to october stocks in the united states and elsewhere were leaping the u s federal reserve and the bank of canada were raising their benchmark interest rates in anticipation of economic overheating while the european central bank had ended its bond buying stimulus program and was considering raising rates the federal reserve also worried about tight labour markets rekindling serious inflation even though none was evident but then the s p 500 index peaked on oct 3 before plummeting almost 20 per cent to its christmas eve low as evidence of worldwide economic slowdown mounted still the u s central bank raised its interest rate again on dec 19 and continued the run off of its massive portfolio in late january however the scales fell from the fed s eyes and it announced a pause fed chairman jerome powell in late february said with our policy rate in the range of neutral with muted inflation pressures and with some downside risks we ve talked about this is a good time to be patient with the fed s pause equity investors yelled all clear and jumped back into equities but their recent rise is probably a bear market rally obviously to make such a dramatic and sudden policy shift the fed must be very worried about the downside another clue the yield on the 10 year treasury note has dropped from 3 2 per cent in early november to 2 5 per cent maybe part of that decline is investor relief spawned by the fed s pause but it also suggests even lower inflation ahead weak credit demand and a recession even more so for the yield on the 30 year treasury bond which fell from 3 5 per cent to 2 9 per cent the fed recently cut its inflation forecast and mr powell said it s one of the major challenges of our time to have downward pressure on inflation globally ten years in this expansion and inflation is still not clearly meeting our target contrary to the fed i ve been warning of a recession and possible deflation since march 2018 when i first discussed the growing evidence in our monthly insight report i see a two thirds possibility of a u s business downturn starting this year and which will probably be global it may have already started in the first quarter but given the long lags in data reporting and revisions it will be several quarters before the situation is clear the forerunners of a recession are legion beyond the earlier weakness in stocks with the fed on hold the decline in the 10 year treasury note yield pushed it in late march to below that of three month treasury bills this yield curve inversion the reverse of the normal spread has consistently signalled past recessions also dampening business and consumer spending is uncertainty over the not yet finalized new trade deal between canada the united states and mexico and the trade war between the united states and china the international monetary fund and world bank continue to cut their forecasts for economic growth in major countries and for the total world the combined leading indicators for the 33 major economies including canada continue to slide with the year over year decline in december the biggest since july 2009 during the global great recession i see a one third likelihood of a soft landing in which the fed shifts from credit tightening to easing without a business downturn by my count that happened only once in the mid 1990s out of 13 attempts by the u s central bank to cool off what it saw as an overheating economy further reducing the odds of a soft landing the fed s liquidation of its massive assets if economic growth revives later this year the recession will probably only be postponed until 2020 the fed would resume raising interest rates since it wants more room to cut them in the next recession weak economic growth for the first quarter is widely expected but if it continues that spells recession as usual in a business downturn stock prices will fall much more than the economy also equities are expensive in relation to earnings and props such as big stock buybacks will dry up still i don t see big imbalances that just beg for huge corrections that will devastate stocks nothing like the subprime mortgage debacle in the 2000s that spawned the deepest recession since the 1930 and a 57 per cent peak to trough plunge in the s p 500 nothing like the 2000 busting of the dot com bubble that took the tech heavy nasdaq index down a whopping 78 per cent and nothing like the severe 1973 75 recession that resulted from the collapse in inflation hedge buying of excess inventories and deflated the s p 500 by 48 per cent an average recessionary decline in equities is more likely which would take the s p 500 down 21 per cent from its oct 3 peak to 2 340 not much below its christmas eve low of 2 351 but still a decline of 17 per cent from its recent level still the risks are on the downside in portfolios i manage we are emphasizing

briefing highlights vancouver toronto housing outlook stocks loonie oil at a glance housing starts rise permits slip brexit in spotlight again what to expect from ecb this week what else to watch for this week required reading buying or selling potential home buyers and sellers in vancouver and toronto might want to hear what royal bank of canada has to say for the record rbc senior economist robert hogue isn t giving advice to wannabe home owners but his latest outlook for the vancouver and toronto housing markets may be well worth the read first vancouver where resales fell in march to their lowest level in more than three decades while prices continued to decline very weak market conditions got even weaker in vancouver where policy measures introduced by all levels of government in the past couple of years continue to keep buyers disinterested or discouraged mr hogue said in his report and here s a key bit if the reason why vancouver buyers are staying on the sidelines is that they re waiting for more significant price breaks that could well be what s coming we expect property values to remain under intense downward pressure in the near term in toronto the latest report from the local real estate board showed sales were flat in march compared to a year earlier and benchmark prices rose 2 6 per cent notable was that new listings declined by about 5 per cent as potential sellers held back and this lack of buying options may have played a role in the march softness this possible explanation finds some support in the fact that the benchmark price rose at a faster pace in march 2 6 per cent year over year than february 2 3 per cent suggesting that buyers had to bid more aggressively in the face of limited supply mr hogue said we expect more sellers to come out of the woodwork over the next few months as a slightly stronger negotiating position boosts their confidence he added given generally balanced demand supply conditions price increases are poised to stay in the low single digits in the near term in the toronto area read more markets at a glance read more ticker housing starts rise housing starts across canada perked up last month after

wednesday a big day for europe this with a european union summit and european central bank meeting it s set to be another seminal week for the eu and u k as we approach another brexit deadline said cmc chief market analyst michael hewson that deadline to leave the eu is friday though prime minister theresa may has asked for an extension to the end of june given that britain s parliament can t agree on anything open this photo in gallery prime minister theresa mayalastair grant the associated press the window for finding an agreement before april 12 is pretty much closed which means that an extension is the most likely outcome mr hewson said the ecb in turn is expected to make no change to monetary policy amid a deteriorating economic outlook but president draghi will have no choice but to give a downbeat assessment of the economic outlook which will probably set the stage for lower macroeconomic projections in june gabriella dickens and melanie debono of capital economics said in a lookahead to the decision in the united states investors will be watching for both the morning report on inflation and afternoon release of the minutes of the last meeting of the federal reserve economists expect the first report to show annual inflation picked up in march to 1 8 or 1 9 per cent from february s 1 5 per cent as for the minutes there has been a lot of chatter that the federal open market committee the u s central bank s policy setting panel could cut interest rates at some point so markets will be looking for any clues they can find we expect the minutes of last month s fomc meeting to underline that further rate hikes are off the table although any explicit discussion of rate cuts is still unlikely said andrew hunter of capital economics on the corporate front delta air lines inc reports quarterly results thursday the budget that everyone wants to see will be released after markets close the first full budget under the new ontario government is without a doubt the most hotly anticipated of the 2019 season said bank of montreal senior economist robert kavcic that s partly because ontario has one of the most challenging fiscal situations in canada at the moment and because the current government represents a complete u turn versus the prior government from a policy perspective that is promising spending restraint and tax relief he added we ve already seen a number of measures taken including scrapping of the cap and trade program and some modest taxation tweaks but it s most likely that the biggest election promises on the tax front will be reserved for years three and four of the mandate the big question mr kavcic added relates to when ontario expects to balance the budget friday jpmorgan chase co and wells fargo co kick off earnings among the major u s banks banks across the board are finding it difficult to maximize returns in the current low rate environment cmc s mr hewson said with missing profit estimates in its last quarter for the first time in 15 quarters and the recent announcement of job cuts in its asset and wealth management divisions this week could well see another disappointment he added as for wells fargo mr

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by dhara ranasinghe ritvik carvalho and abhinav ramnarayan london reuters just a month after the european central bank halted plans to normalize policy and delayed a rate increase into 2020 further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors is putting the central bank back in the spotlight related stories no policy changes are expected at wednesday s ecb meeting especially since some board members are traveling to washington for the international monetary fund s spring meetings but talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks global recession fears and a sense of alarm that pushed 10 year german bond yields below zero percent for the first time since 2016 suggest the ecb news conference may prove lively we look at five key questions on the radar for markets 1 how close is the ecb to action to offset the impact of negative interest rates on banks a debate on whether to tier the negative interest rates that banks pay on the idle cash they park at the ecb is now underway judging by recent ecb comments and the minutes from the march meeting it s not an obvious next step but one that the ecb will have to face at some point said james rossiter senior global strategist at td securities we don t expect anything official in the ecb s statement but it will be difficult for ecb chief mario draghi to avoid questions on this dutch central bank governor klaas knot has said he would need to see clear evidence that negative rates were hurting lending to the real economy ecb vice president luis de guindos said last week that while the bank is studying ways to cut its charge on banks deposits euro zone lenders should look closer to home for the causes of their meager profits the debate is important because if the ecb introduces tiered rates that might suggest it is preparing to keep interest rates low below zero percent for longer than anticipated no surprise then that money markets have scaled back expectations of a rate rise and even started to factor in the risk of a rate cut this year graphic when will the ecb raise interest rates 2 what about tltro iii can we expect more details in march the ecb offered some details of what tltro iii will look like the loans will have a two year maturity and be offered on a quarterly basis from september until march 2021 the ecb s march meeting minutes showed the bank is still ironing out details key questions for investors now are what interest the banks will have to pay on the loans and where the funds can be deployed barclays analysts for example expect banks will be given an incentive to take up the loans through better borrowing rates than the main refinancing operations mro which provide the bulk of liquidity to the euro zone banking system euro zone bank stocks and government bonds are sensitive to any tltro news yields on short dated southern european bonds have dropped suggesting investors expect italian banks in particular to take up the loans graphic euro zone bank stocks cheer signs of multi year loans 3 does the ecb see any green shoots for the economy the ecb is not expected to change its assessment that risks to the economy are tilted to the downside but officials are worried about the downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts unexpectedly weak manufacturing activity data from germany rattled markets last month and a brief inversion of the u s bond yield curve fueled concerns about global recession risks germany s leading economic institutes last week slashed their 2019 forecast for growth in europe s biggest economy and warned growth might be even lower if there is a no deal brexit not all the data have been bad and economists point out a pick up in data from china the world s number two economy and signs of strength from the euro zone services sector graphic euro zone economic data 4 how concerned is the ecb that ultra loose policy has failed to lift inflation expectations even after last month s unexpectedly dovish tone from the central bank inflation and inflation expectations remain low draghi has long predicted a rise in underlying inflation only for the data to disappoint him and force the ecb to ask for even more time to lift prices a closely watched underlying inflation figure that excludes volatile food and energy prices slowed to 1 0 percent in march its weakest reading since april 2018 economists note the timing of easter distorts the inflation numbers and that the april data should prove more encouraging it might not feel or look like it but inflation has been delayed rather than derailed said jefferies senior european economist marchel alexandrovich the ecb will be hoping that s the case especially since inflation expectations have tumbled a key market gauge of long term inflation expectations tracked by the ecb is near its lowest level since 2016 it is down 20 basis points this year more than it fell the whole of 2018 graphic below target inflation 5 is the ecb ready for a no deal brexit draghi told european union leaders recently that the ecb the bank of england and the european commission have made all the necessary preparations for a no deal brexit according to a recent report but draghi and other officials have also stressed that markets are not fully pricing in the risk of britain s exit from the eu without a deal a warning the ecb chief may repeat this week a no deal brexit might also affect market liquidity the eu commissioner in charge of financial services said last week any clarity on brexit is likely to be met with relief by investors and boost sentiment the ecb is no doubt paying close attention for an interactive version of the below chart click here

better than expected u s payrolls report and opec commitment to withhold around 1 2m bpd of supply this year however this morning s kick higher has come mostly from an escalation of fighting in libya

the two multilateral institutions attract power brokers from across the globe and plenty of criticism slowing global economic growth trade tensions rising inequality a planet in peril these challenges and some notable debuts will be on the agenda at this week s joint gathering of the international monetary fund imf and world bank in washington the semiannual event attracts power brokers finance ministers big money luminaries central bankers and media from around the world but the institutions which both mark their 75th anniversaries this year are also attracting critics who question their capacity to redress the global economy s most pressing problems the debuts tuesday former wall street executive and newly installed world bank group president david malpass will start his five year term the sole candidate for the job he was nominated by president donald trump in february and unanimously selected by the bank s executive board on friday 190405190958881 malpass s nomination to lead the development lender initially raised eyebrows he s expressed doubts in the past over multilateral cooperation and criticised the world bank for continuing to lend to china even as the country has grown wealthier president trump s climate scepticism also blatantly contradicts the bank s position on climate change which it characterises as an acute threat to global development and its efforts to end poverty tuesday also will see newly installed imf chief economist gita gopinath present the first world economic outlook weo produced on her watch appointed by imf managing director christine lagarde last fall gopinath is the first woman to lead the fund s research department in its seven decade history we expect continuity from previous weos torsten slok chief economist with deutsche bank told al jazeera the chapters are always interesting because they are always very well done and on top of that they reveal what policymakers are thinking about last week lagarde indicated the imf s forecasts for global growth would likely be further revised downward telling an audience at the us chamber of commerce in washington that the global economy is in a delicate moment 190402142223068 though lagarde said growth could improve in the second half of this year and early 2020 she warned that there are clear downside risks including the united kingdom s proposed exit from the european union high levels of global debt jittery financial markets and trade tensions the recent slowdown in global trade is already spreading pain to european and most asian economies the ongoing trade war is a very important topic not only because of its impact on the g7 countries but also because trade and trade policy is very important for emerging markets said slok last wednesday the imf released research forecasting the possible consequences of an escalation in the ongoing us china tit for tat trade dispute the imf warned that if the us and china were to increase tariffs by 25 percent on all goods flowing between the two countries both economies would suffer sizeable losses in manufacturing sustainability on the agenda this week s meetings in washington will spotlight sustainability development and the roles of both citizens and institutions in making progress towards the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs a global blueprint to work towards a more secure equitable and sustainable future 180907051253079 sustainability has come more to the forefront of conversations surrounding the imf rachel ziemba an adjunct senior fellow with the center for a new american security told al jazeera this year one key question will be whether or not the risks surrounding sustainability have been taken into account for future planning and for investors if it s being priced into any future forecasting she added but some believe the imf and world bank are taking the wrong approach to meet these challenges the imf in recent years has an exceptionally poor record thanks in good part to its disastrous engagement with greece said james galbraith a professor of economics at the university of texas during the global financial crisis the imf and the eurozone required greece to raise taxes and cut spending in exchange for a bailout package the painful austerity measures devastated the livelihoods of millions of ordinary greeks and hit young workers and pensioners especially hard the world bank has also come under fire for its maximizing finance for development agenda which helps private sector capital tap into developing markets 180831122553408 last year a group of 120 scholars signed an open letter criticising the world bank s approach arguing that it promotes the privatisation of public services and could usher in permanent austerity along the lines of privatising gains socialising losses what the world bank is encouraging countries to do is to transform their financial systems in a way that they can welcome global institutional investors said daniela gabor a professor of economics and macrofinance at uwe bristol and the lead signatory on the letter gabor argues that the world bank should help countries create an institutional infrastructure that orients the entire economy towards greener more sustainable development the world bank has not yet confronted the very serious question that you need structural change in the economies of the poorer countries that you re supporting in theory in order to achieve the sdgs gabor said
the euro will rebound from its worst start to a year since 2015 to gain over the coming 12 months according to a reuters poll of analysts although they warned that risks to that view were skewed to the downside having lost nearly 4 5 percent against the dollar in 2018 the euro has not fared any better so far this year falling more than 2 percent in january march its worst first quarter performance in four years that was mostly driven by weak growth and inflation prospects for the region which pushed the european central bank to rule out any rate hikes this year and announce new long term cheap loans known as tltros but the poll of more than 75 currency analysts taken this week showed the euro will reverse that trend and gain about 5 percent in a year to 1 18 from around 1 12 on thursday the single currency began to rise at the start of april on news that talks on trade between the united states and china appeared to be making headway while europe remains impacted by external trade concerns assuming an easing in china u s trade tensions into h2 and a resulting turn in external data we look for a stronger medium run euro profile said jeremy stretch head of g10 fx strategy at cibc capital markets the introduction of fresh tltros helps to alleviate a potential cliff in funding costs for euro zone banks while increased fiscal stimulus will also be supportive for the euro economic data out of the euro zone in recent weeks has given few reasons to be optimistic but the u s economy is also experiencing a slowdown which has forced the federal reserve to make a u turn on policy the fed s dot plot projections now suggest no hikes in 2019 compared with two predicted in december with economists in a separate reuters poll ruling out any tightening next year too we don t expect the ecb to be dynamic when it comes to interest rate hikes but we see an end to interest rate hikes in the u s so the momentum will turn sometime in the future in favour of the euro said dekabank economist christian melzer this survey marks the 20th consecutive poll in which analysts have predicted the euro will gain over the 12 month forecast horizon but during that period it has lost close to 5 percent against the dollar the latest consensus was the lowest since a poll in september 2017 and the range of forecasts showed lower lows for the single currency for the second survey in a row over 65 percent of analysts who answered an extra question said the risk to their euro forecasts for the coming year was skewed more to the downside there may be a little bit more downside to go on the euro to reflect the weakness of the euro zone economy the impact of political uncertainty also the more dovish bias of the ecb said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank however analysts were less clear about the dollar respondents were split right down the middle when asked if the risk to their dollar forecasts was skewed more to the upside or downside there s nothing like as much gloom yet about the u s as there is about europe so no wonder the euro is anchored firmly to the bottom of its trading range said kit juckes global head of fx strategy at societe generale if you re a u s economic pessimist who wants to be a dollar bear my best recommendation is that you go back into hibernation for a little longer although most major economies are expected to experience a protracted economic slowdown the united states is likely to be relatively stable which should keep the dollar in play we are in the battle of uglies now when it comes to fundamentals and the dollar is probably just the least ugly said rabobank s foley source reuters polling by indradip ghosh and mumal rathore editing by catherine evans
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by dhara ranasinghe ritvik carvalho and abhinav ramnarayan london reuters just a month after the european central bank halted plans to normalize policy and delayed a rate increase into 2020 further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors is putting the central bank back in the spotlight related stories no policy changes are expected at wednesday s ecb meeting especially since some board members are traveling to washington for the international monetary fund s spring meetings but talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks global recession fears and a sense of alarm that pushed 10 year german bond yields below zero percent for the first time since 2016 suggest the ecb news conference may prove lively we look at five key questions on the radar for markets 1 how close is the ecb to action to offset the impact of negative interest rates on banks a debate on whether to tier the negative interest rates that banks pay on the idle cash they park at the ecb is now underway judging by recent ecb comments and the minutes from the march meeting it s not an obvious next step but one that the ecb will have to face at some point said james rossiter senior global strategist at td securities we don t expect anything official in the ecb s statement but it will be difficult for ecb chief mario draghi to avoid questions on this dutch central bank governor klaas knot has said he would need to see clear evidence that negative rates were hurting lending to the real economy ecb vice president luis de guindos said last week that while the bank is studying ways to cut its charge on banks deposits euro zone lenders should look closer to home for the causes of their meager profits the debate is important because if the ecb introduces tiered rates that might suggest it is preparing to keep interest rates low below zero percent for longer than anticipated no surprise then that money markets have scaled back expectations of a rate rise and even started to factor in the risk of a rate cut this year graphic when will the ecb raise interest rates 2 what about tltro iii can we expect more details in march the ecb offered some details of what tltro iii will look like the loans will have a two year maturity and be offered on a quarterly basis from september until march 2021 the ecb s march meeting minutes showed the bank is still ironing out details key questions for investors now are what interest the banks will have to pay on the loans and where the funds can be deployed barclays analysts for example expect banks will be given an incentive to take up the loans through better borrowing rates than the main refinancing operations mro which provide the bulk of liquidity to the euro zone banking system euro zone bank stocks and government bonds are sensitive to any tltro news yields on short dated southern european bonds have dropped suggesting investors expect italian banks in particular to take up the loans graphic euro zone bank stocks cheer signs of multi year loans 3 does the ecb see any green shoots for the economy the ecb is not expected to change its assessment that risks to the economy are tilted to the downside but officials are worried about the downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts unexpectedly weak manufacturing activity data from germany rattled markets last month and a brief inversion of the u s bond yield curve fueled concerns about global recession risks germany s leading economic institutes last week slashed their 2019 forecast for growth in europe s biggest economy and warned growth might be even lower if there is a no deal brexit not all the data have been bad and economists point out a pick up in data from china the world s number two economy and signs of strength from the euro zone services sector graphic euro zone economic data 4 how concerned is the ecb that ultra loose policy has failed to lift inflation expectations even after last month s unexpectedly dovish tone from the central bank inflation and inflation expectations remain low draghi has long predicted a rise in underlying inflation only for the data to disappoint him and force the ecb to ask for even more time to lift prices a closely watched underlying inflation figure that excludes volatile food and energy prices slowed to 1 0 percent in march its weakest reading since april 2018 economists note the timing of easter distorts the inflation numbers and that the april data should prove more encouraging it might not feel or look like it but inflation has been delayed rather than derailed said jefferies senior european economist marchel alexandrovich the ecb will be hoping that s the case especially since inflation expectations have tumbled a key market gauge of long term inflation expectations tracked by the ecb is near its lowest level since 2016 it is down 20 basis points this year more than it fell the whole of 2018 graphic below target inflation 5 is the ecb ready for a no deal brexit draghi told european union leaders recently that the ecb the bank of england and the european commission have made all the necessary preparations for a no deal brexit according to a recent report but draghi and other officials have also stressed that markets are not fully pricing in the risk of britain s exit from the eu without a deal a warning the ecb chief may repeat this week a no deal brexit might also affect market liquidity the eu commissioner in charge of financial services said

recently wall street has been myopically focused on the ipo of a ride sharing company called lyft which by the way is hemorrhaging money since investors have become much less concerned about profits and valuations this offering was an incredible 20 times oversubscribed meaning the underwriters received 47 billion of orders for lyft shares but raised 2 3 billion the company generated 2 billion in revenue last year and lost an incredible 911 billion investors rewarded this profligate business model with a market cap of 27 billion this is a great example that wall street has gone nuts the lyft ipo price was 72 per share and shot up to 88 60 on its first day of trading but the following trading day those shares were down 24 from the high indeed this is emblematic of the dead canary in wall street s coal mine wall street s mispricing of this ipo is a perfect illustration of how the yield suppression from central banks has caused another stock market mania the lyft ipo should provide prudent investors with a stark warning it is crucial to ignore the lure of lemmings and groupthink rather they should concentrate on the fundamentals and the data both of which point to a massive equity bubble recent data points prove that the us and the global economy are weak at best and cannot support the stock market at this level the commerce department said recently that retail sales fell 0 2 percent in february over the past year retail sales increased by a slight 2 2 hence after adjusting for inflation growth in retail sales was not evident at all durable goods orders for february fell 1 6 a key measure of business investment known as core capital goods orders fell for the fifth time in the last seven dropping 0 1 you can forget about the capital spending boom and productivity gains hoped for from the tax cut ex autos and gas the number was 0 6 vs 0 3 expectations spiking prices at the pump boosted the headline retail sales number but didn t help most consumers wallets the chicago pmi in march slowed to a reading of 58 7 from 64 7 order backlogs fell into contraction territory while production and new orders fell from the previous month s level remember march data is hugely important because those readings occurred after the government reopened at should show a strong rebound if not the economy is in deep trouble the march ism services sector pmi which fell to 56 1 was the weakest print since august 2017 and down from 59 7 in february the us automotive sector is giving us another warning sign about consumers health fiat chrysler reported a 3 decrease in u s auto sales for the first quarter of 2019 while general motors sales fell 7 in the first quarter as all four of its brands recorded losses toyota motor corp reported a 3 5 fall in u s sales in march and a 5 drop for the first quarter nissan motor co posted a 5 3 drop in sales in march and its first quarter sales were down a significant 11 6 the economic slowdown is even worse in europe factories in the eurozone had their worst month for almost six years in march the eu s ihs markit s march final manufacturing purchasing managers index declined for an eighth month coming in at 47 5 from february s 49 3 china s march pmi improved to 50 8 which is barely in expansion mode however wall street ignored the horrific eu data in favor of the hopes that china can bounce back but the truth is red china is a debt disabled nation with a shrinking labor force and falling productivity china s household debt increased by 716 non financial corporate debt jumped by 400 and total government debt climbed by 416 all since 2008 this was the product of its past stimulus packages it is extremely doubtful that robust and viable growth can be produced from yet another round of government stimulus turning back to the us the data does not indicate the real estate sector will be aiding to the hopes of a second half rebound in the economy february made it 14 straight months of year over year declines in pending home sales the drop in pending sales was down 4 9 from january the takeaway is clear home prices have shot up well above incomes each year since 2012 due to fed s zirp now home prices have become unaffordable for the first time buyer for the most part even though mortgage rates are coming down perhaps that is why we are starting to see the inexorable rise in home prices begin to reverse the median sales price of a new home in february fell 3 6 to 315 300 the home price income ratio now stands at 4 4 it ranged from 3 3 5 from 1969 2001 and hit an all time of 5 1 in 2005 manhattan real estate sales fell for the 6th quarter in a row that is the longest losing streak in the past 30 years interest rates are falling commensurately with decelerating economic growth demand is down for homeownership due to affordability issues and at the same time banks are less incentivized to lend due to shrinking margins on new loans the yield curve inverted recently and that inversion has led to a recession seven out of the last seven times it has occurred the most salient question is whether or not china s massive stimulus efforts combined with the fed s abeyance with rate hikes and promise to end qt come october will be enough to provide for viable global growth with all this there are some small signs of stable data in the us for example the march ism manufacturing index registering 55 3 in from 54 2 in february which was a small increase but that slight blip higher in the ism was offset by the ihs markit manufacturing pmi which fell to 52 4 vs 53 in february which the lowest reading since june 2017 the plain truth is the overwhelming majority of global data still points towards contraction and an anemic debt disabled world there is a contraction in global trade the baltic dry index has crashed tax receipts are falling and according to factset there was the largest cut to q1 s p 500 eps estimates since q1 2016 eps was cut by 7 2 to 37 33 the interesting part is that for all of last year the earnings for the s p 500 was 161 57 the projection for 2019 eps is 168 19 or 4 growth however with q1 projected to post just 37 33 it will take an absolute surge in global gdp and eps to achieve anything close to that 2019 estimate the current run rate 2019 for full year eps on the s p is below 150 therefore the global equity market has priced in the environment that a return to a globally synchronized recovery is indeed already an established fact nearly every economist and market strategist is bullish predicting a favorable outcome to brexit the trade wars the slowdown in global gdp the current recession in parts of europe the zero growth in japan us gdp growth slowing from 4 2 last year to 1 3 in q1 which is projected by the ny fed they see no issues at all with record global debt levels and the 10 trillion worth of negative yielding sovereign bonds there is no fear over the threat from donald trump to close the southern border or trump imposing tariffs on autos from the eu the level of complacency is astonishing only the tech bubble of 1999 can compare with the lunacy that wall street exhibits today therefore the only logical outcome is that disappointment lies ahead for the perma bulls a big drop in the stock market is inevitable that collapse in asset prices will set the fed up for a massive move back to zirp and qe along with fiscal spending that would make even alexandria ocasio cortez blush which will render the economy into a deep battle with stagflation that stagflation will lead to some great opportunities on the long side but will also eventually set us up for a huge plunge in asset prices that will make q4 of 2018 and 2008 look like a bull market such are the consequences derived from abrogating the free market in favor of the hubris of central planners

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by dhara ranasinghe ritvik carvalho and abhinav ramnarayan london reuters just a month after the european central bank halted plans to normalize policy and delayed a rate increase into 2020 further signs of weakness in the economy and a whiff of panic among investors is putting the central bank back in the spotlight related stories no policy changes are expected at wednesday s ecb meeting especially since some board members are traveling to washington for the international monetary fund s spring meetings but talk of tiered rates to ease pressure on banks global recession fears and a sense of alarm that pushed 10 year german bond yields below zero percent for the first time since 2016 suggest the ecb news conference may prove lively we look at five key questions on the radar for markets 1 how close is the ecb to action to offset the impact of negative interest rates on banks a debate on whether to tier the negative interest rates that banks pay on the idle cash they park at the ecb is now underway judging by recent ecb comments and the minutes from the march meeting it s not an obvious next step but one that the ecb will have to face at some point said james rossiter senior global strategist at td securities we don t expect anything official in the ecb s statement but it will be difficult for ecb chief mario draghi to avoid questions on this dutch central bank governor klaas knot has said he would need to see clear evidence that negative rates were hurting lending to the real economy ecb vice president luis de guindos said last week that while the bank is studying ways to cut its charge on banks deposits euro zone lenders should look closer to home for the causes of their meager profits the debate is important because if the ecb introduces tiered rates that might suggest it is preparing to keep interest rates low below zero percent for longer than anticipated no surprise then that money markets have scaled back expectations of a rate rise and even started to factor in the risk of a rate cut this year graphic when will the ecb raise interest rates 2 what about tltro iii can we expect more details in march the ecb offered some details of what tltro iii will look like the loans will have a two year maturity and be offered on a quarterly basis from september until march 2021 the ecb s march meeting minutes showed the bank is still ironing out details key questions for investors now are what interest the banks will have to pay on the loans and where the funds can be deployed barclays analysts for example expect banks will be given an incentive to take up the loans through better borrowing rates than the main refinancing operations mro which provide the bulk of liquidity to the euro zone banking system euro zone bank stocks and government bonds are sensitive to any tltro news yields on short dated southern european bonds have dropped suggesting investors expect italian banks in particular to take up the loans graphic euro zone bank stocks cheer signs of multi year loans 3 does the ecb see any green shoots for the economy the ecb is not expected to change its assessment that risks to the economy are tilted to the downside but officials are worried about the downside risks to the growth and inflation forecasts unexpectedly weak manufacturing activity data from germany rattled markets last month and a brief inversion of the u s bond yield curve fueled concerns about global recession risks germany s leading economic institutes last week slashed their 2019 forecast for growth in europe s biggest economy and warned growth might be even lower if there is a no deal brexit not all the data have been bad and economists point out a pick up in data from china the world s number two economy and signs of strength from the euro zone services sector graphic euro zone economic data 4 how concerned is the ecb that ultra loose policy has failed to lift inflation expectations even after last month s unexpectedly dovish tone from the central bank inflation and inflation expectations remain low draghi has long predicted a rise in underlying inflation only for the data to disappoint him and force the ecb to ask for even more time to lift prices a closely watched underlying inflation figure that excludes volatile food and energy prices slowed to 1 0 percent in march its weakest reading since april 2018 economists note the timing of easter distorts the inflation numbers and that the april data should prove more encouraging it might not feel or look like it but inflation has been delayed rather than derailed said jefferies senior european economist marchel alexandrovich the ecb will be hoping that s the case especially since inflation expectations have tumbled a key market gauge of long term inflation expectations tracked by the ecb is near its lowest level since 2016 it is down 20 basis points this year more than it fell the whole of 2018 graphic below target inflation 5 is the ecb ready for a no deal brexit draghi told european union leaders recently that the ecb the bank of england and the european commission have made all the necessary preparations for a no deal brexit according to a recent report but draghi and other officials have also stressed that markets are not fully pricing in the risk of britain s exit from the eu without a deal a warning the ecb chief may repeat this week a no deal brexit might also affect market liquidity the eu commissioner in charge of financial services said

why labour ops won t embrace tax increase the national assembly has just passed the bill to increase the national minimum wage from n18 000 to n30 000 the federal government is believed to be planning to increase the value added tax vat to enable it pay though the nation s tax chief may have denied any such plans labour and members of the organised private sector ops keep warning against it they are also cautioning that any tax increase will erode the gains of the new wage regime particularly for the low income workers toba agboola reports the federal government and organised labour appear to be on a collision course if and when implemented the government s proposed plan to increase value added tax vat to enable it pay the new n30 000 national minimum wage approved by the national assembly will likely pit it against labour and members of the organised private sector ops to the labour movement the ops and indeed other nigerians opposed to the proposed plan the vat upward review or any form of tax to fund the new wage regime will have far reaching effects on workers manufacturers businesses and consumers alike the federal government may have inadvertently set the stage for another round of confrontation with organised labour and civil society when it muted the idea of increasing the vat rate to accommodate the new n30 000 minimum wage the minister of budget and national planning senator udo udoma and the chairman of the federal inland revenue service firs mr babatunde fowler made the intention known to nigerians when they appeared before the senate committee on finance recently fowler said for instance the proposed payable vat by nigerians based on the increment from the current five per cent would actually be between 35 per cent 6 75 per cent and 50 per cent 7 25 per cent his words by the end of this year we should be ready for an increase in vat i can certainly see an increase in vat of at least 35 per cent to 50 per cent this year based on our enforcement activities the tax chief even sought to justify the proposed increment his words a lot of nigerians travel to ghana and other west african countries and they can see that theirs is much higher they pay when they go for those trips we should be ready for an increase in vat he also said there would be an increase in company income tax and also on petroleum profit tax he said the agency had increased vat collection by 25 per cent in the last three years but lamented that many of the firms that are collecting vat are not remitting it however fowler has since distanced himself from the comments purporting to have conveyed government s plans to increase vat and other taxes that was when labour the ops and other concerned nigerians vehemently opposed to an upward review of tax turned the heat on him despite the denial labour and the ops wasted no time in asking the federal government to pull the brakes on any proposed plan to increase taxes they even called on the government to exempt the new minimum wage from taxation neca nlc lcci others disagree the nigeria employers consultative association neca did not mince words when it said the review of vat or any form of tax as being proposed was capable of eroding the gains of the new minimum wage for low income earners and further weaken their purchasing power among other unsavoury consequences neca s director general mr timothy olawale said the planned increase of taxes would have far reaching implications for manufacturers businesses and consumers alike manufacturers and businesses are already saddled with several challenges such as infrastructural decay power among others some companies are closing shops due to some of these challenges while others are still struggling to stay afloat he pointed out olawale added that the proposed vat increase would definitely lead to an increase in the cost of doing business and would likely be passed to the consumers whose purchasing power is already weak as far as olawale is concerned increase in vat is not desirable at this time government does not have to increase vat or any tax in order to enable it pay minimum wage he said he however said in the event that government must increase vat against the will of the people it should be limited to luxury or ostentatious goods only olawale faulted the comparison of vat rates with other countries as being irrelevant due to the fact that business operating conditions in those climes are more clement than what obtains in nigeria as a way out the neca boss recommended that there should be more individual and corporate entities captured in the tax net paying vat he also advocated that the government should reduce its recurrent expenditure cost of governance widen the tax net in its bid to generate more revenue and ensure effective collection of taxes from non compliant citizens or defaulters he urged that government should not burden businesses with taxes rather it should create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive and continue to contribute to the growth of the nation neca which is the umbrella body for the ops and the voice of business in nigeria also urged the government not to burden businesses with taxes but create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive and continue to contribute to the growth of the nation lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci director general mr muda yusuf aligned with olawale he said the plan would not be good for business as investors are operating in a very difficult environment with high cost of production this is coupled with the fact that consumers purchasing power has further been worsened yusuf added he further pointed out that the unfortunate thing about vat in nigeria is that it goes on all services right from the ports where the raw materials come in to all the processing levels unlike in other economies where vat is on the final production the lcci boss stated that the way tax is operated in nigeria is different from the way it is operated in other countries adding that it is not favourable to the average man on the street yusuf added that taxation is about creating an environment that allows the rich to support the poor noting that this same principle could be extended to micro enterprises in the economy such category of business owners should also enjoy tax exemption he said arguing that a minimum wage of n30 000 is not too much to be paid to the lowest worker of an organisation whether in the public or private sector taking into account the cost of living in the country yusuf explained let us take a scenario of a family man that has to pay school fees for his children provide feeding for the family pay for health care pay for transportation pay house rent and possibly even support some dependants a monthly income of n30 000 certainly cannot cover these basic responsibilities it is therefore even worse when we talk about n18 000 minimum wage he however said the challenge with many of the states is that they have a workforce that is very unwieldy and not sustainable there is also the problem of too many political appointees on the payroll of many of the state governments yusuf said national union of textile garment and tailoring workers of nigeria nutgtwn general secretary comrade issa aremu said there is a twin assault on the real income of nigerian workers caused by unrestrained devaluation of the naira and the high rate of inflation aremu told the nation that it was important to put pressure on the firs to raise the tax bar in such a way that the n30 000 minimum wage would fall below taxable income he also made case for tax holidays for some categories of nigerian workers the labour leader said now that we have raised the minimum wage to n30 000 we must impress it on the firs to raise the tax bar so that the new minimum wage will be protected if you tax the n30 000 minimum wage we may as well go back to renegotiation aremu insisted that labour must push the agenda to protect the new minimum wage a point which he said was earlier raised by the deputy speaker of the house of representatives yusuf sulaiman lasun the n30 000 is actually a compromised amount from the n56 000 earlier proposed so it must be protected if the federal government can give 10 year tax holiday to companies why not give the same to workers given the collapse of income today nigerian workers deserve tax holidays aremu said according to him workers are not asking for this because they consider their job as charitable what workers have in their pocket is what will turn the economy around that is what we will use to purchase goods in the market and pay rent he clarified the labour unionist also pointed out that for the economy to recover it is good for workers to have sustainable purchasing power or disposable income that is off the tax hook his counterpart at nlc peter ozo eson agreed with him he said the income tax law needed to be amended to protect workers purchasing power given that the n30 000 labour agreed as a compromised minimum wage is so low ideally it should not be taxed but i believe that the correct way to do it is to amend the income tax law in order to raise the exemption bar if the n30 000 will fall within the law should be amended to ensure that the minimum wage level is below the taxable income under the present law if you earn n18 000 a month your tax is zero there is a tax table but with n30 000 under the existing exemption guideline there will be some little tax because it will be slightly above the exemption tax what needs to be done is to have an adjustment to the schedule so that the exemption is placed above the minimum wage he said it is easy to see why labour is spoiling for war over the proposed tax increase for one labour believes that the value of the n30 000 new minimum wage for which it literarily fought the government to a standstill may be badly hit when subjected to the monthly deduction tax of pay as you earn paye expected from all workers such fear and the subsequent agitation for exemption are not without basis recall that in 2011 when the current wage of n18 000 was approved as the national minimum wage workers in that earning bracket were exempted from paying tax as the deduction would have further reduced the wage beneath n18 000 for instance comparing the contentious n30 000 which is an equivalent of 83 with the 11 dollar minimum wage in america shows that at least a paid worker in america will earn in a day what a nigerian worker is struggling to earn in a month in the same analysis a worker in indonesia earns 100 as minimum wage but unlike nigeria where the social safety net is not working in indonesia the worker s salary is not expended on health education while gas transport are heavily subsidised and food is very cheap and affordable but the opposite is the case in nigeria and this was why organised labour called for tax exemption on the proposed new wage in order not to put further pressure on it and thereby make the wage increase irrelevant indeed nigerian workers by their present earning are presently considered among the poorest in the world nlc president ayuba wabba said with the falling value of the naira workers were forced to insist that the minimum wage must be upwardly reviewed when we signed the 18 000 minimum wage it was equivalent to 150 today 18 000 is less than 50 he said the association of senior civil servants of nigeria ascsn also noted that nigeria has become the poorest country in the world it regretted that nigerian workers are the least paid in africa despite enormous petroleum resources that have allegedly continued to be siphoned into private pockets by the political elite for instance nigeria national minimum wage stands at 50 per month while that of libya is 325 algeria 155 chad 110 morocco 310 south africa 232 seychelles 304 etc the union said the obvious pay disparity between nigerian workers and their counterparts in other countries was not lost on the national assembly though this was why house of representatives speaker yakubu dogara while passing the bill at the lower chamber said n30 000 as national minimum wage was not enough to sustain nigerian families he said a living wage was aptly appropriate for nigerian workers rather than a national minimum wage because of the country s harsh economic reality noting that there were obvious reasons why the house had to give accelerated consideration to the very crucial bill it is a bill that is long overdue as the current national minimum wage which was fixed in 2011 has become unrealistic due to supervening developments in the nation dogara said noting that since underemployment and unemployment were poverty strange bedfellows eliminating them must be the focal point of government s policies the n30 000 monthly national minimum wage which has now become a subject of fresh controversy over plans to hike taxes to enable government pay was recommended by the tripartite committee after extensive consultations and deliberations including touring of the six geo political zones of the country before it arrived at this must have been why financial derivatives limited managing director and chief executive officer ceo mr bismark rewane said the comments by the duo of udoma and fowler remained their opinions he said not until a white paper on the n30 000 minimum wage is available all submissions on the workable framework towards the implementation of the minimum wage still remains in the realm of speculations rewane however pointed out that nigeria s tax to gdp ratio was very low adding that for now he does not know which tax the country would be more efficient in collecting the economist admitted that discussions around nigeria s tax system must be looked at closely on his part the head of tax and corporate advisory services at pwc nigeria mr taiwo oyedele lamented that governments sometimes have a lazy approach to tackling problems without caring to know the impact on the citizenry oyedele said increasing vat or any other tax to enable government pay the n30 000 minimum wage in the face of unemployment fragile economic growth and low purchasing power would be counter productive he maintained that if government is compelled to increase the minimum wage then it should be looking at ways of improving efficiency and productivity the tax expert warned that increasing vat could lead to a decline in collection rate because majority of the people that are meant to be paying the current vat rate are not even paying adding that a further hike will discourage them further we currently have a five per cent vat rate that majority of the people that are supposed to be paying are not paying when you now increase it you would have succeeded in making the business environment less competitive for the people doing the right thing the people who are doing the wrong thing by not paying even have more incentives not to pay this overall is not even good for the economy oyedele said on how to arrive at a sustainable model of paying the minimum wage oyedele advocated the streamlining of job roles and a performance measurement framework across all ministries departments and agencies mdas appraisal model that would help shrink job roles but according to the ceo highcap securities david adonri the proposed increase in vat if implemented in the capital market will increase the cost of transactions on the domestic bourse and this will be a dis incentive to nigerians investing in the capital market will government heed the experts wise counsel will the agitation by labour ops and civil society force down the hand of the government and halt the proposed tax increase these questions are necessary in view of the argument by the secretary general of the association of senior civil servants of nigeria ascsn comrade alade bashir lawal that the government could pay workers the agreed n30 000 minimum wage without looking for funds according to lawal the government generates huge funds from the customs stamp duty payment vat treasury single account and many other sources the firs said it recorded n5 4 trillion in 2018 and is targeting about n8 trillion in 2019 these are revenue sources which can enable the government pay the minimum wage lawal said it was sad that there were leakages through taxes which was the traditional revenue source of government at all levels he noted that the federal government can pay the minimum wage within the resources it has

by globalists the end of empire and the birth of neoliberalism quinn slobodian cambridge harvard university press 2018 quinn slobodian s masterful exegesis an old term befitting his subject tells of the ur group of thinkers who formulated the assumptions and prescriptions of global neoliberalism he names this group the geneva school as distinct from the chicago school he suggests that their early attentiveness to the global level came from central europe s dependence on foreign trade and external markets unlike the united states at that time the original source material suggests that they were motivated by considerable anxiety following the collapse of the austro hungarian empire for them the empire was a supranational order of efficient and stable security they saw chaos coming from demands for redistribution preferential treatment and self determination by the masses in his introduction slobodian corrects erroneous assumptions about neoliberal theory they didn t believe in self regulating markets as autonomous entities they did not see democracy and capitalism as synonymous and they did not see people as motivated only by economic rationality the geneva school sought to safeguard capitalism at the scale of the entire globe to protect competition and capital against the threat of irrational human behavior neoliberalism arose after world war i at a time of crumbling empires when a number intellectuals grappled with how to balance state power and economic interdependence the geneva school solution was double government global jurisdiction for capital with the nation state encasing capital from encroachment by particular interests the league of nations founded after world war i and located in geneva had set about to reorder european states and their former imperial possessions they believed that the one determinant of global stability was the unimpeded flow of capital and that politics and economics needed to be distinct for example most geneva school neoliberals opposed south african apartheid and hayek was unambiguous in his public denunciation of apartheid yet he had even stronger words for attempts by international organizations to use sanctions and embargoes against south africa fascism looked promising to some until it raised tariff walls hayek was opposed to criticizing chile under pinochet they saw three ruptures to the world economy in the 20th century each accompanied by the democratization of the world world war i when nations ceased to uphold the gold standard and blurred the distinction between the economy and politics the 1929 great depression and the revolt of the global south starting in the 1970s with the declaration of a new international economic order nieo in principle the geneva school opposed state autonomy they saw the european economic community as a potential model for a world of constitutions while they opposed its protective measures and its most favored trade arrangements with former african colonies their core value is not freedom of the individual but the interdependence of the whole the depression and suspension of the gold standard generated efforts by economists to research the global economy and stave off future crises they focused on statistical data and measurement aiming to control the business cycle and to permanently prevent economic collapse the geneva neoliberals especially hayek concluded that the economy was unknowable and they redirected their attention to cultural and social bonds tradition and the rule of law which in itself was disintegrating in the 1930s hayek saw the world economy as sublime beyond human comprehension stability was to come through order ordo at the national and global levels through laws and institutions the 1938 walter lippmann colloquium in paris sought to create a new liberalism that would protect trade and capital movement between nations they differed with keynes who lauded national self sufficiency anticipating the conceptual separation of civil political from social economic rights in the un charter the geneva school posed the rights of capital and investors against the rights of people the right to move capital freely over borders and protection from expropriation and capital control philip cortney an extremist neoliberal at that time went so far as to liken human rights to appeasing hitler and exchange control as an act of aggression his lasting contribution was to frame economic rights in the language of human rights slobodian reviews in detail the involvement of the geneva school with three institutions the 1947 general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the european economic community eec established by the 1957 treaty of rome and the 1995 world trade organization from the 1944 bretton woods meeting came the international monetary fund and world bank but not an institution for overseeing world trade the globalists were split between universalists and constitutionalists the universalists opposed all protectionist preferential interests while others more pragmatically saw the eec as a model of a future global constitution based arrangement they called for formal equality among states and saw danger in pluralistic demands that could easily threaten the system as a whole the constitutionalists saw that at times the state needed to absorb challenges and reach settlements such as by providing welfare or labour benefits haberler a universalist wanted to strengthen gatt as a watchdog against europe europe may profit but the world economy as a whole loses p 203 the geneva school defined orders as a perpetually shifting relationship for guiding price signals the concept of supranational mechanisms to protect capital emerges in tax havens and banking secrecy investor state dispute settlement arbitration fiduciary obligations to grow capital in corporations and pension funds buying up sovereign debt slobodian s concluding chapter is titled a world of people without a people to this reader the neoliberal theorists resemble arendt s eichmann in their dehumanizing of humans and seeming obliviousness to the human condition slobodian describes two book covers petersmann following cortney was a vocal proponent of using the language of human rights to build a world economic order petersmann s book cover is ironically from communist artist diego rivera s calla lilly vendor a woman bowed under the weight of a mountain of beautiful white flowers petersmann blind to human suffering called it an icon of the freedom to sell in the market place slobodian pointed out that across the street from the centre william rappard in geneva which first housed the international labour organization and then the gatt petersmann would have to have seen the monument to work miners picking at a coalface fishers at sea farmers tilling and hauling crops a hooded indigenous man carrying pelts a man in a worker s apron holding pincers and a black african man with a hoe engraved in the plinth labor exists above all struggle for competition it is not a commodity the second book cover is from former wto director pascal lamy s book barely perceptible beneath a grid of crosses and flecks of color is a mercator projection of the world absent are people there is much to think about here in our world of intellectual confusion in which words obscure the relationship of people with each other slobodian s original source material helps to disentangle one significant reversal the hand of the market is not an invisible sublime process often the hand belongs to eichmann like people for whom people in general are invisible this double invisibility links neoliberalism with liberalism in its pre marxist and pre freudian assumptions about individuals and society resulting in gross reductionism there is marx concept of reification and freud s concept of condensing ideas with things capital is treated as an irreducible thing in itself this obviously leads to the disastrous commodification monetization of human life and of the basic necessities of life the so called ecosystem services how can military spending for killing use the same unit of measurement as spending for goods and services that are to protect priceless life arendt s insight into eichmann and his society is that this kind of immorality is banal and is not seen for what it is neoliberalism mystifies and idealizes there is no alternative too big to fail behaviorism and neuro reductionism are the complementary psychologies marxist historian ellen meiksins wood writes of england s pristine capitalism not palpable and material and describes how even the richness of the english language became sterile during the 18th century english enlightenment in shakespeare s great play on justice the merchant of venice cannot see ordinary human materiality as represented in the figure of shylock the merchant s character and his legalistic compatriots live in a constricted world of capital and are shorn of feelings desires and inner conflict shylock demands a pound of flesh from the merchant as payment of debt bodily pain in exchange for the emotional pain of being disrespected and robbed of his personhood at the same time that the geneva school first worked together robert musil was writing the novel the man without qualities we learn in the first few pages that the man is a scholar who thinks only in quantities who walks past an accident victim and only thinks of accident statistics who calculates human energy output but who has unpredicted bursts of physical aggressiveness quite a contrast to james joyce s ulysses whose everyman irish jewish leopold bloom knows his own inner feelings and bodily sensations and who is able to love people human invisibility is intrinsic to the current frightening and pathogenic belief system as a case in point in a recent lawsuit against gender discrimination walmart women employees were not legally recognized as a class and could not file a class action lawsuit while the walmart corporation was legally recognized as a person autonomous institutions that are unanswerable to the people demand urgent attention the omnipresent supranational political economic order backed by the military and law threatens human extinction from climate change and nuclear war and the people in charge are impervious it is virtually hidden in plain sight
the larry doby post office is located at 194 ward street in paterson new jersey across the street from my congressional office dedicated on august 28 1933 by the legendary postmaster general james farley the structure was one of the many built by franklin d roosevelt s administration in the throes of the great depression while it may not have one of the stunning murals created by roosevelt s section of painting and sculpture i still marvel at the managed grandeur of its deco buttressing the green glow of the elevated banker s lamps off the marble walls and the banks of brass p o boxes my hometown has bounced like a cork in seas of social tumult but the ward street post office has endured as i ve always known it there is a cynical trope that congress spends too much time naming post offices but i don t view the matter as insignificant post offices are open gates to american history and markers of an optimistic past even as smartphones and electronic communication permeate every crevice of daily life the united states postal service usps forms a lifeblood circulatory system connecting every community in the union for this reason my work to rename the ward street building for doby an african american baseball legend and favorite son of paterson remains a highlight of my career unfortunately when it comes to congress and the post office the problem isn t too much affection for decades congress s attitude toward the post has ranged from neglect to hostility as a result the usps is struggling in november 2018 it announced a net decline of 3 9 billion continuing a twelve year negative run the agency has been subjected to withering criticism by a spate of congressional hearings and government accountability office analyses a recent task force created by president trump labeled the postal service s financial path unsustainable and recommended changes that would push the post closer to complete privatization under mounting political pressure the post office itself has endorsed draconian layoffs and proposed ending saturday delivery among other savage cuts what is causing all these troubles is the postal service hopelessly outdated and dysfunctional no while it s tempting to think of it as a mastodon from the pre internet era the post remains one of the most impressive enterprises on earth the usps handles 47 percent of the world s mail delivering nearly 150 billion mail pieces annually it delivers more in sixteen days than ups and fedex combined ship in a year the agency has roughly half a million career employees spread out across almost 31 000 locations post offices are tucked into every state across far flung native american reservations and in remote protectorates if it were a private business the post would rank around fortieth on the fortune 500 and you can send a letter from coast to coast for two quarters and a nickel less than the cost of a candy bar in 2006 congress required that the postal service pre fund its health benefit obligations at least fifty years into the future this rule has accounted for nearly 90 percent of the post s red ink since not surprising then that americans consistently rank the post office among the most popular arms of government a february 2018 poll by the pew research center for example found that 88 percent of americans have a positive view of it that s higher than the approval ratings for the centers for disease control and prevention the federal reserve and the federal bureau of investigation it s true that technological change has affected the postal service s fortunes as people send fewer and fewer letters the volume of first class mail continues to tumble between 2016 and 2018 it dropped by more than 4 5 billion pieces this depresses the post s revenue forcing it to take on more debt which in turn puts it under greater financial pressure but as online shopping slowly replaces in person retail the post is sending and delivering more packages than ever before which compensates somewhat for lost revenue lower mail volume is not the main issue in reality most of the post s wounds are politically inflicted in the early 1970s congress passed legislation that shoehorned the agency into a convoluted half public half corporate governing structure to make it operate more as a business and in 2006 congress required that the postal service pre fund its health benefit obligations at least fifty years into the future this rule has accounted for nearly 90 percent of the post s red ink since for the most part these harmful reforms have originated on the political right to argue that the postal service needs to be privatized conservatives need to show that it is dysfunctional and there s no better way to do that than by weighing the agency down with impossible financial obligations it continues a generation long pattern of institutional vandalism by republicans across government but ultimately both parties bear responsibility i should know i was in congress when we passed the 2006 bill and along with all my colleagues i made the mistake of voting for it but the good news is that just as congress put the postal service on its current dangerous trajectory so can congress put it on a sustainable path bringing our cherished institution back to full health in fact i believe we can go even further with its massive infrastructure network post offices could revolutionize how the american people perform a variety of essential tasks from voting to paying taxes to banking tapping into this network has the potential to revitalize both the postal service and our democracy instead of discussing how to cut the post office we should be talking about how to expand it arguments about whether the post should operate like a business date back to america s founding while debating the original post office act a group including alexander hamilton argued that the post should support itself and make money for the rest of the government others including george washington and james madison didn t seem to care whether it turned a profit jonathan trumbull the speaker of the house of representatives in 1792 observed that having the post subsidize the circulation of periodicals would be among the surest means of preventing the degeneracy of a free government in the end washington and madison won the day the government allowed printers to ship their newspapers and magazines at a very low cost one cent to destinations within 100 miles and one and a half cents to destinations more than 100 miles away this set off what one researcher called the greatest explosion of newspapers in history and with it an explosion in literacy by the mid nineteenth century mark the washingtonian view of the post as a public good was deeply entrenched an early congressional postal commission posited that the post office existed not for generating revenue but for elevating our people in the scale of civilization and binding them together in patriotic affection legislation enacted between 1845 and 1851 codified inexpensive letter postage and further redefined the post s place in public life the ratification of these reforms signaled the full defeat of the idea that the post must be independent it was entitled to government support deficits be damned over the ensuing hundred years the post would usher in a second american revolution delivery of home mail precipitated road building and allowed americans to fan out and settle across the nation postal contracts sustained the construction of transcontinental railways that would have otherwise been economically unsustainable and it was the post office not the military that got the u s government to finally invest in aviation and help birth commercial flying the post has also been an agent of upward social mobility for generations african americans were locked out of good government jobs but as the federal bureaucracy began to desegregate black workers joined the usps en masse under the harding and coolidge administrations black people made up between 15 and 30 percent of postal employees making the agency one of america s foremost incubators of the black middle class the post also factored significantly into roosevelt s efforts to fight the great depression between 1932 and 1937 the government built more than 1 300 post offices many were enhanced with the beautiful murals fdr believed would bring art to the nation the agency s central role in america s development was perhaps best summarized in the postal policy act of 1958 when congress declared that the post was clearly not a business enterprise conducted for profit but a public service designed to promulgate social cultural intellectual and commercial intercourse among the people of the united states but in the 1960s that view began to change after years of underinvestment relative to the rise in demand for its services the post faced a huge mail backlog in chicago ten million pieces of undelivered mail piled up in the city and the lyndon johnson administration established a commission to look into the agency it was headed by a former at t chairman and stacked with ceos and business school deans in 1970 the post office was wracked by a debilitating worker strike the backlog and the strike spurred a political overreaction following the strike and the commission s 1968 recommendations congress passed the postal reorganization act of 1970 which exiled the postmaster general from the president s cabinet and downgraded the post office from a federal department to an independent federal agency ostensibly designed to modernize the post and free it from a history of patronage the legislation proved profoundly shortsighted it required that the post largely pay for its operations out of its own revenues and it split leadership of the postal service between the postmaster general and a board of governors the latter of which has been largely dominated by technocrats who see the post foremost as a business at the same time however the post was still subject to congressional oversight it s hard to imagine any corporation that would agree to operate under this peculiar hybrid structure even today most americans don t realize that despite their reliance on it our post is not a part of the government in the same way as the department of agriculture or the pentagon and receives effectively no support from the federal budget unfortunately the 1970 bill was only the first in a series of legislative blows against the post from 1808 until 1995 congress had a full congressional committee for the postal service but as part of his war on government speaker newt gingrich relegated its duties to the present day oversight and reform committee where they were assigned to a postal service subcommittee in 2001 the republican house majority disbanded the subcommittee altogether but the most destructive change of all was the postal accountability and enhancement act paea the bill has an unfortunate history it was hurried to the floor during a lame duck congress weeks after republicans were routed from their twelve year congressional majority in the 2006 midterms committee leaders told us that the legislation was critical to saving the post and we were rushed into voting for the bill without fully considering its motivations or long term impacts the legislation was passed by voice vote without objection it was a blunder one of the worst pieces of legislation congress has passed in a generation while the paea included some positive measures including giving the post increased autonomy over its rates the law generally tightened a noose around the usps it further narrowed the post s charter and prohibited the postal service from engaging in new activities outside of mail delivery the law s most destructive section innocuously labeled postal service retirement and health benefits funding imposed an unusual requirement on how the post covers its employee health pensions prior to 2006 the post funded its pensions like all agencies pay as you go now however the agency had to pre fund the health care benefits of employees at least fifty years in advance to meet this requirement the post was obligated to place approximately 5 5 billion into a pension fund each year between 2007 and 2016 followed by additional large annual payments even today most americans don t realize that despite their reliance on it our post is not a part of the government in the same way as other agencies and receives effectively no support from the federal budget the measure has been a fiendish straitjacket akin to making a prospective homeowner cover an entire thirty year mortgage before the ink is dry on the deed the provision is even more onerous given that the government requires the treasury to invest all postal workers retiree money in government bonds guaranteeing miniscule returns unsurprisingly the post has defaulted on all of its pre funding payments since 2011 to the tune of at least 40 billion in each of the last three years the pre funding burden well exceeded the post s total losses overall pre funding accounts for almost all of its losses since 2006 no other agency or department is subject to this requirement so why is the postal service the george w bush administration demanded its inclusion and used the savings it generated to try to balance the budget dutiful republicans said it was necessary to ensure that the post doesn t generate a huge unfunded liability that would require a bailout from the government an absurd posture they still maintain but the requirement s main upshot has been to plunge the postal service into a perpetual fiscal crisis that in turn justifies further attacks from the right full privatization is still neither politically nor logistically feasible but that won t stop republicans and their allies from trying trump s recent postal service task force fits into the gradual push toward privatization the task force s ultimate conclusion bore all the hallmarks of a far right hit job rather than focusing on the postal service s pre funding provision which the final report actually recommended keeping the task force emphasized the supposed need to lower postal service delivery standards and eliminate employees collective bargaining rights the task force also recommended diluting the post s universal service guarantee which would wreck the agency s functionality in rural communities in a country where rural citizens already feel detached from the rest of the nation such an outcome would only widen existing cleavages convened in secret trump s task force was designed with the orwellian purpose not to save the post but to further weaken it i am heartened that democrats routinely unite to oppose privatization but merely saying that the post should not be privatized comes from a defensive posture the solutions we pursue must be bolder any serious reformation of our post begins with eliminating the odious pre funding anchor but that s only the start to really improve the agency we need to fully reject the idea that it should be run like a business there is a reason why the founders made the postal service a federal department and there s a reason why it remained that way through the better part of the twentieth century policymakers wanted to make sure that americans could affordably send and receive mail from anywhere in pursuing that aim the usps has played a key role in developing our country to that end we should evaluate reviving the u s post office department and making the postmaster general a cabinet official once more it s time that we again treat this agency like a public good rather than a private business we need to fully reject the idea that the postal service should be run like a business there s a reason why the founders made it a federal department and why it remained that way through the better part of the twentieth century nowhere is this perspective needed more than in congress in the house and senate we have become hostages to a fiscal imprisonment outlook viewing almost every question through the single calculation of whether it will raise or lower revenue republicans have used the specter of deficits as a cudgel to beat back funding increases for all departments and programs browbeaten too many democrats have gone along but while deficits matter the postal service isn t running losses because it s inefficient it s running losses because of political sabotage it s time for congress to admit that the hybrid structure it sanctioned forty nine years ago is not sustainable so long as the post exists half as a business and half as a public enterprise forced to make money even as it is constrained by preposterous rules and counterproductive meddling it will wobble and teeter meanwhile privatization advocates will continue to chip away at one of the world s most impressive agencies that doesn t mean the postal service should be free of interrogation the post for example must fix its deal with amazon the company ships perhaps two thirds of its packages through the public mail and its pricing and delivery terms are separate from those afforded to other businesses that ship through the post this comes courtesy of a secret 2013 negotiated service agreement whose provisions have been hidden from even congress the secrecy suggests that amazon is getting a deal other retailers don t enjoy there is some logic for a deal between the post and amazon but if the world s best delivery system is awarding amazon a volume discount it makes it more difficult for the company s competitors to challenge amazon s prices this sets a dangerous example for competition policy the u s postal service is a public facility it should not be used to further entrench the monopolistic power of a private company nor does it need to amazon does not have the post s infrastructure and jeff bezos s vaunted delivery drones aren t yet operational the postal service s biggest rivals ups and fedex simply can t match the agency s services in negotiations the post should take a harder line and force amazon to pay more congress can help spur the postal service into bargaining harder by using its hearing power to make the current amazon deal public given that congress has paid so little attention to the agency in the past this kind of engagement is sorely needed currently the house subcommittee that deals with the usps is responsible for monitoring a mind boggling number of other federal functions and agencies including but not limited to government management and accounting federal property intergovernmental affairs including with state and local governments and the entire civil service it s no wonder the post has become of tertiary importance in the people s house between 2005 and 2018 the house oversight committee held 417 hearings of which just seven were related to postal issues this negligence helps explain why legislation that kneecaps the usps like the 2006 postal accountability and enhancement act glides through congress before members really consider its consequences the two house members with the most control over postal issues house oversight committee chairman elijah cummings and government operations subcommittee head gerry connolly are champions of the postal service and i believe they will dedicate attention to the issues facing the agency but both of their bodies are swamped with other valuable work including bringing needed oversight to the river of corruption flowing from the trump administration over the next few years congress should therefore consider bringing back the full postal and civil service committee or at the very least creating an exclusive postal subcommittee to truly move beyond playing defense however democrats need to reimagine what the postal service can do it is after all one of the most remarkable physical systems ever created with arms in every single zip code from key west florida to utqiagvik alaska its expansiveness opens up a world of opportunity in many american communities the post office was historically called the federal building and it served as a one stop shop for numerous governmental needs tellingly fdr wanted social security to be administered through posts to assure its accessibility in smaller towns and cities for example the post office was a focal point for immigrant registration military recruitment and distributing income tax forms there is no reason that america s post offices can t again provide a variety of important governmental functions indeed today s post offices should have all tax forms readily available the government should even consider stationing irs adjutants at post offices around tax time which would ease what is for many americans one of the most stressful times of the year the postal service could also expand on the passport assistance it already provides many post offices take passport photos and process some first time applicants and renewals often this is by appointment only i believe that post offices should offer full passport services to any american who walks through the doors in addition to serving as a gateway to america s bureaucracy the post could serve as a door to the rest of the world state governments should take advantage of america s postal infrastructure as well in particular by expanding the use of vote by mail which when done right is proven to increase political participation turning mailboxes into voting booths would therefore be good for the engagement of our citizenry the post could further weave itself into american democracy by allowing congressional representatives to station their district staff right in community post offices but perhaps the most promising service that post offices could provide is banking today sixty eight million americans more than a quarter of u s households lack access to adequate banking services many are shut out by high fees tied to minimum balances overdrafts direct deposit penalties and atm charges as a result they are left to unregulated payday lenders and check cashers that level obscene annual percentage rates the postal inspector general found that underbanked americans spend 89 billion each year on financial fees this closed system shackles families to poverty further cementing the economic inequality tearing our country apart postal branches could offer a range of banking services including savings accounts deposit services and even small lending at a 90 percent discount compared to what predatory lenders provide according to a report commissioned by the usps inspector general this would give many families an average savings of 2 000 a year while putting nearly 9 billion into the post s coffers postal banking could even unite liberals and trump supporters rural communities are america s most bank starved 90 percent of zip codes lacking a bank or credit union lie in rural areas bank branches are also sparse in poorer urban areas and 46 percent of latino and 49 percent of african american households are unbanked the postal service is well positioned to help both communities some 59 percent of post offices lie in bank deserts or places where there is no more than one branch where financial institutions close their doors to these communities post offices remain open to anyone who walks inside and this change wouldn t even need the approval of congress requiring only the postmaster general s consent pilot programs could then begin immediately including in places like 194 ward street in my own city of paterson ultimately these reforms would expand on the post s democratic tradition for centuries the agency has connected far flung parts of the country at little cost letting it help citizens pay their taxes obtain passports vote and bank would better connect americans with their federal government in doing so these reforms could help mend our citizenry s chronically low confidence in the federal government they could also make the agency s contribution to public life already enormous more visible to the people it serves and that would make it more difficult for anti government zealots to tear the agency apart

a guatemalan congressman once shared with me that ngos in central america deny or are reluctant to report development achievements fearing that should they succeed their funding will stop herein lies the destructive impact of taxpayer funded foreign aid if there is money flowing without private accountability suddenly everyone has a problem and no incentive to fix anything being a third world nation is as much a boon for people with the right connections as it is for first world workers who enjoy cushy roles and live in gated communities in exotic locations perhaps sensing this recurring problem the trump administration recently cut 450 million in aid to the northern triangle el salvador guatemala and honduras the straw that broke the camel s back was their unwillingness to curb the vast flows of illegal migrants and drugs to the united states manifested in waves now known as migrant caravans not only have these nations not curbed the flows their immense corruption lawlessness extortion and violence drive more people to join the queue north on corruption alone aid there should have been suspect all three are comfortably in the bottom half of transparency international s ranking of corruption perceptions with el salvador the least worst at 105th out of 180 ranked nations the united states and canada are 22nd and ninth respectively the migrants know the risks death rape and disease along the way but even a glimpse at life in the united states is enough of an allure the train of death a network that works throughout mexico didn t get its name for nothing as highlighted by pedro ultreras in la bestia a 2011 documentary economic fundamentals the rationale behind aid to central america is that it would improve living conditions there so residents don t need to seek a better life abroad mark jones of the baker institute at rice university for example wrote that the only effect will be to worsen the already dismal security and economic conditions these worsened conditions will in turn push even more guatemalans hondurans and salvadorans to embark on the arduous and dangerous journey to the united states although a well informed scholar jones s assumptions are incorrect economic incentives dictate that you get more of what you subsidize this is the fundamental law of supply the higher the price of an item the higher the quantity suppliers will offer and vice versa holding other factors constant in central america and elsewhere aid upholds not good governance but cronyism and corruption defense coordination if we think in the broader sense of aid does have a role in national security and can be utilized towards the rule of law however in general foreign aid encourages dependence and is best left to private charity for emergencies as explained by the late great economist gary becker of the university of chicago no nation has gotten rich on account of foreign aid or ngos the foundation of economic development is the private sector piecemeal changes the best one could hope for from aid simply won t suffice for stemming outward migration development economist michael clemens explained in a 2014 literature review migration pressure only typically falls when grow past upper middle income status initial development beyond subsistence can hasten departures and he pointed to violence as more acute to migration waves hijacked funds giovanni fratti a prominent attorney in guatemala recently called for a complete halt to aid to central america not just the initial cut he shared this decision mr president is fundamental in order for guatemala to free herself from her tormentors far left ngos and ngos that receive money from usaid most u s taxpayer money to central america fratti contended has gone to socialists they are devoted to divisive gender and racial politics and halting mining and infrastructure development many are rebranded marxist guerrillas who fought on behalf of fidel castro in the 1970s and 1980s the guerrilla army of the poor created guatemala s committee of united campesinos for example which occupies land and violates property rights everyone in central america knows the drill if you want aid money you have to play nice and comply with social justice parameters this is a predictable outcome of politicized feel good aid not subject to scrutiny from private investors and lenders if you are an open critic of the u s embassy and its progressive inclinations for example you can forget about aid for your cause proud innovators and entrepreneurs those with the capacity to bring the sort of development central america needs are not wasting their time with bureaucracy and political correctness they are creating as much as they can amid a sea of aid that distorts the economy and rewards beggars entrepreneurs don t need handouts or government loans but the rule of law which doesn t exist in central america along with free trade and foreign investment the tendency for aid to go to socialists isn t new or unique to latin america even on the home front the national endowment for democracy awards grants to weak kneed progressives such as the global americans ngo taxpayer dollars pay to promote a universal basic income for central america to counter the supposed harm of automation such welfare pimps and luddites are in no position to preach about economic development or the private sector as documented in the the latin americans by carlos rangel ernesto che guevara had the audacity in the early 1960s to criticize the united states for not delivering enough aid to latin america even the hero of communists who fought with the castro brothers in the 1959 revolution was ungrateful and wanted more generous handouts from the united states it will never be enough meanwhile we are waiting for his socialist paradise to arrive as cuba is running out of paper and venezuela can t supply electricity a half century of u s aid has failed to deliver any meaningful respite to the economic and political failures of latin america exhibited by an endless line of people escaping the burden of proof is on those who want more spending since the united

president donald trump s decision to fill two vacant positions on the board of governors of the federal reserve with political supporters has experts concerned about the impact such a move would have on the credibility of the central bank as an independent data driven policymaking body both domestically and around the world last month trump said he would nominate stephen moore a conservative economic commentator known for his devotion to supply side economics to fill one empty seat on the board last thursday the president said he planned to appoint herman cain the former ceo of a pizza chain and an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 republican presidential nomination to the other neither moore nor cain has the sort of background or experience normally expected of nominees to the board of the world s most powerful central bank but each has been a vocal supporter of trump who is currently waging a one sided war of words with the fed over what he sees as excessively tight monetary policy trump s campaign to lower interest rates trump has put great public pressure on jerome powell the chairman of the federal reserve board to abandon a plan to gradually raise interest rates over the next few years the central bank held rates at or near zero for more than six years during and after the great recession and has been slowly increasing them since early 2016 during the recovery it also implemented a last ditch economic stimulus policy called quantitative easing under which the fed bought trillions of dollars worth of u s treasury securities and mortgage backed securities as a means of injecting cash into the economy when interest rates could not be forced any lower the fed has been slowly selling off those holdings as the economy strengthens trump has repeatedly demanded that powell lower rates again despite the fact that the current target rate of between 2 25 and 2 50 while higher than it was when trump took office is still historically low on friday morning the president took his campaign against the fed chairman a step further telling reporters at the white house that the central bank should resume quantitative easing it s certainly unprecedented for a president to go on camera and give essentially an ad libbed multitiered criticism and give a specific direction for monetary policy said mark hamrick senior economic analyst for bankrate larry kudlow the chief white house economic adviser said on cnn s state of the union program on sunday that trump isn t trying to interfere with the central bank s independence but that he has every right to put people on the federal reserve board with a different point of view kudlow added that trump wants people on the fed who share his philosophy while insisting this is not a political issue if moore and cain are able to navigate the nomination process successfully something that is far from certain they would become de facto representatives of the president on the federal open market committee which sets interest rate targets because the fomc has 10 voting members they would probably not be able to have an immediate effect on u s monetary policy but the role of the fed in the u s and world economies goes well beyond simply setting interest rates fed s impact on the dollar for example actions at the fed can have substantial impacts on the value of the u s dollar during the financial crisis when banks around the world were besieged by depositors looking to exchange foreign funds for the safety of u s currency and bidding up prices in the process the fed mounted a massive loan campaign to provide other countries central banks with a supply of dollars the action went little noticed at the time and was broadly seen by experts as a well considered response to a crisis situation but in an administration that touts its america first policies loans to foreign countries in the midst of an economic crisis could easily be exploited by political opportunists having two members of the fed board with close political ties to the president could make executing that sort of policy extremely difficult in the future the fed also plays a large role in the regulation and supervision of the u s financial services industry and works closely with other central banks around the world to prevent and respond to financial crises for all those reasons experts are worried about the effect such a pair of nominations would have on the central bank s reputation as an institution where decisions are made based on rigorous economic analysis moore is a prolific writer and commentator on economic issues but he has a reputation for getting basic facts and economic theories wrong often in service of partisan political ends he has acknowledged that he will be on a steep learning curve myself about how the fed operates according to published reports steve is a perfectly amiable guy but he does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job wrote n gregory mankiw a harvard university economist who served as the chairman of the council of economic advisers in the george w bush administration cain on the surface at least has a connection to the federal reserve system he served as chairman of the board of the federal reserve bank of kansas city for a little more than a year and a half however fed bank boards actually have no responsibilities related to monetary policy or in setting regulatory policy in his run for the gop presidential nomination in 2012 the former ceo of godfather s pizza received considerable attention for his simplistic 9 9 9 tax plan which aimed at cutting three major tax rates to 9 each he has also been a vocal advocate of returning the u s to the gold standard a policy almost all economists view as dangerous snake oil and one that would make cain an extreme outlier on the fed board experts say they worry about the central bank s ability to be a calming presence for global markets if two of the seats on the fed board are filled by men who economists simply refuse to take seriously fed s importance in times of crisis we learned in 2007 08 that when there is a financial crisis the world everybody from the traders in the bond market to ordinary workers and citizens looks to washington and says gosh this is bad we hope that there s some grown ups in charge who can reassure us that things are going to be alright said david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution a washington think tank wessel said trump s key economic policy figures like treasury secretary steve mnuchin and national economic council chairman kudlow were chosen more for loyalty to the president than for their policymaking acumen there may be nobody with the gravitas to reassure global markets in the event of a major economic disruption he added that means the institution to which people will be looking in a crisis is the federal reserve wessel said that s just one more reason why it s important that the federal reserve be seen as an island of sanity and competence in a city where everything else seems to be chaos and polarized politics to be sure neither moore nor cain is guaranteed to wind up on the fed board in the end both would have to be confirmed by the senate and would carry considerable baggage into their confirmation hearings moore s checkered financial past moore for instance was once found in contempt of court for failure to pay some 300 000 in child support and alimony after a divorce he also owes the federal government more than 75 000 in unpaid taxes and penalties according to a lien filed in federal court last year cain had to end his bid for the republican presidential nomination in 2012 after at least five women came forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual behavior he denied the accusations but was forced to withdraw from the race even if both men were to fail in the nomination process though critics like wessel say that the very willingness of the president to nominate them in the first place is damaging it makes people wonder what is the president doing to our institutions if he is willing to put people like this on the most important economic body in the world he said

outlook now that hysteria over a looming recession has abated we can look more reasonably at this week s data although it doesn t begin until wednesday with march cpi nobody is forecasting a change of any size we also get the fed minutes thursday brings ppi and friday the preliminary university of michigan april consumer sentiment index there is no game changer in here there s probably a game changer for sterling in the works april 12 the current deadline for brexit is this friday traders are still buying the pound on the assumption that may gets a longer extension to june 30 or perhaps even longer if the eu decides to shove it down the uk s throat but potential game changers are not missing entirely the wsj warns that this weak the earnings season starts in earnest and it may not be pretty see the chart just about every sector is expected to show a drop and the stock market can freak out over that in the background is a nagging worry that ray dalio might be right as he said on 60 minutes last night income inequality is a national emergency if we can spot a theme emerging it might be that central bank independence is being eroded and not just in the us if we get a low inflation number this week more trumpian calls for a rate cut will probably ensue at some point opinion will start swinging toward accepting political interference with the central bank according to a bloomberg story this is a big worry at fitch ratings and we agree unconventional ideas are gaining sway now that the global economy is slowing and central banks have run out of tools this opens the door to modern monetary theory which is utter bs but appealing to the uneducated on both the left and the right be very worried when a socialist congresswoman agrees with trump the proponents of mmt say among other things that governments can issue as much paper money and sovereign debt as they like to goose the economy without regard for the inflation mandate bloomberg notes that in the uk labour would like to see the boe start including a productivity target stay tuned mmt has the potential to blow up in some spectacular ways the supposed synchronous global slowdown is actually true and visible to some extent we may have put too much weight on pmis in recent years as the top leading indicator but it s a fact of life and the pmis are fairly grim gittler at acls offers one of his splendid charts and try not to fall off your chair this one shows germany way off in the failing corner we d like to know how mr draghi feels about that the fed is also under attack from trump s dual goal of disruption and acquiring lackeys in high office pundits are coming up with excuses for why it s okay for trump to nominate thoroughly unqualified and dingbat candidates to the fed board moore and cain the reasoning is that it s the behind the scenes staffers who do the real work and get the credit for the fed s reputation for analytical excellence and policy soundness among the public not so those in a position to get press headlines have tremendous influence over public perception just imagine if cain started getting a lot of spotlight time and brings up the gold standard out of the woodwork would come every crackpot and there s more of them than we might think geo political risks abound although it s not clear any of them are going to affect the fx market this week first up is brexit criticism is starting to swing away from may to the tory party for not being able to get its act together forcing may to make nice with corbyn recent photos seem to show corbyn took a bath then there s the israeli election we d put a dollar on bibi dem presidential candidate o rourke made a giant political mistake calling bibi a racist the best candidate so far is the mayor from indiana but will the voters go for a gay guy in addition the trump administration is mismanaging to an even greater extent another cabinet member has resigned homeland security s nielson she of the policy of caging small refugee children and losing track of their parents trump is still blathering about closing the border which really upsets the chamber of commerce and demanding mexico take responsibility for managing the hordes of central american migrants massing on the border turns out that it s true in recent weeks a new horde showed up trump says the country is full we are suspicious of these hordes who is inspiring them who is funding them this is not to dismiss awful conditions or the genuine desire to get out but we don t believe in coincidence in a case like this it s suspiciously convenient for the anti immigrant folks that hordes are showing up right when trump is seeking to divert dept of defense money to the border wall this is unconstitutional when article 1 gives the power of the purse to congress but runs smack into the president s emergency powers when there really are hordes as for us mexico relations the wto is holding a conference on nafta in mexico this week unfortunately this doesn t pass the so what test nor does the g20 meeting this week in preparation for the g20 summit in osaka in june then there s venezuela where the russians have troops and trump is too lily livered to enforce the monroe doctrine that says the western hemisphere is the us sphere of influence on friday the treasury imposed sanctions on some venezuelan owned shippers sending oil to cuba which of course reminds everyone of the failed cuban invasion and later showdown at sea the treassec is on the hot seat for another reason he is the boss of the irs commissioner and both are trump lackeys theoretically the treassec can instruct the irs commissioner to disobey the order from congress for trump s tax returns and what about the china trade deal nobody knows economic advisor kudlow told bloomberg tv a deal is getting close but the failure to get a summit date belies the puffery then there s the strange case of the gold buying spree by china bloomberg reports china added gold to reserves for the 4th month by 11 2 tons in march following of 9 95 tons in february 11 8 tons in january and 9 95 tons in december bloomberg says china is both the world s top gold producer and consumer last year s bullion buying by emerging market central banks was the most robust in a long time as countries diversified reserves ed morse citigroup inc s global head of commodities research said in a bloomberg tv interview on monday the bank s positive on gold targeting 1 400 by year end morse is smarter than just about anybody goldman sachs agrees expecting a rally to 1 450 an ounce over 12 months governments worldwide added 651 5 tons of bullion in 2018 the second highest total on record according to the world gold council russia has quadrupled its reserves within the span of a decade amid president vladimir putin s quest to break the country s reliance on the dollar and data from the central bank show holdings rose 1 million ounces in february the most since november bottom line a mess of disparate factors perhaps none of which is big enough on its own to drive prices but with a potential cumulative effect of creating fear of the future we know what happens when fear gets the upper hand risk aversion favors the dollar it s getting about time for trump to complain about that isn t it this is an excerpt from the rockefeller morning briefing which is far larger

tax reform which has historically been reserved for times of economic turmoil not expansion how are we going to stimulate fiscal policy he asked recently on cnbc s trading nation we already did that at the peak of the cycle we don t have the fiscal ammunition corporate debt nearing half of u s gdp rosenberg recently spoke at the cfa societies texas investor summit in san antonio u s global investors hometown where he laid out his thought process since the last recession nonfinancial corporate debt has ballooned to more than 9 trillion as of november 2018 which is nearly half of u s gdp as you can see below each recession going back to the mid 1980s coincided with elevated debt to gdp levels most notably the 2007 2008 financial crisis the 2000 dotcom bubble and the early 90s slowdown click to enlarge through 2023 as much as 4 88 trillion of this debt is scheduled to mature and because of higher rates many companies are increasingly having difficulty making interest payments on their debt which is growing faster than the u s economy according to the institute of international finance iif on top of that the very fastest growing type of debt is riskier bbb rated bonds just one step up from junk this is literally the junkiest corporate bond environment we ve ever seen combine this with tighter monetary policy and it could be a recipe for trouble in the coming months during his presentation rosenberg reiterated the saying that business cycles don t die of old age but rather they re killed by the fed take a look at the chart below it shows commercial and industrial loan delinquency rates overlaid by fed fund rates shifted 10 quarters ahead what it suggests is that roughly 10 quarters after the fed began to tighten loan delinquencies surged click to enlarge the good news is that it s been more than 10 quarters since the fed started lifting rates in december 2015 and so far we haven t seen a noticeable increase in delinquencies could this be because the rate hikes this cycle have been small relative to those in past cycles not likely says rosenberg according to him it s not the amount that matters so much as the change whether rates go up 2 50 percent or only 0 25 percent it can still be a shock on the financial system to be clear i m not predicting a recession any time soon only passing along rosenberg s expert opinion but if his position makes sense to you it might be time to consider your options on how to prepare rosenberg recommends overweighting fixed income and reits real estate investment trusts i would add gold to that mix as it s performed well as a store of value during economic pullbacks as always i recommend a 10 percent weight in gold with 5 percent in gold bars coins and jewelry and 5 percent in gold stocks mutual funds and etfs

europe s 2nd biggest gold mine could be about to make early investors rich this is a story that began over 2 000 years ago when the romans dug up 16 8 billion in gold using only hammers and buckets and more recently in a small town near the heart of this treasure trove miners may have identified even more over 13 3 billion in deep veined gold in fact but everything came to a screeching halt in 2007 all mining was put on hold and desperate prospectors were scrambling to get back in but only one has been able so far a little company armed with big ambitions and game changing tech has received the green light to unearth the rest using modern technology they re hoping to exploit an estimated 13 3 billion find smart investors are following this once in a lifetime discovery closely gmp research says this little company could realize 550 per ounce profit and their mine is so promising barrick gold have invested 20 million to develop it the company s stock according to cantor fitzgerald is inexpensive by any and all metrics that s right it s a steal because few people yet have heard the story of euro sun mining inc tsx esm otcpk cpnff based at their mine in rovina romania euro sun has 400 million tons of ore with billions of dollars worth of gold and copper locked inside cantor fitz thinks they are undervalued by 218 and gmp research predicts a 355 gain with such a huge find ready for the taking this could be the gold story of 2019 plus any small move on the gold market could accelerate the company s rise from 5x to 10x to even 30x its current market cap here are five reasons investors should not miss out on the biggest gold story of 2019 1 re discovered 13 billion romanian treasure euro sun has captured an asset of immense value a romanian gold mine that was first proven one hundred years ago the ancient romans excavated 16 8 billion in gold from this area of romania minting coins that were scattered across an empire 11 million square miles in size the problem acquiring permits can be labor intensive and sometimes impossible thanks to eu regulation back when permits were available barrick gold nyse abx the world s most valuable gold miner got in on the action the company pumped in 20 million to develop rovina now rovina is owned by euro sun and euro sun has done the impossible it just got its hands on a mining permit the rovina mine has been classified as a highly scalable asset with an immense growth potential according to cantor fitzgerald mines like rovina are hard to come by even though the area is rich in ore and euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff has gotten around its toughest problem acquiring the licenses it needs to start developing rovina s full potential the mining license from the romanian government was approved in november 2018 the first license to have been given out since 2003 a resource statement from 2012 offers a view of the potential riches 400 million tons of ore in three bodies roughly 7 1 million ounces of gold and a billion and a half pounds of copper or 10 1 million ounces of gold equivalent in february 2019 euro sun completed its preliminary economic assessment pea for rovina the mine looks ready to produce an average gold equivalent of 139 000 ounces and 1 6 million over twelve years all told the company is looking at 9 3 billion in gold and 4 billion in copper a total haul of 13 3 billion better yet the mine is perfectly situated near a romanian mining town with a population of 13 000 road and rail transportation is close at hand ready to carry the mine s product to market based on the company s current market cap the upside potential here is incredible any small move in gold will soon bring this story to the front page 2 when gold moves a little little miners move hundreds of percent now is the time to buy gold analysts are optimistic that prices should continue to climb potentially exceeding 1400 ounce due to declining gold stores right now gold stocks are trading cheap as they have been since january but one thing that investors and speculators often forget is how explosive gold stock upside is when gold moves higher and when gold goes up gold companies tend to do very very well every 1 move in gold can send a small miner up 10 or more and a 10 move can send a small miner up 100 or more back in 2016 gold prices jumped 26 in 6 months and gold miner returns were stellar mid cap miners such as endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months while its ontario based competitor iamgold gained 256 in that same timeframe but some of the real winners were the shareholders of small cap miners argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 in gold production companies like euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff could start selling at a premium when the gold market turns but this story gets even better there s a bigger nearby catalyst 3 speculation euro sun to be acquired by chinese soon china just spent 1 4 billion down the street with this incredible find it s no wonder that analysts are starting to speculate about euro sun could the company be snatched up soon delivering a huge windfall to early investors it s certainly a strong possibility analysts in the mining sector are already hinting that euro sun could be acquired and we think china might have a part to play because they just spent 1 4 billion to acquire a mine right down the street from euro sun china is making a big global investment push as part of its 900 billion belt and silk road initiative chinese investment along the road is surging covering 68 countries china wants to acquire assets along the silk road route gold silver copper you name it and that route runs right through romania and the chinese have just paid 1 4 billion to acquire another mining asset which sits right down the street from euro sun china s nearby acquisition could also take years to fully license and euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff on a site with zero ancient ruins is even better positioned for a multi billion dollar payday the rovina mine is fully licensed it s poised to become one of the biggest gold and copper mine in europe it s right next to a major romanian mining town of brad which has already excavated 17 billion in gold in the last 100 years in fact brad s coat of arms prominently features a mining cart there s ample access to talent transportation and infrastructure as well as a nearby sea port soon this story will hit the shores of america 4 undervalued by 218 cantor fitzgerald 355 gain gmp research in 2016 gmp declared euro sun the new old kid on the block declaring the company had 10 million ounces in gold equivalent waiting to be dug up and the numbers look even better now than they did two years ago at current prices euro sun could realize 550 in profit per ounce resulting in total revenue of 5 5 billion from rovina alone it s no wonder that gmp noted rovina has robust economics and upside if another ounce is never found euro sun already owns a potentially extremely robust project gmp s estimate has been upheld by cantor fitzgerald which completed its own estimate in early 2019 the deposit at rovina carries strong economics on a standalone basis the only thing holding euro sun back is the fact this is happening in a small company far away from the lights of wall street but as we already explained that could change in a flash once this story gets out the management at euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff knows what it s doing the company is led by ceo and president g scott moore a business executive with twenty five years experience in the resource sector and the former evp of sulliden gold and director of avion gold moore and his team have cultivated excellent political conditions in romania evidenced by their successful acquisition of a license for the rovina mine and now all they need is the capital to take rovina to the next level and turn it into one of the largest gold mines in europe at the time of writing cantor fitz thinks they are undervalued by 218 and gmp research predicts a 355 gain 5 the 2nd biggest gold mine in europe could soon 30x and it could go much higher when gold moves a little miners like euro sun can move a lot and the company has already gotten positive attention barrick the world s largest gold miner once invested 20 million into the rovina mine the asset has been developed and has fallen into euro sun s lap now all it needs to do is exploit it cantor fitzgerald puts euro sun s short term target at 2 10 that s a 218 increase from its current price and gmp goes even further they reckon euro sun is worth 3 00 an increase of 355 this is a company with a phenomenal upside it s got a fully licensed gold mine in romania the only one of its kind that could be the biggest gold mine in europe an asset potentially worth 10 1 billion and that s only if prices stay where they are if gold edges above 1400 ounce profits from rovina could be even higher if china comes calling euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff stock could be worth 5x or 6x what it is now as it becomes the 1 gold mine in europe and if its billions in profits are one day realized that 5x could turn into 30x a company to rival barrick in size and value but the time to get in on euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff is now before it begins its run to 3 00 or more other companies looking to capitalize on the coming gold boom kinross gold corporation tsx k kinross gold corporation is relatively new on the scene founded in the early 90s but it certainly isn t lacking drive or experience in 2015 the company received the highest ranking for of any canadian miner in maclean s magazine s annual assessment of socially responsible companies while kinross posted a significant loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company is making strong moves to turn around its earnings including the hiring of a new cfo andrea s freeborough andrea s successful track record at kinross and throughout her career including accounting international finance m a and deep management experience will be an excellent addition to our leadership team said mr rollinson we have great talent at kinross and succession planning is a key aspect of retaining that talent for the future success of our company agnico eagle mines ltd tsx aem canadian based gold producer agnico eagle mines is an especially noteworthy company for investors why between 1991 2010 the company paid out dividends every year with operations in quebec mexico and finland the company also is taking place in exploration activities in europe latin america and the united states agnico is a company with a lot of exposure to gold letting investors take advantage of long term price movements though the company joins a long list of gold majors that reported losses in 2018 but its cash flow deficit is largely attributed to its growth in production and new projects coming online yamana gold nyse auy tsx yri yamana has recently completed its cerro moro project in argentina giving its investors something major to look out for the company plans to ramp up its gold production by 20 through 2019 and its silver production by a whopping 200 investors can expect a serious increase in free cash flow if precious metal prices remain stable recently yamana signed an agreement with glencore and goldcorp to develop and operate another argentinian project the agua rica initial analysis suggests the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the first 10 years of operation the agreement is a major step forward for the agua rica region and all of the miners working on it eldorado gold corp nyse ego tsx eld this canadian mid cap miner has assets in europe and brazil and has managed to cut cost per ounce significantly in recent years though its share price isn t as high as it once was eldorado is well positioned to make significant advancements in the near term in 2018 eldorado produced over 349 000 ounces of gold well above its previous expectations and is set to boost production even further in 2019 additionally eldorado is planning increased cash flow and revenue growth this year eldorado s president and ceo george burns stated as a result of the team s hard work in 2018 we are well positioned to grow annual gold production to over 500 000 ounces in 2020 we expect this will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and provide us with the opportunity to consider debt retirement later this year first majestic silver nyse ag tsx fr though first majestic recently took a significant blow as a strong dollar weighed on precious metals resulting in a poor quarterly earnings report there s still a lot of bullishness surrounding the stock adding to the negative numbers however was a string of highly valuable acquisitions which are likely to turn around for the metals giant in the mid to long term while it s primary focus remains on silver mining it does hold a number of gold assets as well additionally silver tends to follow gold s lead when wider markets begin to look shaky and with analysts sounding the alarms of a global economic slowdown both metals are likely to regain popularity among investors further boosting its portfolio the company also entered a share repurchase program as it feels that its stock is at the moment undervalued

better yet the mine is perfectly situated near a romanian mining town with a population of 13 000 road and rail transportation is close at hand ready to carry the mine s product to market based on the company s current market cap the upside potential here is incredible any small move in gold will soon bring this story to the front page 2 when gold moves a little little miners move hundreds of percent now is the time to buy gold analysts are optimistic that prices should continue to climb potentially exceeding 1400 ounce due to declining gold stores right now gold stocks are trading cheap as they have been since january but one thing that investors and speculators often forget is how explosive gold stock upside is when gold moves higher and when gold goes up gold companies tend to do very very well every 1 move in gold can send a small miner up 10 or more and a 10 move can send a small miner up 100 or more back in 2016 gold prices jumped 26 in 6 months and gold miner returns were stellar mid cap miners such as endeavour mining corp gained 196 in 6 months while its ontario based competitor iamgold gained 256 in that same timeframe but some of the real winners were the shareholders of small cap miners argonault gold s share price jumped 298 in 6 months and its peer great panther mining saw its share price even jump by a whopping 340 in no more than 4 months after it reported a 19 in gold production companies like euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff could start selling at a premium when the gold market turns but this story gets even better there s a bigger nearby catalyst 3 speculation euro sun to be acquired by chinese soon china just spent 1 4 billion down the street with this incredible find it s no wonder that analysts are starting to speculate about euro sun could the company be snatched up soon delivering a huge windfall to early investors it s certainly a strong possibility analysts in the mining sector are already hinting that euro sun could be acquired and we think china might have a part to play because they just spent 1 4 billion to acquire a mine right down the street from euro sun china is making a big global investment push as part of its 900 billion belt and silk road initiative chinese investment along the road is surging covering 68 countries china wants to acquire assets along the silk road route gold silver copper you name it and that route runs right through romania and the chinese have just paid 1 4 billion to acquire another mining asset which sits right down the street from euro sun china s nearby acquisition could also take years to fully license and euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff on a site with zero ancient ruins is even better positioned for a multi billion dollar payday the rovina mine is fully licensed it s poised to become one of the biggest gold and copper mine in europe it s right next to a major romanian mining town of brad which has already excavated 17 billion in gold in the last 100 years in fact brad s coat of arms prominently features a mining cart there s ample access to talent transportation and infrastructure as well as a nearby sea port soon this story will hit the shores of america 4 undervalued by 218 cantor fitzgerald 355 gain gmp research in 2016 gmp declared euro sun the new old kid on the block declaring the company had 10 million ounces in gold equivalent waiting to be dug up and the numbers look even better now than they did two years ago at current prices euro sun could realize 550 in profit per ounce resulting in total revenue of 5 5 billion from rovina alone it s no wonder that gmp noted rovina has robust economics and upside if another ounce is never found euro sun already owns a potentially extremely robust project gmp s estimate has been upheld by cantor fitzgerald which completed its own estimate in early 2019 the deposit at rovina carries strong economics on a standalone basis the only thing holding euro sun back is the fact this is happening in a small company far away from the lights of wall street but as we already explained that could change in a flash once this story gets out the management at euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff knows what it s doing the company is led by ceo and president g scott moore a business executive with twenty five years experience in the resource sector and the former evp of sulliden gold and director of avion gold moore and his team have cultivated excellent political conditions in romania evidenced by their successful acquisition of a license for the rovina mine and now all they need is the capital to take rovina to the next level and turn it into one of the largest gold mines in europe at the time of writing cantor fitz thinks they are undervalued by 218 and gmp research predicts a 355 gain 5 the 2nd biggest gold mine in europe could soon 30x and it could go much higher when gold moves a little miners like euro sun can move a lot and the company has already gotten positive attention barrick the world s largest gold miner once invested 20 million into the rovina mine the asset has been developed and has fallen into euro sun s lap now all it needs to do is exploit it cantor fitzgerald puts euro sun s short term target at 2 10 that s a 218 increase from its current price and gmp goes even further they reckon euro sun is worth 3 00 an increase of 355 this is a company with a phenomenal upside it s got a fully licensed gold mine in romania the only one of its kind that could be the biggest gold mine in europe an asset potentially worth 10 1 billion and that s only if prices stay where they are if gold edges above 1400 ounce profits from rovina could be even higher if china comes calling euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff stock could be worth 5x or 6x what it is now as it becomes the 1 gold mine in europe and if its billions in profits are one day realized that 5x could turn into 30x a company to rival barrick in size and value but the time to get in on euro sun tsx esm otcpk cpnff is now before it begins its run to 3 00 or more other companies looking to capitalize on the coming gold boom kinross gold corporation tsx k kinross gold corporation is relatively new on the scene founded in the early 90s but it certainly isn t lacking drive or experience in 2015 the company received the highest ranking for of any canadian miner in maclean s magazine s annual assessment of socially responsible companies while kinross posted a significant loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company is making strong moves to turn around its earnings including the hiring of a new cfo andrea s freeborough andrea s successful track record at kinross and throughout her career including accounting international finance m a and deep management experience will be an excellent addition to our leadership team said mr rollinson we have great talent at kinross and succession planning is a key aspect of retaining that talent for the future success of our company agnico eagle mines ltd

mexico and finland the company also is taking place in exploration activities in europe latin america and the united states agnico is a company with a lot of exposure to gold letting investors take advantage of long term price movements though the company joins a long list of gold majors that reported losses in 2018 but its cash flow deficit is largely attributed to its growth in production and new projects coming online yamana gold nyse auy tsx yri yamana has recently completed its cerro moro project in argentina giving its investors something major to look out for the company plans to ramp up its gold production by 20 through 2019 and its silver production by a whopping 200 investors can expect a serious increase in free cash flow if precious metal prices remain stable recently yamana signed an agreement with glencore and goldcorp to develop and operate another argentinian project the agua rica initial analysis suggests the potential for a mine life in excess of 25 years at average annual production of approximately 236 000 tonnes 520 million pounds of copper equivalent metal including the contributions of gold molybdenum and silver for the first 10 years of operation the agreement is a major step forward for the agua rica region and all of the miners working on it eldorado gold corp nyse ego tsx eld this canadian mid cap miner has assets in europe and brazil and has managed to cut cost per ounce significantly in recent years though its share price isn t as high as it once was eldorado is well positioned to make significant advancements in the near term in 2018 eldorado produced over 349 000 ounces of gold well above its previous expectations and is set to boost production even further in 2019 additionally eldorado is planning increased cash flow and revenue growth this year eldorado s president and ceo george burns stated as a result of the team s hard work in 2018 we are well positioned to grow annual gold production to over 500 000 ounces in 2020 we expect this will allow us to generate significant free cash flow and provide us with the opportunity to consider debt retirement later this year first majestic silver nyse ag tsx fr though first majestic recently took a significant blow as a strong dollar weighed on precious metals resulting in a poor quarterly earnings report there s still a lot of bullishness surrounding the stock adding to the negative numbers however was a string of highly valuable acquisitions which are likely to turn around for the metals giant in the mid to long term while it s primary focus remains on silver mining it does hold a number of gold assets as well additionally silver tends to follow gold s lead when wider markets begin to look shaky and with analysts sounding the alarms of a global economic slowdown both metals are likely to regain popularity among investors further boosting its portfolio the company also entered a share repurchase program as it feels that its stock is at the moment undervalued

again he may get his wish though not for the reason he wants the u s president on friday said the fed should cut rates and pursue an unconventional monetary policy called quantitative easing that was

said trump who has blasted the fed for raising interest rates the fed has been reducing its bond hoard as it works toward normalizing monetary policy but later this year it will stop shrinking the stockpile leaving it holding more than 3 5 trillion in securities before long the fed will be considering when to start building up its bond holdings again policymakers have said their goal at that point may not be to stimulate the economy but to keep enough money in the banking system so they can manage rates the balance sheet used to be much smaller well below 1 trillion before the crisis but

morocco plans to raise at least 1 billion from an international bond sale this year ending an approximately five year hiatus and switch to a policy of more consistent offerings to finance its broader economic overhaul programme the north african kingdom the region s only investment grade sovereign has mandated a consortium of banks for the bond sale its first since 2014 said finance and economy minister mohamed benchaaboun it also plans to go to the market again in 2020 amid efforts to hold more consistent sales he said king mohammed last year told the government to come up with a new growth model for the 105 billion economy as it steps up a crackdown on tax evasion that directive has taken on even more urgency as the eruption of unrest in neighbouring algeria sends a clear message about how a toxic mix of high youth unemployment and sputtering growth could snowball out of control the sale will take place as soon as conditions permit it this year mr benchaaboun said at the weekend in marrakesh declining to elaborate further on the timing the former chief executive of banque centrale populaire morocco s second biggest lender said the country would continue to tap the market in the most natural manner because debt in essence depreciates and so you have evidently to build up the share of external financing in the overall debt the plan marks a shift in strategy from his predecessor mohamed boussaid who was relatively reluctant to turn to the international market bloomberg said the proposed shift comes as authorities review how state owned enterprises can finance the nation s development plans and make them less reliant on government financing as it stands now the debt is counted as quasi sovereign limiting the administration s room to manoeuvre morocco s neighbour egypt has gone to the international bond market twice in the past few months most recently with a 2 billion euro offer when you are regularly present in the international bond market you set your pricing target for the debt you want to raise and evidently you also move faster in the mobilisation of financing on behalf of the lenders because they know you mr benchaaboun said moroccan officials have struggled to revive growth that has been squeezed over the past two years by drought and weak consumer demand the banking sector has also suffered bmce bank one ofmorocco s largest lenders reported this month a 10 per cent fall in its 2018 net profit attributable to shareholders due to a drop in activities in its african branches reuters reported profit stood at 1 83 billion moroccan dirhams 190 mln in 2018 down from 2 03bn dirhams in 2017 african branches accounted for 46 per cent of profits while morocco and europe represented 48 per cent and 6 per cent respectively net banking income dropped 1 per cent to 13 23bn dirhams while the cost of risk rose 2 per cent to 1 83bn dirhams the international monetary fund in the latest review of its precautionary and liquidity line arrangement with the country earlier this month said that improved fiscal management and economic diversification have made the economy more resilient though unemployment remains high especially among younger moroccans the government needs to press on with the changes it s making in order to increase productivity gains create jobs and raise growth potential in line with its medium term objectives the washington based fund said in an april 2 report the growth story can t be summed up in one quarter mr benchaaboun said pointing to the impact this year of drought on the country s labour intensive agricultural sector and a non agricultural gdp that is posting good growth levels the government is sticking to its budgeted projection of 3 2 per cent growth he said the central bank last month cut the growth projection for 2019 to 2 7 per cent citing mostly lower farming output among the measures the government is taking to boost growth is a draft bill now with parliament to protect minority rights in corporations as well as the launch later this year of the first real estate investment trust or reits which he said would provide a fundamental source of financing for businesses across the board the repercussions will not be felt overnight mr benchaaboun said stressing that authorities are confident the measures would boost growth and create jobs
