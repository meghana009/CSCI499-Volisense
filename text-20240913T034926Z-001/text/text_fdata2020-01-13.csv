win an argument with a stupid person bill murray american actor comedian filmmaker writer b 1950 by david chapman january the barometer for the market it does sound a bit hocus pocus but there really is a january barometer the january barometer was devised by yale hirsch the founder and publisher of the stock trader s almanac in 1972 the january barometer states that as the s p 500 goes in january so goes the year since 1950 the barometer has an incredible 85 5 accuracy ratio with only 10 significant errors vietnam impacted 1966 and 1968 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in august two january rate cuts and 9 11 affected 2001 anticipation of war against iraq pressured january 2003 2009 saw the start of the current bull market qe2 saved 2010 qe3 appears to have saved 2014 fears of slowdown impacted january 2016 trade tensions blew up january 2018 interesting that of the 10 errors five of them have occurred since 2009 could the barometer be changing there is also what is known as the early warning system january s first five days act as an early warning this is not as good as the january barometer but it s still interesting the record is as follows since 1950 there have been 44 up first five days and 25 down first five days of the 44 up the year ended up 36 times for an 81 8 accuracy ratio of the 25 down days the accuracy ratio was not as good as only 11 ended the year down and 14 up for a 44 0 accuracy ratio well the first five days of 2020 are in and the s p 500 was up 0 7 so it looks like 2020 is shaping up to be a good year okay past performance is no guarantee of the future of the eight exceptions three 1994 2011 and 2015 were relatively flat three were related to war years 1966 1973 and 1990 while the final two were 2002 and 2018 given that 2020 started off with a potential war could this end up being a war year a final note on the january phenomena is what happens in presidential election years for the early warning system there were 17 presidential election years of the 17 14 followed the direction of the first five days the three exceptions were 1956 1988 and 2016 for the january barometer the record wasn t quite as good with only 12 of the 17 years following the direction of january in presidential election years the five exceptions were 1956 1968 1984 1992 and 2016 given the year started off with a bang and the threat of war we wondered what the record was like during war years as we saw the threat of war and what actually happened drew two different responses the threat of war in 2020 saw stocks plummet gold leap over 1 600 and oil jump to about 66 but if you had left for a few days and came back you would have wondered what the fuss was all about at the height it was if ww3 really was about start but then all of sudden all is well at least for the moment the result is the stock market says back to normal buy buy buy gold and oil fell back to earth oh and the stock market soared to new all time highs so much for any thoughts of a top instead we had the leaders of two countries trolling each other war tends to be good for stock markets but often not initially world war i triggered a shutdown in global stock markets from july 31 2014 to december 15 2014 the nyse was closed when it opened again for trading it basically picked up where it left off before july 31 the market had been falling since the assassination of archduke ferdinand in june 1914 by february 1915 the market had found a bottom and then took off on an unparalleled bull market that didn t top until november 1916 for a gain of 110 war is good for business the market did go into a tailspin when the u s entered the war and promptly lost 40 into december 1917 but as the war wound down and it appeared the allies would win the market started to climb again overall the market gained over 40 during world war i world war ii wasn t a lot different the market had been recovering from the 1937 1938 stock market crash when hostilities broke out in september 1939 things initially did not go well the german blitzkrieg of 1940 sparked a sharp sell off and with the u s entering the war in december 1941 the downdraft continued until april 1942 the decisive u s victory at midway in june 1942 sparked the recovery and the market kept climbing until a peak in november 1945 the final peak of that bull run came in may 1946 from september 1939 at the outbreak of hostilities to august 1945 when japan surrendered the dow jones industrials dji gained just over 14 but that included the big drop into 1942 from the 1942 bottom to the top in 1946 the dji was up about 129 the korean war 1950 1953 barely caused a ripple in the stock market hostilities broke out in june 1950 and the armistice was signed in july 1953 the dji gained 31 7 during that period the market had peaked in december 1952 and july 1953 marked the start of the 1953 1954 recession one that was actually short lived and shallow the post world war ii recovery was well on its way and the korean war never garnered the same attention that world war ii did vietnam 1965 1975 was a long dragged out affair the u s was actually involved before starting way back in 1955 but it wasn t until the mid sixties that it was ramped up the gulf of tonkin incident in august 1964 helped trigger the ramp up of u s involvement in vietnam major bombing was underway by february march 1965 president nixon signed the paris peace accords in january 1973 ending direct u s involvement in vietnam but it wasn t until the fall of saigon in april 1975 that the u s completely ended its involvement from february 1965 to january 1973 the dji was only up 10 6 but if we use april 1975 as the end of u s involvement the dji actually lost just over 9 it was the inflationary 70s with the vietnam war contributing considerably to the inflation the stock market topped in january 1966 and after a series of ups and downs sparked by the watergate crisis and the arab oil embargo the market made its final bottom in december 1974 as it lost 45 from the high in january 1973 the vietnam war was not friendly to stock markets but oil and gold did well the current war on terror has been going on since september 2001 a period of just over 18 years it has become an endless war before that there was the short lived gulf war that lasted from august 1990 to february 1991 the outbreak of hostilities in august 1990 contributed to a sharp drop in the stock market and the eventual recession that followed the stock market in the end gained roughly 11 from august 1990 to february 1991 the current long war on terror that includes the invasion of iraq in 2003 the war against isis and others has become known as a never ending war the current iteration with iran is merely an extension of it that is the kind of war that prevailed during medieval times the thirty years war 1618 1648 comes to mind for the stock markets the period has included the high tech dot com bust of 2000 2002 and the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 as we have so often noted only a massive financial rescue of qe1 2 and 3 along with historically low interest rates and the biggest borrowing binge ever recorded have kept the stock markets in positive territory since 2000 the dji has gained just over 152 but the gains were all made since 2009 as before that the returns were negative the big winner through this period has been gold up 439 since the beginning of the century and that is despite the difficulties for the metal since the peak in september 2011 the january barometer and the early warning system all against the backdrop of potential war should keep us guessing going forward source www stockcharts com markets and trends gains losses trends close dec 31 19

cares about overbought the rsi hovered over 70 into late december 2019 it s eased somewhat currently about 68 the s p 500 wasn t the only one making new all time highs the s p 500 gained 0 9 on the

0 3 and looks to go higher while japan s tokyo nikkei dow tkn was up 0 4 while the new all time highs are great we remain concerned that indices like the djt are not confirming the highs they should all be making new all time highs when they are not something is usually amiss we note the divergence between the s p 500 and the s p 600 below we appear now to be right at the top of the channel of what might be an ascending wedge triangle that remains to be seen of course but we would be hard pressed to think that the coming week might be positive the run since that low in october appears to us as a classic bubble move a good comparison might be between the nasdaq today and the nasdaq of 20 odd years ago well the comparison is weak in terms of the rise but significant in terms of timing in october 1999 a huge final rally got under way from october 18 1999 to january 24 2000 the nasdaq gained 52 and to the final high on march 10 2000 the gain was 90 today with the rise from the low on october 3 2019 to date the nasdaq is up a modest 18 so no comparison direction wise yes in terms of the actual gain no but one thing in common is very high bullish sentiment that nothing is going to stop this market the first break point for the s p 500 is at 3 200 and the second is at 3 000 a break under 2 950 could be the start of a bear market friday saw an outside reversal day meaning the high was higher than the previous day s high the low was lower than the previous day s low and the market closed below the previous day s low given we were making all time highs on friday when this reversal occurred it may be that it is a key reversal unfortunately we can only confirm key reversals in hindsight meaning we need further evidence and we have to break down under key points noted above follow through to the downside will be important this week if the reversal is right and of course no new highs above 3 283 source www stockcharts com when we hit significant tops we look for divergences between indicators and the indices the major indices may be ignoring missile strikes oil market turmoil and high bullish sentiment but bearish divergences do appear one of them is seen with the vix volatility indicator which is not making new lows even as the s p 500 makes new highs no it does not indicate a top in the offing the nyse advance decline continues to steam ahead as if nothing is amiss and the mclellan summation index rasi has jumped back into positive territory so both of them are signalling that all is well but some indicators are trying to tell us another story the vix is one of them sentiment indicators are also quite high with the s p 500 bullish percent index at 80 a level often associated with tops as well the put call ratio overwhelmingly supports calls over puts suggesting that there are few bears around the vix is merely one of a number of indicators it is suggesting caution even as we march higher source www stockcharts com in a bull market the small cap stocks tend to outperform the large caps in a bear market it is the other way around but the s p 600 s p 500 ratio peaked way back in june september 2018 since then it has been falling indicating that the large cap s p 500 is outperforming the small cap s p 600 that is what one would have expected in the latter part of 2018 when the trade wars mini bear fell into a sharp low in december 2018 since the market has largely been on a tear in 2019 one would have expected the small caps to lead the way but not so fast despite the s p 500 being at record levels the s p 600 remains well off its all time highs seen in august 2018 the ratio is at the lowest level seen since 2011 back then both the 500 and 600 were falling as the eu greek debt crisis was underway we view this ratio as a sign that something is amiss and the s p 500 s lofty heights are not sustainable source www stockcharts com the u s and china may be signing their first phase of a new trade deal but the baltic dry index bdi has been falling sharply since peaking back in september since then the index has fallen 69 the baltic dry index is a proxy for dry dock shipping stocks and general shipping so it is reflective of global trade a falling bdi indicates a slowing of global trade note that all the previous declines coincided with various crises and also coincidently with a decline in the stock market even if it was delayed the stock market may be rising but the bdi is telling us that it may not be rising for much longer source www haver com www rosenbergresearch com we loved this chart from david rosenberg chief economist and strategist of rosenberg research and associates mr rosenberg tweeted the chart recently econoguyrosie mr rosenberg defines this chart as a modified ny fed model the model has receded sharply from the 80 level seen in the summer 2019 it is now sub 50 all of this increases the odds that a recession could come sooner rather than later source www shadowstats com it s that time of month and the u s job numbers are out the nonfarm payrolls for december saw a gain of 145 000 vs a gain of 256 000 in november it was expected the number would drop because much of the november number was seasonal the market however did expect a gain of 165 000 so it was a small disappointment most of the job gains were in the services sector manufacturing employment fell 12 000 the unemployment rate u3 was 3 5 vs 3 54 the u6 unemployment rate u3 discouraged workers unemployed less than one year marginally attached workers seeking full time was 6 72 vs 6 85 the shadow stats www shadowstats com unemployment rate was 20 8 vs 20 9 shadow stats is u6 discouraged workers unemployed over one year and defined out of the labour force in 1994 the civilian participation rate was unchanged at 63 2 as was the civilian population employment ratio of 61 of the 145 000 jobs created 243 000 were in the private sector while the public sector lost 98 000 the official unemployed was 5 8 million the same as the previous month the actual unemployed is 10 6 million the labour force size remained largely unchanged at 164 6 million not in labour force was also largely unchanged at 95 6 million of that 54 2 million are retirees and 10 0 million are disabled numbers show that 36 7 million live in poverty and 28 2 million are without health insurance wage growth this past year was 2 9 a level below expectations as the previous month was 3 1 it s the slowest wage growth in 18 months 27 million are part time workers some 17 of the workforce while the u s services sector remains robust the manufacturing sector has been declining for months the outlook for 2020 is slower growth but the u s is forecast to lead the g7 as the eu and the u k remain moribund canada is slowing and japan never picked up trade will again dominate as most agree that while the u s and china are signing a first phase this coming week it is largely non effective numbers show that u s consumers and farmers have been paying a price for trump s trade wars china is also negatively impacted as exports have slowed canada employment change and unemployment rate source www tradingeconomics com canada bounced back from november s poor job numbers with a gain in december of 32 500 jobs this helped erase the sharp drop in november of 71 200 jobs the unemployment rate yo yoed back down to 5 6 after leaping to 5 9 the previous month the participation rate remained largely unchanged at 65 6 a level higher than the u s that helps explain why canada s unemployment rate is higher than the u s s because the more people participating helps raise the unemployment rate of the jobs created 38 400 were full time while part time fell 5 900 however the bulk of the jobs were in accommodation and food services suggesting they were not high paying jobs most of the jobs added were in ontario and quebec with other provinces suffering losses some 200 000 jobs have been created in 2019 some 80 full time canada s unemployment rate has been on a downward trajectory for the past three years however the rate of growth for employment is slowing and potentially bodes poorly going into 2020 source www stockcharts com as with the u s indices the tsx composite made new all time highs this past week it was a laboured new high as divergences are appearing on the charts between the price action and the indicators the tsx composite is also at the top of what may be an ascending wedge triangle the breakdown point is roughly coinciding with the 50 day ma a breakdown under 16 900 would most likely send the tsx down to test the still rising 200 day ma near 16 550 under that level and especially under 15 950 a bear market could get underway the tsx gained a healthy 19 1 in 2019 however when looking at the sub indices the story is more mixed with some sub indices performing very well while others performed poorly leading the way in 2019 was information technology and telecommunications both up a robust 60 2 at the other end health care was down 11 1 while energy gained but only 5 9 using the old theory of dogs of the dow one might consider looking at health care and energy stocks for 2020 while being very cautious on info tech and telecommunications some sectors just kept on rising right into year end besides info tech both utilities up 31 6 in 2019 and industrials up 24 7 in 2019 were also rising making new all time highs as we swung into 2020 other sectors seem to be forming distribution tops so some caution is advised for income trusts 23 7 consumer discretionary 13 6 consumer staples 11 4 and financial services 16 9 some sectors are rising coming out of bear markets or rising in a steady manner suggesting that more gains are possible these sectors are real estate 17 4 golds 40 0 metals mining 21 7 and materials 22 1 these sectors may act as a buffer for the tsx composite although the heavy weighting of financials could drag the tsx down source www stockcharts com bond yields continue to wiggle their way higher since making a low in september 2019 at 1 47 the pressure has been to the upside rising interest rates are cited as one of the prime reasons the fed embarked on the repo program rising interest rates in a debt laden world could cause considerable problems i e defaults we continue to believe that the purpose of the repo program is because of financial problems in the banking system our suspicion falls on the eu banking system led by deutsche bank still the repo program has had similar effects as another round of qe or qe4 as it is being called since september 2019 the fed has added 389 6 billion to its balance sheet bringing it to 4 149 5 billion at the current rate of add the fed could add between 1 0 trillion to 1 2 trillion to its balance sheet by august 2020 that s a lot of funds the interest rate rise remains intact but it has been a choppy rise the u s 10 year treasury note does not break out until it is over 2 00 then the rise could begin to accelerate a break back under 1 70 could suggest a test of the september low a falling u s dollar could help push u s interest rates higher while the 10 year might waffle around for a while longer and even test down to 1 70 we suspect that once that move is finished another rise should get underway recession watch spread source www stockcharts com our closely watched 2 10 spread u s 2 year treasury note less the u s 10 year treasury note was flat on the week at 27 bp another spread we watch is the 3 month treasury bill 10 year treasury note spread it was at 29 bp this past week also roughly unchanged on the week the 2 10 spread has been climbing since september when it hit a low of negative 4 bp the 3m 10 spread hit a low of negative 52 bp at the same time a negative yield curve is supposed to be a precursor to a recession however as we have pointed out the negative yield curve comes first and then the curve reverts to positive once again it is when it turns positive once again that the odds of a recession rise the fastest could a recession hit this year the simple answer is yes but the more complex answer is maybe maybe not not this year anyway but 2021 a shock to the system could swiftly change the picture a shock would be outbreak of war that causes oil prices to rise sharply or a major default source www stockcharts com given all the geopolitical noise in the background this past week the u s dollar acted as a bit of safe haven gold did better and rose 0 6 on the week major currencies were weaker with the euro down 0 3 the swiss franc flat the u k pound sterling down 0 2 and the japanese yen off a sharp 1 3 the canadian dollar fell 0 5 after breaking down from a triangular pattern back on december 11 2019 the us index fell to a low of 96 02 before the current rebound got underway we note what appears to be a 5 wave decline from the high of 98 50 seen at the end of november if correct then this is a corrective upward wave that could have a bit more upside to resistance near 97 50 above 97 50 further gains are possible a breakdown once again under 96 50 could set up a break of the recent low of 96 02 further potential is for the us index to fall to the next major level of support near 95 ultimate targets could be down to 90 source www stockcharts com the week s geopolitical events sent gold soaring to new 52 week highs as it peaked out at 1 613 then fell back to earth when tensions appeared to have eased still it closed higher on the week by 0 5 silver by contrast lost a small 0 3 platinum was also down but only a small 0 4 palladium soared once again to another record high closing at 2 072 and gaining 6 0 on the week it is the first time palladium has been over 2 000 palladium is being driven higher by supply shortages gold achieved what we considered to be our first target zone of 1 605 this past week so in that respect a pullback was somewhat expected the problem was it achieved the target in overnight trading a persistent rsi that had reached over 80 suggested that gold was due for at least a technical correction if this is as we suspect then gold should hold key levels it is important to stay above 1 490 1 500 on any pullback a breakdown under that level could suggest a move down to 1 450 and lower a breakdown under 1 425 would be considered potentially terminal regaining back above 1 610 would tell us that we are going higher although we suspect we could get some consolidation here before another assault at higher prices in following the gold community forecasts for gold are invariably bullish to super bullish although we do read some negative reports even dire negative ones with gold falling back below 1 000 that would kill the gold mining market given fundamentals we don t believe that is plausible at this time still it has been only 6 7 months since gold broke out of a multi year bottom formation over 1 370 so we believe it is unlikely to be over in such a short period of time we have minimum objectives up to at least 1 725 but we are wary and aware of 1 425 as a line in the sand the breakout over 1 370 coupled with fresh 52 week highs at 1 613 suggest to us that the current up cycle remains in place we are well aware that the 23 25 year cycle low is due somewhere around 2023 2024 in the interim we could see new all time highs before gold falls into its major cycle low we have achieved at least minimum objectives for this up cycle however given a weakening global economy the negative geopolitical news the potential for a major default in a debt laden world the u s impeachment crisis and the looming election we could be in for a volatile year source www stockcharts com gold in canadian dollars gained 1 this past week hitting new all time highs in the process gold in cad peaked at 2 101 surpassing the high of 2 067 seen back in august 2019 volume was high still gold in cad closed some 64 off its high in what was a very volatile week we d be concerned if gold in cad fell back under 1 960 a breakdown could be underway if gold in cad fell under 1 890 first support comes around 2 020 as we have often noted gold making new all time highs in a host of currencies that includes not only cad but also euros swiss francs and japanese yen suggests that at some point gold should also make a new all time high in u s dollars the u s dollar has been high but as we note we believe it is in the early throes of a breakdown source www cotpricecharts com the gold commercial cot improved this past week to 27 from 26 short open interest fell by roughly 11 000 contracts while long open interest was flat the large speculators cot hedge funds managed futures etc fell to 86 from 88 that should help ease some of the bullish speculation but overall the commercial cot remains bearish we are reminded however that throughout the rise in gold prices from 2008 to 2011 the commercial cot became increasingly bearish even as the price rose however today s levels are even lower than they were then we can t tell whether the drop in short open interest was because they covered shorts on the drop or they covered shorts because the market was going up against them maybe a combination of the two source www stockcharts com while gold managed to eke out a gain in a wild week silver did not fare as well and fell by a small 0 3 silver broke firmly out of a triangle pattern on dec 23 2019 and then promptly put on a gain of almost 10 the week s action left silver down 4 from that high the potential target on the triangle breakout is about 20 50 we haven t changed our possible forecast on that one silver appears to have found support at an uptrend line up from the 16 57 low seen on dec 6 2019 a break of 17 75 could suggest further losses down to towards 16 50 the major line in the sand is there at 16 50 we would not want to see silver break that level on the weekly charts silver is on the cusp of a potential major breakout one seen earlier by gold but never confirmed by silver technically we need to see new highs above the recent high of 19 75 to confirm the breakout the breakout has potential measuring implications for silver to reach to 29 30 but that is premised on silver not breaking back under 16 50 and especially under 16 silver never got as overbought as gold did at the recent high and that should help it going forward with a gold silver ratio of 86 silver remains exceptionally cheap compared to gold a more reasonable longer term average since 2000 would be for the ratio to be around 63 if that level prevailed today silver prices would be closer to 25 the ratio of silver to gold in the earth s crust is estimated at 17 5 1 in roman times it was set at 12 1 and when the u s was constituted the gold silver ratio was set by law at 15 1 not to get silver aficionados too excited but that would translate into a silver price today of 104 source www cotpricecharts com the silver commercial cot improved slightly this past week to 30 from 29 considering the kind of week it was its improvement came as a surprise irrespective of this overall it remains somewhat bearish long open interest rose roughly 2 000 contracts while short open interest fell about 4 000 contracts the large speculators curbed their bullish position to 72 from 74 the silver commercial cot remains bearish but the improvement is welcome source www stockcharts com despite a positive week for gold and only a small decline for silver the gold stocks failed to respond as a wave of nervous profit taking took hold the tsx gold index tgd fell 1 7 on the week while the gold bugs index hui took it even harder down 3 0 despite the weakness we are not discouraged if the breakout seen back on december 24 2019 is correct then this pullback is merely a test of the breakout line it is noteworthy that the tgd pull right back to the breakout line and also the uptrend line from the lows seen in may 2019 friday s rebound after the swift decline on wednesday came right on schedule in that respect follow through to the upside is important now a breakdown under 245 for the tgd would not however be positive as it could lead to further declines important support comes in at 225 and under that level a bear market could follow it is noteworthy that volume fell off on the decline this week suggesting that this was corrective sentiment however is getting high as the gold miners bullish percent index bpgdm is currently at a lofty 84 although down from a recent high at 88 that is as high as we have seen it since the index hit a 100 back in july 2016 the bpgdm has a history of failure between 85 and 95 and hitting a 100 in 2016 was a rarity it was the highest the index ever reached in its short history since 2008 by contrast the index hit zero in december 2015 and that proved to be the low sentiment does play a role and the gold market has a tendency to hit extremes both bullish and bearish currently the index sits in a good place as most indicators are neutral here rsi a benign 53 even at the recent top the indicators were not overly bullish say compared to gold itself gold stocks remain especially cheap compared to the price of gold and indications are they remain a positive accumulation source www stockcharts com it s up no it s down oil prices went on a wild ride this past week with wti oil hitting a peak of 65 65 on fears of a huge escalation in the iran u s conflict then when it appeared that the conflict would end with a whimper rather than a bang wti oil collapsed to 59 15 that was all in one day on january 8 2020 and with that fear of war subsided and thoughts of a global oil glut returned in its place will this last not likely geopolitical risk premium is more likely to return than disappear it is noteworthy that wti oil fell back to an uptrend line so we can say that if wti oil were to fall through 58 then there could be further losses seen a breakdown under 57 has the potential to return oil to a bear market to keep the bull alive we d need a return back above 61 that could spark further gains wti oil wound up down 6 4 on the week quite dramatic considering all that was going on natural gas ng recouped a little up 3 3 on the week but overall ng remains in the dumpster the energy stocks ended the week mixed or maybe confused is the word the arca oil gas index xoi ended down 0 4 while the tsx energy index ten eked out a gain of 0 3 the xoi appears to have hit a barrier just under 1 300 a breakout over 1 300 would spark further gains the ten s resistance is at 150 a breakout over that level would also spark further gains for those looking for higher oil prices it is imperative that geopolitical concerns rule the day otherwise forecasts of tepid global growth of 2 5 world bank are more likely to see oil prices staying suppressed due to excess supply and withering demand the world bank in its forecast for global gdp growth cited the unprecedented runup in debt worldwide it is not merely charlatans expressing alarm over the size of global debt emerging market debt grew to 170 of gdp in 2018 up from 115 in 2010 here in canada alberta oil continues to have major problems as prices fell again relative to wti oil alberta s problems are many and they may be forced into cuts again to help maintain the price this past year there was the largest amount of oil and gas discoveries in four years some 12 2 billion barrels of oil were found including 26 of at least 100 million barrels as we noted withering demand and rising supply unless of course the shooting war starts up again an event which is likely chart of the week source www macrotrends net ever wonder how long it takes a market to recover after a bear market the most recent bear market that effectively lasted from 2000 to 2009 only took 13 years to recover its former level our chart of the dow jones industrials dji inflation adjusted shows that by 2013 the dji had regained its 2000 level that was actually quite good by comparison it took the dji 34 years to recoup the 1929 high 1929 1963 for what seemed to be for good the dji actually hit the former high mark a few years earlier in 1959 30 years but it failed to hold it finally left the 1929 high behind in 1963 but the celebration was short lived as the market topped out in february 1966 it then took another 29 years to 1995 before the market recovered the 1966 top it wasn t until 1991 that the market recovered the 1929 high once again and then it took another four years to recoup the 1966 high you put it all together and on an inflation adjusted basis the market took 66 years 1929 1995 to fully recover that s a lifetime for some people we recognize that everyone did not buy the 1929 high but then again everyone did not buy the 1932 low either so should we get excited that this time it only took 13 years to recover the 2000 high well yes and no because as we know the market over the past ten years has been driven by historically low interest rates qe1 2 and 3 and now some are calling it qe4 plus the biggest debt binge in human history central banks printing money with the fed alone inflating its balance sheet 500 over the past decade have translated into a sharply rising stock market but one that is built on quicksand eventually the ability to add more debt and print money runs out the question is always when

the perspective atlanta georgia january 13 2020 the effort in part i called usaid awards 16m to nathan to fight corruption but says nothing about the 66 fraudulent concessionary agreements and illegal wealth accumulation was to question the idea that usaid and other foreign experts are training incompetent inefficient and lazy liberian employees in order to reduce corruption and the cycle of violence i think these views are wrong rather usaid and others should not only question why some elected leaders are gullible to corruption but also should analyze their own purpose of existence for example are usaid and other ordinary trainers assistants or are they agents of principals i e countries which are searching for resources on the cheap if no employee is inherently incompetent or inefficient then certainly liberian employees are no exception on the other hand since usaid and others are merely implementors of the missions of their principals wouldn t it be a good idea to look beyond the policies of these agents why look at the interest of the principals this is because any country i e which is a principal of an agent for example the united states of america is a competitor within the economic global arena it is a competitor in search of cheap natural resources in search of a regular supply of unskilled labor to work at slave wage plantation companies such as liberian firestone rubber plantation company for instance did the world bank one of liberia s economic advisers and usaid oppose the interest of the united states of america during the recent re negotiation of firestone concessionary agreements to continue to produce tires in dayton ohio america no because the tire factory in dayton ohio employs a significant number of us citizens and were liberia to add values to latex i e for example to manufacture tires in liberia domestic revenue will increase but dayton ohio tire factory would not get latex from liberia adding values to the latex would generate additional revenue for liberia however adding values would require an investment in liberia s education which would reduce the number of unskilled labor needed to tap latex for the dayton ohio tire factory the million dollar question is did the world bank and or usaid advocate for more unskilled workforce or advocate for educational policy that would reduce the number of unskilled labor certainly usaid and the world bank did nothing to undermine the interest of the dayton tire factory to get latex from liberia and produce tires if liberia should move ahead stakeholders should re evaluate liberia s relationship with its competitors and the different agents of our nation state i am forwarding a few of my inputs for review and critical analysis gold or special drawing rights i e a privilege to borrow money adding gold and reducing special drawing rights might reduce the need for liberia to borrow money from the imf an arrangement that might reduce imf s revenue importantly such an economic arrangement might not only reduce liberia s debt but also it could calm the fear of foreign suppliers because the central bank does not have money to refund or repay the debt owed by local merchants gold values which price is to hit 1 650 in 2020 can be exchanged and or sold for values further an increase i e by adding gold in our country s net international foreign exchange reserves would reduce the prices of goods and services in liberia liberia s unemployment rate at 3 the 2015 survey by usaid reported that liberia s unemployment rate is around 3 this number is wrong because it includes school age boys and girls and rural residents who live on subsistence farming unfortunately this favorable percentage is encouraging money lending institutions into believing that liberian consumers buying power is high since 97 percent of the population is employed i surmise that is part of the reason why small businesses are not paying their loans because the low unemployment number indicated that their business would be profitable worse money lending institutions have and continue to encourage liberia s school age children to abandon communities of education religion and culture and are now obligated and committed to the cutthroat community of fast money making activities review factors used in computing the denominator nominal gross domestic products the imf and the world bank have advised liberian officials to use nominal gross domestic product which values are usually higher than the values of real gross domestic products to compute 1 debt to gdp ratio 2 budgetary shortfall 3 income per capital 4 national debt to gross revenue ratio etc for example the liberian government to reduce its debt to gdp ratio from 35 in 2017 to 26 in 2018 the low number indicated that liberia could borrow more money thereafter government officials and the imf reported that the government had more room to borrow more money because liberia s debt to gdp ratio was 26 far below the benchmark of 38 if the rise and falls in inflation i e prices should account for the difference between real gross domestic product and nominal gross domestic products where are the factors to account for the 9 decrease how did the imf reported us 3b as the nominal gross domestic product in 2017 if real gross domestic product in 2017was less than 1b according to the 2018 annual report of the central bank the percentage of 200 i e 3b minus 1b is equaled 2b increase which is divided by 1b is far above the 2018 inflationary rate of 25 predictably the imf likes the 26 because liberia is perceived to be in a position to borrow more money budgetary document revenue projection the ministry of finance development and planning stated that liberia s economy is bad yet its revenue projection numbers in 2016 2017 are not significantly different from the revenue projection numbers in subsequent years including 2020 2021 i guess it wants a higher revenue projection in order to borrow more money from the liberian central bank the 1999 central bank act stipulates that the liberian government should not borrow more than 5 of the total liberian gross national revenue however gol can borrow more money from the central bank if its revenue projection is higher than the actual projection unearned revenue the liberian revenue authority central bank of liberia and others should prepare a schedule of reconciliation detailing earned income and unearned income if not available a schedule of reconciliation would help policymakers to understand that a portion of the government s deposits at the central bank represents projected revenue for the previous fiscal period or subsequent fiscal period this schedule is even important since the central bank reports on a calendar basis while the government prepares its budget on the fiscal year july 1 through june 30 buy used vehicles and re used vehicles liberian government should buy durable used vehicles apply generally accepted accounting principles isa 16 and end the selling of government vehicles at book value officials are selling government s vehicles after a few years in operation because the vehicles have reached their threshold i e may be set at 500 or 10 000 over which it depreciates as assets re using vehicles would reduce our budgetary deficit and by extension reduce interest rates and increase poor people s purchasing power financial capital market if a liberian financial market is to be useful for trading our central bank should ensure that 1 businesses should publish financial data such as revenue projection earnings per share debt to assets ratio prices of short term and long term bonds assets liabilities equity etc 2 underwriters consultants should evaluate a business s initial offering price 3 independent rating agencies should appraise and assign grades aaa bbb etc to bonds stocks 4 create or encourage private capitalists to establish financial institutions similar to institutions such as bloomberg llc and new york stock exchange which are equip and capable to provide trading platforms and 5 security exchange commission monitors and regulates trading domestic revenue mobilization reduce utility cost by encouraging them to publish financial statements institute measures to increase the buying power of consumers since more cash in the hands of consumers would result in an increase in tax revenue for instance accountability and transparency in the form of publishing financial statements usually result in increasing cash savings of customers therefore government should require both public and private utility providers to publish their financial statements in accordance with section 2 5 of the september 16 2010 freedom of information act decentralize government administration office buildings across the fifteen counties this approach would reduce the cost of housing rent expense thereby allowing tenants to use their cash savings from exorbitant rent to buy other goods and services which will increase tax revenue agriculture the engine of economy let us not allow the world food program and the international monetary fund to dictate our agricultural program the idea put forward by the imf that a government should not play a role in our agriculture is ill advised because western countries are playing a role in their agriculture for instance if the government agent i e the world food program did not purchase the excess food produced by farmers in western countries and ship the excess food to poor countries those farmers would not be profitable why farmers would not profitable every year farmers produce more food than customers in those countries demand for which would force the price of food to drop below a profitable price in order to keep the price of food at a profitable price for farmers in western countries the world food program purchases the excess food and ships the excess to poor countries the government should investigate pre 1980 policies of the agricultural cooperative development bank acdb and review reasons if any why many entrepreneurs do not borrow money to produce food for example commercial banks appropriated l 72b loan for entrepreneurs in 2018 and cbl allocated us 5m to agriculture in 2018 also the government should serve food at government ceremonies which might have the effect of increased production this initiative might encourage the public to consume more and by extension increase the consumption of local food if liberians begin to become real accountable transparent and honest it might be difficult for agents and or liberia s competitors to deceive and dictate liberia s policy and by extension our destiny by j yanqui zaza
fitch ratings terms pakistan s financial outlook stable business fitch ratings terms pakistan s financial outlook stable external vulnerabilities of country have been reduced over the past year as a result of policy actio 13 january 2020 04 37 pm islamabad dunya news american credit rating agency fitch ratings on monday issued rating with regard to pakistan s economy and affirmed a b status with a stable outlook according to fitch ratings the b rating reflects a challenging external position characterised by a high external financing requirement and low reserves weak public finances including large fiscal deficits and a high government debt to gdp ratio and weak governance indicators progress is being made towards strengthening external finances and positive steps have been made on the fiscal front but considerable risks remain external vulnerabilities have been reduced over the past year as a result of policy actions by the authorities and financing unlocked through an imf programme which have narrowed the current account deficit and supported a modest rebuilding of reserves still external finances remain fragile with relatively low foreign exchange reserves in the context of an elevated external debt repayment schedule and subdued export performance pakistan s liquidity ratio is 111 4 much weaker than the historic b median of 161 2 fitch forecasts a further narrowing of the current account deficit to 2 1 of gdp in the year ending june 2020 fy20 and 1 9 in fy21 from 4 9 in the last fiscal year import compression remains the predominant driver of the narrowing deficit facilitated by a depreciation of the rupee against the us dollar of around 30 since december 2017 and tighter monetary conditions exports are forecast to grow modestly from a low base the state bank of pakistan s sbp adoption of a more flexible exchange rate last may and capital inflows are also supporting a rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves fitch expects gross liquid foreign exchange reserves rise to around usd11 5 billion by fye20 from usd7 2 billion at fye19 the sbp has also reduced its net forward position by over usd3 billion since june contributing to a considerable improvement in its net foreign exchange reserves although these remain negative we expect continued adherence to the new exchange rate regime to help rebuild foreign exchange reserves and improve external resilience access to external financing has improved after the approval of a usd6 billion 39 month extended fund facility eff by the imf board in july 2019 according to the imf this has potentially unlocked about usd38 billion in financing from multilateral including from the imf and bilateral sources over the programme period it may also facilitate financing from offshore capital markets the eff is on track with the first review completed in december however implementation risks remain high in fitch s view particularly given the politically challenging nature of the authorities reform agenda gross external financing needs are likely to remain high in the mid usd20 billion range over the medium term due to considerable debt repayments and despite the smaller current account deficit sustaining inflows to meet these financing needs could prove challenging over a longer horizon without stronger export growth and net fdi inflows public finances are a key credit weakness and deteriorated further in fy19 prior to the approval of the imf programme the general government deficit slipped to 8 9 of gdp in fy19 from 6 5 in fy18 as revenues contracted due in part to one off factors such as lower sbp dividends and delayed telecom licence renewals general government debt rose to 84 8 of gdp well above the current b median of 54 due to the currency depreciation higher fiscal deficit and build up of liquidity buffers debt revenue also jumped sharply to 667 compared with the historic b median of 252 the government is consolidating public finances but fitch believes progress will be challenging due to the relatively high reliance on revenues to achieve the planned adjustment fitch believes the revenue target in the fy20 budget is ambitious nevertheless the government s efforts to broaden the tax base through its tax filer documentation drive and removal of gst exemptions will contribute to stronger revenue growth in the current fiscal year the passage of the public financial management act should improve fiscal discipline by limiting the use of supplementary budgets the government has also taken steps to improve federal provincial level fiscal coordination through its fiscal coordination council as the provinces play a key role in the fiscal structure fitch forecasts the fiscal deficit to decline to 7 9 of gdp in fy20 based on a reversal of the previous year s one off factors and revenue enhancing measures this is slightly higher than the government s expectations of 7 5 due to our more conservative revenue projections we expect expenditure to rise particularly as interest servicing costs increase sharply on the back of higher interest rates we project interest payments general government revenues of 45 in fy20 well above the historic peer median of 8 6 we forecast general government debt to gdp will fall to about 80 by end fy21 due to faster nominal gdp growth and fiscal consolidation the government has taken steps to manage domestic debt rollover risks following the cessation of borrowing from the sbp under the eff in particular the government has reprofiled its sbp debt stock into longer tenor instruments and has sought to lengthen maturities by issuing longer term domestic bonds the government still has roughly 17 of gdp in upcoming domestic maturities in fy20 compared with the b median of 6 but has built up its cash buffer to partly mitigate rollover risk tighter macroeconomic policies are further slowing gdp growth which fitch forecasts at 2 8 in fy20 from 3 3 in fy19 we expect growth to recover gradually to 3 4 by fy21 inflation has also continued to rise sharply from the cost pass through of the currency depreciation and increases in energy tariffs fitch forecasts inflation to average 11 3 in fy20 compared with 6 8 in fy19 the sbp is likely to keep the policy rate at the current peak of 13 25 in the coming months before modest cuts towards the end of fy20 as inflationary pressures begin to fade improvements to the business and security environment could further support the growth outlook domestic security has improved over the past couple of years measured by a decline in terrorist incidents nevertheless ongoing international perceptions of security risks and geopolitical tensions with neighbouring countries weigh on investor sentiment the government has also made progress on business reforms reflected in the country s move from 136th to 108th in the world bank s latest ease of doing business survey pakistan s rating is constrained by structural weaknesses reflected in weak development and governance indicators per capita gdp of usd1 382 is below the usd3 470 median of its b rated peers governance quality is also low in pakistan with a world bank governance indicator score in the 22nd percentile while the b median is in the 38th percentile

2020 year to date sek is the worst performing g10 currency and while local equity markets have offered generous returns sweden s financial system is growing increasingly fragile policymakers are growing increasingly concerned it could devolve into a full blown financial crisis but in order to understand why it is imperative to look at riksbank monetary policy the explosion of debt and the fundamental outlook for the european economy against the backdrop of global geopolitics together these pieces create a mosaic albeit a relatively gloomy one on why i am bearish on the swedish krona and sweden s equity market heading into 2020 amid the u s china trade war and other peripheral trade conflicts between emerging market economies global manufacturing pmi has slid into contractionary territory in europe the three biggest eurozone economies germany france and italy continue to slow amid waning inter regional demand against the backdrop of global deceleration a big point of focus in europe in addition to brexit and italy s precarious finances is the german economy dubbed the steam engine of europe as the largest economy in the eurozone fluctuations in the country s growth patterns has an iterated effect across various member states in this regard germany is a power node of economic activity within a regional hub that constitutes one of three major pillars in the global economy export oriented economies surrounding the region like norway and sweden are therefore useful bellwethers to monitor because they strongly rely on demand from the mainland primarily germany nordic producers may continue to scale back their production in anticipation that the current level of supply will not be there to meet the demand this may then be reflected in weaker readings in diffusion indices like pmi data source world trade atlas source world trade atlas industrial reports in particular typically get hit first when global sentiment shifts to either growth positive or pessimistic in early october sweden had its weakest manufacturing pmi print since the eurozone debt crisis and before that it was the 2008 great recession the fact that this reading is within this territory in and of itself is telling and alarming even more worryingly the composite index is also in contractionary territory source created by author using data from bloomberg terminal this come as the european central bank has recently cut interest rates further into negative territory the deposit rate is now 0 50 and the ecb has reintroduced its bond purchasing program in an effort to boost inflation however upward movement in price growth is not looking good with the 5y5y euro inflation swap forward only recently recovering from its all time low at 1 1688 this is particularly worrisome for the riksbank which only recently exited negative interest rates territory and is now in an environment of slower growth and waning demand out of a key trading partner markets have doubted the central bank s ability to raise rates in 2019 and the krona has suffered for it according to the bloomberg terminal world currency ranker indicator sek was the worst performing g10 currency in 2019 here is where the overlapping effect of riksbank monetary policy on the swedish krona and local equity markets comes in ultra loose credit conditions have incentivized local borrowers to incur a significant amount of debt since the cost of money is so low the average debt to income ratio in sweden hovers around 330 with some high as high 600 to put it another way for every krona swedes earn they owe on average 3 30 kroner in debt payments most of these are tied to mortgages this helps explain why swedish housing prices have skyrocketed with the ubs real estate bubble index showing sweden as the only country in bubble territory outpacing paris milan san francisco singapore and geneva source created by author using data from bloomberg terminal riksbank policymakers have noticed the high level of household indebtedness and have urged local politicians to adopt macroprudential measures to counter the rising risk officials are concerned that slower economic growth and weakening financial conditions may not allow swedes to refinance their debt and that higher unemployment and weaker consumption could put the fragile housing market at risk the key catalyst may not just be a global slowdown but a regional downturn in mainland europe eu u s trade tensions are already strained which is being amplified by the wto dispute over boeing and airbus and the recent threats of tariffs amid france s digital tax law softer cross border sales out of sweden s export driven economy may then hurt consumption job growth and the ability of swede s to service their mortgages the concern is that an inter bank contagion effect might take place to the numerous financial institutions that are exposed to these mortgages the effect would likely leave the swedish krona and local equity markets in the red if prevailing uncertainty about the strength of the financial system is put into doubt this is not an unfamiliar pattern it already occurred 10 years ago only its origin was in the u s not sweden traders may take advantage of the ethereal market optimism about the prospect of a u s china trade resolution and an improved fundamental outlook by finding an optimal technical point to position their short trades as demand for the u s dollar abroad continues to rise and will likely be amplified in the case of a downturn as traders shift their focus from returns to liquidity

highs amid renewed hope about u s china trade relations following the outcome of the market friendly uk election if sweden s debt problems spiral out of control it could cause the benchmark index to

when the u s presidential election will be under way the effect of political uncertainty may also be magnified by concerns about brexit and the uk s ability to establish a trade deal before the end of 2020 adding onto that is the concern that softer growth out of europe will weigh on sweden s export oriented economy and further undermine the riksbank s intention of holding rates for the next few years swedish policymakers will be paying particularly close attention to consumer confidence as it continues to slide into areas not touched since the eurozone debt crisis and the 2008 financial crash before that
the origins of the labour party unlike most of its european counterparts the british labour party was not created by people calling themselves socialists it was set up by the trade unions to act in the interest of those unions in fact in its early days it made no claim to being a socialist party at all we would claim that in fact it has never been a socialist party to understand just why labour has never been a socialist party it is a good idea to go right back to its roots the labour party was officially formed in 1906 but its origins really lie back in the 1850s with the creation of the first successful trade unions in britain britain was the first capitalist society from the earliest days of capitalism there has been a fierce struggle between the bosses and the workers at times this struggle was industrial with workers trying to set up types of unions the first we know of was in the middle of the 17th century at times it was political with workers struggling for democratic rights at times direct action was used with workers destroying machines blowing up factories and burning hayricks until the 1850s the responses of the ruling class was always the same brutal repression was the order of the day workers were sacked imprisoned hanged and deported by the 1850s the capitalist class were firmly established in control of britain the 1832 reform act which altered the way parliament was elected and the abolition of the corn laws in 1846 which introduced free trade in food put the old aristocracy firmly in their place the working class political agitation for the vote had been defeated with the failure of the chartists in 1848 the capitalists could afford to loosen up a bit on their hold on the working class the 1850s saw the first ever successful setting up of trade unions these weren t mass organisations of all workers they were small tightly organised associations of skilled workers craftsmen in the building trades and skilled engineers were the first to get organised these men were quite highly paid and saw themselves as a cut above their fellow workers some might call them an aristocracy of labour they saw themselves as being respectable members of society who wanted nothing to do with notions of revolution it was this social group that was rewarded with the vote in 1867 essentially capitalism realised it had nothing to fear from them these groups were followed by other skilled workers in organising unions they set about creating trades councils and the tuc unskilled workers were kept firmly in their place by the capitalists when agricultural workers tried to organise they were smashed politically these newly unionised and enfranchised workers saw themselves as being part of the liberal tradition it was to the liberal party that they looked for help and it was as liberals that the first working men were elected to parliament in fact this tradition was so strong that even after the labour party was formed a significant group of mps were elected as lib labs that is they were liberal mps but they saw themselves as labour men these lib labs were mostly from mining constituencies in wales in the 1880s the first socialist organisation in britain was formed this was the democratic federation which was soon renamed the social democratic federation this group was never very large and failed to attract much support from the new unions the 1880s also saw the setting up of unions for semi skilled and unskilled workers the first of these was formed during the match girls strike against bryant and may equally significant was the dockers strike and the setting up of the dockers union others soon followed these unions however were firmly under the control not of their members but of supporters and patrons who were either members of the craft unions or were actually members of the ruling class it wasn t until the 1890s that significant groups of workers began to look for independent labour representation in 1893 the independent labour party ilp was set up in bradford its title explained its reason for existence it still failed to gain much support from the existing unions however members of both the sdf and ilp did get themselves elected into important positions in the unions and trades councils the 1880s and 1890s were like the 1980s and 1990s in one way they both saw the coming of a great economic crisis that of the 1880s and 1890s was called the great depression faced with falling profits and declining markets the ruling class hit back against the working class many were sacked others were forced to leave their unions the overall effect was catastrophic for the trades unions this was made even worse by a series of court cases which threatened the finances of the unions the crunch came with the taff vale case in 1901 which said that employers could sue unions for the effects of a strike it was these court cases that persuaded the unions that they needed to get their act together politically faced with financial ruin the tuc agreed to the setting up of a labour representation committee in 1900 its aim was to get independent labour mps elected who would change the law in the unions interests the lrc was a coalition of unions and socialist societies the biggest of which were the ilp and the sdf the sdf soon left when the lrc refused to adopt the politics of class struggle stabbing the working class in the back after the election of 1906 and the winning of 29 seats by the lrc it changed its name to the labour party it wasn t socialist theory which had created the party it was the action of a group of hard headed union leaders who realised that only by winning seats in parliament could they hope to alter the legal balance against themselves this set the tone for the party and ensured that points of principle always had to give way to expediency and horse trading even to get elected these mps had had to do deals in those days many constituencies had two mps ten of the mps were elected in these where the liberal party only put up one candidate sixteen of the others didn t have to put up with liberal opposition only three of them had to fight for their seats against more than just a tory most claimed to be devoutly religious usually methodist or congregationalist only a couple claimed to be marxists so the first group of labour mps were elected on the coat tails of the liberal party as a result of electoral deals and pacts small wonder that there was little difference between the two groups this group of mps achieved little other than state payment of mps in 1911 then in 1914 war broke out between britain and germany the labour party had been part of the second international and as such was supposed to be against war in fact it took them just three days to decide to support the war for revolutionaries and socialists it is a simple principle that we oppose capitalist wars they are always fought in capitalist interests whether to capture new markets to defend trade routes or to grab sources of raw materials they are always said to be for freedom democracy or to defend the rights of small nations these justifications are equally always lies these lies are used to con workers into joining up and dying while the boss class rakes in the profits at times it can be difficult to see this but in 1914 the issues were quite clear socialists in 1914 recognised this in britain and in other countries almost without exception the social democratic and labour parties rushed to support their ruling class against workers in other countries this act clearly marked these parties as being on the side of the bosses and against workers all over the world the grateful capitalist class were quick to reward the labour leaders in may 1915 the liberal prime minister asquith decided that to run the war properly he needed a coalition government arthur henderson the leader of the labour party joined the cabinet and two other labour mps got junior jobs in return they collaborated with the introduction of conscription and the deskilling of industry as the war went on labour s membership of the government increased this involvement in government was at a time of rising class struggle as prices soared food became scarce and wages failed to rise there was an upsurge in class struggle particularly on clydeside many socialists were imprisoned for refusing to join up speakers were beaten up and public meetings had to be cancelled labour s response was to fight to win the war to break strikes and try to exclude from the party the influence of groups like the ilp which tended to take a more pacifist line in 1917 their influence was broken forever by the power of the trade union bureaucrats with the introduction of the union bloc vote it was in 1918 that the party adopted what it claims to be a socialist constitution this was adopted under the influence of the russian revolution and the upsurge of struggle that followed it all over europe in theory it proposed very radical sounding policies in reality it enshrined the unions bureaucrats control of the party the constitution for the first time allowed individual membership of the party thus it let in all sorts of guilt ridden privileged public school types who hoped to run a reformed capitalism in fact it was written by one of them sidney webb it was this constitution that contained the famous clause four this said it was the party s aim to secure for the producers by hand and brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service this doesn t sound too bad on paper now we have something to judge them against instead of just a desire to save union funds from the courts the first two labour governments they soon had a chance to put their ideas into practice in december 1923 there was a general election although the conservatives won most seats they were in a minority labour and the liberals massively outnumbered them as the second largest party labour got the chance to govern this first labour government led by ramsay macdonald only lasted from january to november before being replaced by the tories again they claimed that they were in office but not in power and so couldn t really be blamed for not having done much a good sign of just how much they intended to do and how clear their attachment to socialist principles was can be seen from the following j h thomas union leader and mp was appointed to the colonial office he introduced himself to his departmental heads with the statement i m here to see there is no mucking about with the british empire in february 1924 the dockers called a strike this was opposed by the labour government in march the tramway workers in london came out the railway unions proposed to come out in sympathy macdonald s response was to use the full force of the law on the side of the bosses he invoked the 1920 emergency powers act this would have meant the declaration of a state of emergency if the strike had not been called off in august the attorney general tried to prosecute j r campbell the editor of the communist workers weekly on a charge of incitement to mutiny these actions all helped set the tone for the future other notable labour victories of this government were to go ahead with rearmament including the building of five new cruisers the bombing of indigenous people in iraq and shooting strikers in india presumably for mucking about with the british empire just six years after adopting its so called socialist constitution labour had had a chance at government it had acted like any other capitalist party for the bosses and against the workers labour got elected again in 1929 again it was a minority government it promised to reduce unemployment which stood at 1 164 000 within a year it had gone up by 750 000 to 1 911 000 in two years it had more than doubled reaching the then record level of 2 707 000 faced with drain of gold from london in 1931 the government discussed ways to save the pound what this meant was cuts in civil service pay and unemployment benefits the cabinet split over this and macdonald the ilp member formed a coalition with liberals and tories to force the measures through the majority of the party went into opposition in the two years labour had been in power 4 million workers had had their wages reduced including the government s own employees what followed was a period in the wilderness with continued tory government the party came under the leadership and control of two men clement attlee and sir stafford cripps both were members of the ruling class attlee was the son of a solicitor who had gone to public school during the first world war this famous socialist and ilp member had been a major in the army he had tried to enlist just two days after the war started but had been refused because he was too old undaunted he kept on trying and had on a number of occasions considered shooting men for cowardice when war broke out in 1939 labour were quick to support the british ruling class in fact attlee s biggest concern in the early days of september was that chamberlain the tory pm wouldn t declare war on germany in 1940 attlee got his reward labour entered into coalition with the tories and attlee and greenwood got into the war cabinet attlee s first job was to introduce an emergency powers bill which gave the government the power to control every aspect of life he went on the bbc to announce that parliament has given to the government full power to control all persons and property the direction of persons to perform services will be under the minister of labour mr ernest bevin like the first world war the second brought increased prices and lowered standards of living to workers like in the first workers didn t just accept this there were strikes in many industries most notably in the mines as labour and the tuc were partners in the capitalists war effort their response was simple strikers were saboteurs and enemies they must return to work everything was to be subordinate to the war effort workers must wait till the war was over the attlee government with the end of the war in europe july 1945 saw another general election this time labour won with a huge majority they had 393 mps out of 640 they could do anything that they liked they finally had the chance to really do something and put clause four into effect what they did was nationalise great swathes of industry notably coal rail gas electricity iron and steel and the bank of england they also introduced the national health service and other features of the welfare state it is upon this that most labour members rest their claims of socialism looking back we can clearly see that nationalisation has nothing to do with socialism all it does is replace one set of bosses with another set who work for the state for workers the old problems remain we still have to work for a wage or salary we still have to pay the rent or mortgage we still have to feed and clothe our kids we do this while the new bosses live lives of luxury on enormous salaries we have no control over our own lives and constantly face the prospect of the sack all over the world workers have rejected state capitalism why did labour nationalise all these industries they did so mostly because they were not making profits for their bosses after the war and the pre war experiences of the great depression british capitalism was in a bad way industry was crumbling and needed replacing industry that had been destroyed in the war needed rebuilding if private capital remained tied up in the loss making mines and railways it could not be used to reconstruct british capitalism the obvious answer was to nationalise in return for their ownership of particular firms the ruling class were given lavish compensation which could then be invested in other more profitable industries a good example of this was with the nationalisation of the bank of england stockholders were guaranteed the right to continue to receive a 12 dividend on their investment even after the bank was taken into state ownership workers on the other hand according to herbert morrison could only get the benefits of social insurance by increasing the total national income it could only be done by work thought drive and initiative times september 6th 1945 what this meant of course was increased productivity greater exploitation to screw more surplus value out of the working class in return for which a few crumbs would be thrown off the bosses table the communist arthur horner a senior num bureaucrat explained that he wanted the workers in the pits to adopt a new attitude hitherto the policy of the union had been to get what they could out of the owners now they had taken on the responsibility of assisting in running the industry they must accept new methods they must take a more active part in assisting greater technical efficiency and increasing output daily telegraph sept 7th 1945 the labour party and the unions were hand in hand with the bosses aiming to screw more out of the working class by conning them that the promised land had arrived they showed just whose side they were on in the docks just like in 1924 labour had to deal with a dockers strike this was in october 1945 the strike was unofficial both union leaders and labour mps told them to go back to work but the men who had suffered big wage cuts after the war ended carried on with their strike what was labour s response they sent troops into the london docks to break the strike they repeated this tactic many times in the course of their government indeed it is a regular feature of labour in power that it uses troops to break strikes it did it in the 1970s against the fire fighters the bin men and others what about the nhs surely this was a great socialist venture actually it was all based on the wartime beveridge report this was partly aimed at keeping workers quiet in the hope of avoiding upheaval after the war it was also partly aimed at ensuring a healthier and more compliant workforce that would produce more profits for the bosses in any case beveridge the great architect of the nhs was a member of the liberal party and his report had the broad agreement of all the main political parties any argument was over points of policy not the policy itself what was labour s record on the nhs in this government they passed a law in 1949 allowing for prescription charges and in 1951 introduced charges on glasses and false teeth other notable features of this labour government were the building of the british atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb the rising of the cost of living by 30 and the demand that workers exercise restraint and not ask for pay rises wartime rationing was kept in place which ensured that money was spent not on consumption but on investment this meant not only less for workers but a drabber more monotonous existence in fact between 1947 and 1951 working class people suffered a drop in their real wages all in all the great attlee government gave little to the working class in this it revealed once again just whose side it was on this time its membership began more closely to reveal this fact too in 1945 more than 40 of the labour mps were lawyers between 20 and 30 were business men and a good sprinkling of farmers accountants consulting engineers and other professions were among the rest arthur greenwood the labour lord privy seal said at the time i look around among my colleagues and i see landlords capitalists and lawyers we are a cross section of the national life and this is something that has never happened before a party originally set up to protect the unions had acquired a constitution written by middle class intellectuals and was now being run by a coalition of union bureaucrats and traditional members of the ruling class nationalisation is not and never has been socialism socialism means the common ownership of the means of production and distribution it means getting rid of the bosses getting rid of working for a wage or salary getting rid of the whole rotten buying and selling system it means that people will freely come together to produce what is needed and will freely take from the abundant products of their labour it will involve the abolition not only of the ruling class but also their state it will not mean that state being replaced by a new state nationalisation is just one form of state capitalism it is hardly surprising that the labour party and the unions ended up as the firmest supporters of state capitalism trade unions do not exist to change society they were set up to fight over the division of the capitalist cake not to take over the bakery indeed without the buying and selling economy based on wage labour there is no role for a trade union with no role for a trade union there is no job for a union official however the power privileges and status of the union bureaucrats are very much determined by how much their status is recognised by the capitalist class to protect their position it is natural for unions to look for a more regulated capitalism a capitalism based on partnership between employers and labour organisations it was to achieve this that the labour party was set up in the first place their position was recognised and they were welcomed as junior partners in the state machine during the first world war it was a logical step for them to go beyond mere regulation and favour full blown state ownership with the state as the major employer working in partnership with the unions thus clause four was adopted as a means of selling this to the working class at the same time as the unions control over the party was established their function as part of the state machine was re emphasised during the second world war and continued afterwards with the various tripartite commissions quangos like the national economic development corporation and the routine appointment of trade union general secretaries to the house of lords as part of the state wanting more state control the party attracted to itself those sections of the ruling class who would benefit from it this helps explain the number of lawyers and other professionals in the attlee governing party by the 1940s even the leaders of the party came from this social group in 1951 there was another general election this time labour lost it was followed by 13 years of tory government the most startling fact about this period is just how similar it was to the previous labour administration there was no privatisation municipal housing programmes increased in speed the welfare state thrived the wilson years 1964 saw the return of yet another labour government again they came to power on the back of promises to the working class it would be pointless to give a detailed account of their practice some high points however deserve mention this period of government saw an almost continual balance of payments crisis accompanied by pressure on sterling and the exchange rate to combat this labour put a freeze on wages but allowed prices to keep on going up at the same time as freezing wages they devalued the pound which of course meant a further falling of wages the working class s response to this was to increase the number of strikes and other methods of industrial struggle most of the most effective strikes were unofficial the government s response was to introduce a white paper in place of strife which attempted to force the unions to police their members better the unions felt unable to do this and resisted the white paper it was later picked up and introduced into law by the heath conservative government as part of their attempt to force austerity on the working class the government introduced nhs prescription charges and the charge for dental treatment increased by half they got rid of free school milk in secondary schools a policy followed up by margaret thatcher under the heath government new taxes were introduced on imported goods which made them more expensive for working class people even holidays were made less pleasant exchange controls were brought in that only allowed people to take 50 with them if they went abroad of course the rich soon found ways round this on immigration labour took the racist path in 1968 a racist regime in kenya threatened to kick thousands of asians out of kenya nearly all of these held british passports labour s response was to pass the commonwealth immigrants act which stopped most of them coming to britain throughout the sixties the labour government supported the usa in its war in vietnam this was at a time when the americans were regularly terror bombing cities napalming villages and massacring civilians labour s foreign policy was crowned by the decision to build the polaris submarine force this came from the party which had adopted unilateralism as its policy at the beginning of the sixties callaghan and the social contract the heath government was beaten when they tried to take on the miners the ruling class were clearly unhappy with the idea of a three day week and showed little enthusiasm for a continuation of his rule in 1974 there was another election and again labour was elected this was the start of the last period of labour government up to today once again there was a balance of payments crisis and to this was added the twin problems of unemployment and inflation true to their past labour chose to tackle inflation they did this with the social contract pay freezes backed by law had proved very unpopular and extremely difficult to enforce faced with unofficial and wildcat strikes labour s alternative was a voluntary scheme which relied on the unions to police their members in fact the whole social contract idea was the scheme of left wing union leaders notable jack jones of the tgwu so in the winter of 1975 76 inflation ran into double figures unemployment rose to unheard of levels and workers were prevented from getting more than 6 a week extra in their pay packets the success of this policy led to even lower pay rises the following year in 1976 the state of british capitalism was so severe that the government called in the international monetary fund imf to arrange a loan they imposed severe austerity measures which callaghan the new pm was only too happy to impose these called for cuts in public expenditure particularly hitting education and health some of the first anti cuts demonstrations were held not against tories but against labour when workers resisted or fought back they were subject to the full range of state sanctions striking fire fighters had army scabs used against them as did refuse collectors in scotland political trials were started against the british withdrawal from northern ireland campaign and their supporters who tried to get british troops to desert in northern ireland they continued the policy of repression with the prevention of terrorism act and increasing the number of soldiers there meanwhile the cabinet secretly agreed to upgrade britain s nuclear submarine force with the chevaline missile system this significantly increased the number of warheads carried on polaris submarines and improved their accuracy in the end the working class had enough the winter of 1978 79 saw a massive upsurge in class struggle as workers struck for wage rises to keep up with inflation this was the so called winter of discontent the labour party became so unpopular that the election of that year saw the election of thatcher s first tory government in opposition since 1979 labour has been in opposition this has not prevented it acting in the interests of the ruling class when the falklands war started it was the pacifist leader of the labour party michael foot who gave his whole hearted support for british military action his speech in parliament did more to ensure that the task force was sent than anyone else after thatcher had finished speaking he stood up to give her his blessing he said that the falklands had been betrayed and that the responsibility for that betrayal rests with the government the government must prove by deeds that they are not responsible with those words he helped condemn nearly 2000 young men to their deaths when the miners came out on strike the labour party and tuc acted to isolate the strike they insisted that other groups not come out in sympathy they condemned mass picketing and any forms of imaginative action that broke the law this was repeated when the seafarers came out on strike against townsend thorensen that time they told workers not to strike but instead to travel with sealink every time the working class has come up against the law labour have told them to give in nowhere is this last statement more truly shown than over the poll tax millions refused to pay throughout scotland england and wales labour was the governing party in local government those labour councils have summoned millions and imprisoned hundreds for refusal or inability to pay bryan gould even proudly stated in february 1992 that labour had prosecuted more people for non payment than the tories the council with the highest imprisonment record bolton is a labour council salford even sacked an office worker for refusing to pay even now as the poll tax is coming to its end labour councils are looking for new and better ways to collect the millions owed in arrears in education labour have implemented the governments cuts one particular case is the special provision for ethnic minority children and adults here they have happily sacked teachers and closed adult classes once again they have shown how happy they are to play the racist card can labour be changed in office and out labour is a party for capitalism it is a party that has regularly and routinely acted against the working class yet we are constantly told not to give up hope every time an election comes round the different left wing groups tell us to vote labour can labour be changed we think that its history proves the impossibility of changing labour we are often told by the left that labour must be supported because it is a working class party our reply is that although it may have working class members that does not make it a working class organisation we think that the history we have outlined in this pamphlet shows quite clearly that labour has never acted for the working class labour was set up by the trade unions to act in their interests which is not the same thing as being set up by the working class the unions may once have been working class organisations now they are junior partners in the state machine whose job is to manage the buying and selling of labour power they may no longer be as influential as they were in the 1970s but their influence remains all over the country and indeed the world unions and their representatives are engaged in the day to day process of ensuring that production carries on smoothly employers value the contribution that union representatives make and go so far as to give them time off work for union activities provide them with offices seek their advice and assist their attending union training courses the influence of the unions on the labour party is not as great as it was but they continue to provide most of labour s funds the old adage holds true whoever pays the piper calls the tune the trouble with labour is that many thousands of working class people belong to it and millions still support it faced with the awful reality that is capitalism they want to do something about it clearly the solution needs to be at least partly a political one so they look for a party which seems to offer change labour are most able to offer this because they are usually a party of opposition nationally being out of office so frequently they can always claim that next time things will be different however things never can be different labour long ago gave up any pretence at wanting to get rid of capitalism equally they have got rid of any notion of nationalising large parts of it now they claim that they will make it operate more fairly this is impossible capitalism is based on the making of commodities things to buy and sell and on the exploitation of labour when we say this we mean that people who work receive less than they produce the surplus going to the bosses whether private or state capitalism needs competition to work properly and this means that the bosses must try to keep prices as low as possible this in turn means they have to get workers to make as much as possible for as little as possible that is why we are constantly being told to work harder and make more with increasing regularity capitalism is thrown into crisis by this very competitive drive millions of workers are thrown out of work and others have their wages or benefits cut this is the reality of the society we live in politicians who try to ignore this are soon brought to account by stock market crashes galloping inflation flights of currency and capital currency crises and more then they have to return to capitalist normality this has been the fate for left wing governments the world over and as we have seen has forced various labour governments to viciously attack working class living standards it is this reality which has turned every so called left leader into a traitor ramsay macdonald and clement attlee were members of the ilp harold wilson was a left winger who left attlee s government over charges for nhs glasses and dentures kinnock was a well known left winger in the 1970s and indeed rose to power on the back of his reputation left wing labour councils have been forced to introduce enormous rate bills and poll tax bills and when militant controlled liverpool they were forced to sack thousands of workers groups like the swp say that they know that labour is rotten yet come every election they demand that we all troop out and dutifully vote labour they qualify this by saying we should do it without illusions they do this for a number of reasons one is that despite all their talk many swp members and readers of socialist worker still do have illusions in labour to be open and tell workers not to be conned would risk alienating a lot of support as the swp leadership prefer masses of followers to conscious revolutionaries they have no problem making the choice of saying vote labour another reason is more sinister the swp leadership know what labour is however for all their fine talk they do not believe that the working class is capable of making a revolution itself they believe it has to be led to what they call socialism by an elite of professional revolutionaries part of this process as they see it is that the working class has to go through a whole host of experiences before it will turn to the swp for leadership one of these steps is going through the experience of a labour government they think that this will teach workers that labour is rotten they say this time and time again even though we have experienced labour in power nationally before and continue to experience it locally today this attitude reveals the contempt that the swp and the rest of the left has for working class people and their ability to change society it also means that they end up as little more than a far left electoral fig leaf for labour fostering all the illusions they claim they want to get rid of other left wing groups share this view to a greater or lesser extent some hold the view that a return of labour would mean more chance for class struggle this rests on the illusion that labour is basically on the side of the workers and anyway ignores the reality that labour is usually elected at times of rising class struggle but is elected with the purpose of containing that struggle the time has come to give up on the pretence and ditch any hopes that remain for labour to successfully change society the working class will have to do away with all capitalist parties and institutions this inevitably means that they will have to do away with the labour party and its left wing hangers on as part of the process is there an alternative all the lies cheating and manipulation of labour and its left wing hangers on would be laughable if the issues at stake weren t so vital the fact is that capitalism is a disgusting social system this century over 115 million people have been killed in capitalism s wars and countless hundreds of millions more have died from preventable disease starvation and poverty this toll of human life and misery has had the sole purpose of keeping a tiny minority of the population in wealth and privilege it is towards the maintenance of this system that all of labour s efforts have gone experience has shown that for all their fine talk of wanting to make the system fairer that the system has ended up changing them all the time labour and their friends in other countries have been trying to run capitalism there has been another struggle going on this has been the class struggle between the world s rich and the world s working class this struggle has taken many forms in britain we ve seen strikes small and large we saw the fight against the poll tax we ve seen the riots of the early eighties we see fights against the state s plans for the places we live and the schools we send our kids to we ve seen massive struggles in other countries like in poland in 1981 like in south africa even now despite the attempts of the anc to sidetrack the struggle into constitutionalism what links these struggles the world over is the way that working people are fighting to improve their living standards the way working class people are trying to get some control over their own lives away from capital what we need to do is to link up these struggles to build a community of resistance a community that will take the struggle forward to a fight against the whole of capitalism and its state it is here that revolutionary groups like subversion have a role to play we exist to spread information about struggles to show where they link up to show that they inevitably lead to a struggle not just against capitalism but for communism as we said in the pamphlet communism or socialism means the common ownership of the means of production and distribution it means getting rid of the bosses getting rid of working for a wage or salary getting rid of the whole rotten buying and selling system it means that people will freely come together to produce what is needed and will freely take from the abundant products of their labour it will involve the abolition not only of the ruling class but also their state we exist not as something separate from the working class not as some leadership for others to follow but as part of the class working for our own liberation if you agree with what we have to say and want to be part of the struggle why not join with us to hasten the day of capitalism s destruction
by w a wijewardena the roadmap is the map of the monetary board last week the new governor of the c entral bank prof w d lakshman unveiled the central bank s road map for 2020 and beyond before a select audience the speech delivered by lakshman can be accessed at though it is commonly known as the central bank s roadmap it is in effect the roadmap of the monetary board which owns the central bank hence the blame for its failure or credit for its success should not be passed on to lakshman or any senior officer of the bank but to the monetary board as a corporate body accordingly wherever the bank has been referred to in this article or elsewhere it should be construed as a reference to the monetary board the practice of announcing a roadmap was started by cabraal the practice of presenting the monetary board s action program for the upcoming year was started by former governor ajith nivard cabraal in january 2007 just six months after he assumed office cabraal s view was that by pre announcing the board s policy stance and action program the bank could manage the public s expectations effectively a necessary condition for the success of its policies this he did when the country was fighting a destructive internecine war and all macroeconomic factors were showing changes from bad to worse at that time inflation was rising at above 20 foreign reserves had fallen to a critically low level the rupee was under constant pressure for depreciation government revenue as a share of gdp was falling and expenditure due to boosted war related spending was ballooning it produced sizable deficits in the current account primary account and the overall budget due to this gloomy climate inflationary expectations were running high this last factor had adversely affected the government s borrowing plans while resources from domestic borrowing sources were scanty they were available at a high price to the government sri lanka had not yet tapped the foreign commercial markets and therefore it had to depend solely on funding by multilateral agencies and friendly countries but that was also not available in sufficient amounts as a result the central bank could not effectively implement its monetary policy hence in order to educate all its stakeholders the public politicians international agencies financial institutions the media and employees cabraal thought that the bank s futuristic vision and plans should be made public at the beginning of the year this was welcomed by financial markets having realised its advantage for managing expectations all successive governors too continued to follow this practice strong institutions convert governors from outside into strong central bankers there is a general feeling among some that an outsider emerging as the governor of the central bank is not salutary this may be true in the case of weak institutions in such cases the outsider makes the institution fit his wishes and policies but if the institution is strong it will align the outsider with its long established vision thinking and policies this is exactly what has happened in the case of central banks with strong institutional traditions in india the manmohan singh government brought in finance secretary d subbarao as the governor of the reserve bank of india in 2008 because incumbent governor y venugopal reddy was considered too independent but within months subbarao got fully converted in the central banking ideology and thinking and became more independent in his deals with the government than even reddy in 2004 sunil mendis walked away from hayleys and into the governor s office promising that the central bank would take action to improve agricultural productivity under his management but he soon became a fully fledged monetary hawk someone who strongly believed in the efficacy of conservative monetary policies cabraal walked into the bank in 2006 with a mandate from the political authority in one hand and mahinda chinthana the policy document of then incumbent president mahinda rajapaksa in the other cabraal was a quick learner and within months he adopted a strong central banking philosophy the current governor lakshman a known social democrat announced at his first press conference after assuming office that he did not believe in washington consensus type neoliberal economic policies the speech delivered on the occasion of the release of the road map 2020 is demonstrative of his swift move away from this stance he has reiterated that he will do his best to sustain and add to the institutional greatness of the central bank and uphold the great traditions it has built over the past seven decades this is a salutary development covering the full range of work of the central bank the road map for 2020 and beyond presents an account of the state of the economy today before venturing into the three areas of policy it has covered monetary policy financial stability policy and policies relating to its agency functions the sad state of sri lanka s economy the present state of the economy is exactly what independent economists had diagnosed earlier and what the central bank had not openly accepted according to the roadmap sri lanka s economy which is at a crossroads today is suffering from a number of ailments economic growth is below potential growth there are many poverty pockets in the country despite the overall reduction of the poverty headcount productive resources are being underutilised and one glaring example is agriculture there has been inadequate expansion and diversification of exports despite the policies adopted in the past the country has generated foreign funding but most of such funding has added to its debt stock thus the non debt foreign funding flow in the form of investments in the capital market and business enterprises has also been short compared to requirements there have been wide fluctuations in interest rates and credit flows budget deficits have been beyond the country s tolerable level and public debt has been inordinately high the path to becoming a rich country these are in fact serious macroeconomic ailments from which the country had been suffering for a long period of time independent policy analysts and think tanks have been repeatedly drawing the attention of successive governments to the need for resolving them to place the country on a needed high growth path without resolving them there is no way for sri lanka to become a rich country in retrospect the required growth to elevate sri lanka to the status of a rich economy within about 40 years has been around 8 per annum after allowing for an annual population growth of about 1 still the annual average growth rate during the post independence period has been well below this level at a meagre 4 5 hence sri lanka has become a laggard among its peer countries prospectively if sri lanka maintains average economic growth of 6 5 in the future after allowing for population growth of 1 it could become a rich country within about 20 years it is necessary to adopt an effective economic policy program for sri lanka to attain this goal the roadmap has qualified these policies to be innovative emanating from and backed by innovative thinking since the economic policy framework to accelerate the economy comes within the purview of the government the suggestion here is that the government should be an innovative institution such policy should be framed by those who have an innovative mindset immediate challenge of the government as i have argued in the previous article in this series sri lanka s immediate challenge has been to reverse the declining trend in economic growth generate sufficient foreign exchange resources to meet the country s foreign debt repayment obligations and provide relief to businesses mainly in the small and medium enterprise sme sector which has been suffering from exposure to a downswing in the business cycle as i have presented in the article under the title fixing lending rates and waiving farmer loans two policies that do not augur well for borrowers available at many entrepreneurs in the small business sector have begun to experience shortages in cash due to subdued market demand these entrepreneurs have been turned away by formal banking institutions and as a result have become unwilling customers of informal money lenders as i have documented in the article mentioned above a loan could be raised from these money lenders in less than an hour once the loan is approved the loan proceeds are delivered most conveniently to the doorstep of the borrower instantly the loan recovery and interest collection are also done by calling on the place of business of the borrower the only complaint by borrowers is the exorbitant interest rates charged at 10 per month and the short maturity of loans within 100 days since these small entrepreneurs cannot earn profits at more than 10 per month there is not enough cash to service the loans hence like the sri lankan government old loans are repaid by raising new loans hence it is inevitable that they get into an inescapable debt trap therefore the relief package extended to the sme sector is a welcome development the central bank can only facilitate growth the central bank can only play a facilitating role in accelerating economic growth the main responsibility in doing so rests with the government that is because unlike the government which can undertake real enterprises by taxing people or by borrowing funds the bank is not supposed to do so by using the only weapon it has namely the ability to print money and acquire real resources from the economy the central bank is expected to implement its monetary policy which is changing interest rates and credit levels impartially without favouring any particular business enterprise if it owns real enterprises it may be compelled to offer favours to the enterprises that it owns hence in the monetary law act the monetary board has been precluded from owning businesses in this context the bank s facilitating role comes from maintaining economic and price stability a more cogent way of describing macroeconomic stability within the system when the prices are stable businesses will be able to take a longer term view of the economy and make investments for the future the need for a proper incentive package one thing to remember is that macroeconomic stability in the country is a necessary condition but not sufficient to ensure high economic growth growth comes from the hard work of people at all levels and hard work is induced by the incentive package available in the system the main ingredients in the incentive package are appropriate remuneration for work protection of property rights observance of the rule of law and incentives for improving business practices by using new technologies ironically they all come in what is now labelled neoliberal policies these are all responsibilities of the government and not of the central bank the bank can only advise the government and it is in the interest of the government to listen to such advice in this connection both the central bank and the government have to collaborate continued engagement with imf a must road map for 2020 and beyond has accepted contrary to what many in the government believe that sri lanka should continue to engage with the international monetary fund imf the country has undergone the sixth review of the present extended fund facility eff by the imf and received the seventh installment of the loan it had gotten from the fund it is only the eighth installment which is to be disbursed in the current year the successful completion of imf program is vital for sri lanka because it has to borrow from international commercial markets to gain capacity to honour the debt repayment obligations falling on the country in 2020 and beyond once the present eff is completed it is necessary to go for a new facility immediately to allow sri lanka to maintain its creditworthiness in the eyes of foreign lenders this is of course a short term measure and in the long run necessary policy reforms should be introduced by the government to increase the net volume of foreign exchange earnings by the country mla should be amended the roadmap has pronounced that the bank will continue to follow the easing of monetary policy in the years to come within the permissible limit of maintaining the inflation rate between 4 and 6 this is in fact the acceptance of the inflation targeting monetary policy framework presently being followed by the bank by the new regime it is a laudable development however two requirements are needed for the bank to follow this policy one is that when inflation moves above the upper limit of 6 the bank will have to commence tightening monetary policy the other is that the bank should be given full freedom to continue with this policy by appropriately amending the monetary law act in this context a new monetary law act had already been gazetted as a bill by the previous government while the roadmap is silent on this already gazetted draft bill it has made a passing reference that the bank will make adjustments to the monetary law act to align it with global best practices it is understandable that the new government should take time to study the proposed act but an amendment to the law to improve the bank s governance enhance its independence transparency and accountability and establish proper fiscal monetary coordination is a must today the new government cannot ignore this requirement hence the government s cooperation is needed to attain the goals of the bank s road map for 2020 and beyond the writer a former deputy governor of the central bank of sri lanka can be reached at waw1949 gmail com

in the blind pursuit of hot money pakistan s economic managers are foolhardily focused on generate dollar inflows by from abroad by selling short term treasury bills t bills and pakistan investment bonds pibs at higher rates exactly the incumbent regime is following egyptian model for building up foreign currency reserves despite knowing that cairo was facing catch 22 situation at the moment for doing the same under the guidelines of the international monetary fund imf programme when egypt had entered the programme by end of 2016 its foreign currency reserves were in the range of 15 billion and under a three year program of 12 billion they rose to 45 billion the foreign currency reserves of northeastern african nation increased 30 billion out of which 20 billion were raised through hot money now egypt is on the horns of a dilemma because its policy makers are facing a difficult situation to keep this hot money worth 20 billion in the system recently egypt s central bank decreased policy rate by 100 basis points that resulted in the exclusion of 1 billion if their policy rate further reduces then it is feared the accumulated hot money will find any other destination where the lenders could maximise their profits through short term investments egypt was pursuing this flawed policy when dr reza baqir was working there as imf s resident chief before deciding to quit that position to join as governor state bank of pakistan sbp pakistan is now following the same policy and in the first few months the country has attracted over 1 5 billion as investment in short term its debt market pakistan s debt market has so far fetched around 1 5 billion and 10 million from abroad through the short term t bills and pibs respectively at markup rates that are on the higher side this foreign funding landed in short term t bills at a time when the policy rates are persisting at 13 25 percent for a while it is feared that when policy rates will be slashed down this money will fly out of pakistan in search of more favourable destination in any other part of the world so we will be witnessing quite a peculiar situation when this hot money dries out in case policy rates go down this will incentivise the central bank to keep the policy rates on higher side it can lead to the creation of a conflict of interest for the policymakers who might prefer to keep the monetary stance tighter in order to keep foreign investments within the system the independent economists hue and cry that this blind pursuit for luring hot money at higher rates will harm domestic investment and economic activities is only falling on the deaf ears of the policy smiths pakistan s former economic advisor and renowned economist dr ashfaque hassan khan said there is no rationale behind attracting this kind of hot money there can be a substitute to this highly unpredictable short term money the government can launch international bonds such as eurobond and sukuk bond for a period of five to ten years with single digit markup rate when apprised that federal cabinet deferred ministry of finance tabled summaries for launching international bonds mainly because certain ministers opposed the proposal following mortgaging motorways highways and airport terminals khan said it could only be termed as economic illiteracy and nothing else the economist also said the sukuk was an asset backed bond and many islamic countries used this instrument to generate dollar inflows there is another element that should also be kept in mind the government had projected generating 3 billion through international bonds so if this plan was dropped then the government would have to rely on domestic borrowing for raising around rs500 billion for financing its budget deficit that would have grown even larger keeping existing higher interest rates in view out of 1 5 billion inflows into short term debt market the bulk of foreign money into t bills has come from the uk and the usa amounting 746 million and 663 million respectively dr hafeez a pasha another top economist of the country said there was no justification for drawing in hot money at the expense of discouraging private sector investment the higher policy rate was also playing havoc with budgetary estimates and increasing debt servicing requirements pasha added inflationary expectations have been cited as a major cause for keeping the policy rate high however the inflation rate clocked in at 12 63 percent but the core inflation has started receding coming down from 8 percent to 7 5 percent for december 2019 when core inflation non food and non energy stands at 7 5 percent there is no justification for freezing the overall policy rate at 13 25 percent other than a means for attracting hot money from abroad the sbp officials do not agree to certain assumptions and argued that the foreign portfolio was a friction to overall investment so the central bank could not be held responsible for protecting friction part of over 1 billion as the sole reason for maintaining a hawkish monetary regime now the question arises that are there any guarantees this friction will remain lower over the next two and half year period it is feared that it might cross 10 billion to 15 billion to meet net international reserves nir target under the imf programme on other hand the federal board of revenue fbr also promulgated tax laws second amendment ordinance 2019 the fbr states that the existing foreign exchange framework of the country allows non residents to invest in debt securities and government securities through special convertible rupee accounts scras maintained with banks in pakistan there is no restriction on repatriation of funds from scras which incentivises investment in the debt market by non resident investors several amendments for encouraging investment in the domestic debt market and simplifying the tax regime for non resident companies have been introduced this hot money poses risks for pakistan s economy and even humayun akhtar khan chairman institute of policy reforms who is also a member of the ruling party has recently cautioned the policymakers against attracting hot money thus this policy needs to be reversed the writer is a staff member

commentary the 19 month u s china trade dispute has led to a realignment of global supply chain and exacerbated china s economic woes but as a side effect senior chinese officials have taken a break from fighting corruption and chinese communist party ccp leader xi jinping has finally changed his idealistic zero tolerance for corruption to a more moderate tolerance for errors this tolerance for errors policy is not only aimed at private entrepreneurs whose past transgressions have not yet been investigated but also a tolerance for officials who are less corrupt xi has changed from imposing heavy handed penalties to imposing heavy handed demands by using the discipline inspection and supervision system to force local officials to search for economic growth strategies a task force to grow the economy let s start with the news an article in the pro beijing media outlet duowei news published on dec 9 2019 wrote on dec 6 the ccp general secretary xi jinping chaired a meeting of the politburo of the central committee will adopt a carrot and stick policy to supervise the implementation of reforms through mechanisms of tolerance for errors incentive and punishment this tolerance for errors policy in essence is xi allowing regional officials to redeem themselves duowei news stated according to xi s speech at the politburo meeting the main problems of china s economy neither come from the external pressure of the u s china trade war nor from basic economic problems such as decreasing returns and population aging as suggested by some so called economists the ccp knows very well that the problem behind the so called economy is still its personnel in china specifically it is the issue of local officials traditional economists theorized a lot last year about the difficulty of restructuring china s economy and earlier this year about the scourge of african swine fever they thought these are the root cause of china s economic difficulties even state media outlet xinhua highlighted zero tolerance for corruption of inaction some time ago now the emperor found the root cause himself the so called economic problem is the problem of local officials putting their thoughts and interests above the country s in xi s carrot and stick strategy the so called carrot is the promotion of certain officials the stick which are the anti corruption agencies is naturally prior evidence of corruption violations of the law and other transgressions the ccp central committee is currently tolerating these officials if they behave well and carry out xi s orders they will be promoted to a higher rank and excused zhou bo an executive vice mayor of shanghai who received a stern warning from the ccp for violating the party s rules has been appointed deputy party secretary of liaoning province instead due to his ability to turn around the economy this is superficially similar to former ccp leader deng xiaoping s thinking when he famously said it doesn t matter whether the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice during deng s time corruption was more behind the scenes during former ccp leader jiang zemin s regime things had changed jiang permitted cats to catch mice as well as steal food finally evolving into the situation that many big and small cats hide billions of dollars in cash and cats with social connections even opened accounts in offshore financial centers after xi came to power his anti corruption campaign has made it impossible for cats to cheat publicly most of the surface grafts were banned and the cats have lost their enthusiasm to catch mice or carry out their official duties the ccp central committee has bemoaned for years about the inactions of some local officials today xi has finally figured out that the stick must be accompanied by a few carrots or incentives and the main incentive is to waive past corruption local officials chinese government officials at all levels know very well how to develop the economy within china s institutional environment and are good at learning guangdong province and coastal areas developed through introducing foreign investment and the entire country immediately began to attract outside investments yet foreign investors do not have the same affinity for china s central and western regions so poorer provinces can only gaze at for example guangdong s foreign capital and sigh some provinces prefectures and cities used real estate development to drive the economy and soon the whole country became popular with real asset finance housing prices soon became some of the most expensive in the world shanghai and beijing even entered the list of world s top ten expensive cities when it comes to building subways more than 30 chinese cities have spent more than 600 billion yuan 88 billion to build urban rail transit including subways but only a few have broken even on their rail projects there are several so called grey rhinos known asset bubbles in the chinese economy one of which is acknowledged to be the huge debt incurred by the government s investment in infrastructure construction as for finance thanks to the central government s failure to delegate power to local governments otherwise p2p peer to peer lending and other personal finance products won t be the only ones to collapse across the country as a result officials have been less active in recent years developing less real estate and investing less in so called infrastructure to reduce bad debts in the financial system this structural problem of china s economy could have been adjusted a decade ago but the global financial crisis of 2008 was a turning point i wrote at the time that if they missed the final window of adjustment in 2008 there would be no hope to change it in the future during the u s china trade war the united states wants china to make structural changes and stop subsidizing exports by state owned enterprises china can t say yes to this requirement because to do that would be suicidal under xi officials are allowed to redeem themselves by good service if the economy catches up their previous crimes will be atoned if the economy fails to catch up anti corruption agencies may come knocking at the door original sin of private companies remember that the state council issued a guidance on sept 12 2019 which stipulated that whistleblowers should be set up in companies and other institutions to encourage insiders to expose violations by their institutions the government is doing this because china s private companies are guilty of the original sin of wandering through gray areas to accumulate wealth this fact is due to china s extremely adverse institutional environment when government officials treat all public functions as tools to grow the chinese regime s revenue if private enterprises want to survive and grow they have to form political and business alliances with bigwigs and obtain industry licenses land and bank loans through bribery tax evasion is a commonplace phenomenon the chinese regime thus has an interest in feeding such corruption and leveraging such sinners to grow its economy by using the whistleblower system and threatening to expose private companies sins authorities force them to toe the party line chinese authorities are well aware that private enterprises will not survive long if they subsume such companies under its direct control as state owned firms so by allowing private entrepreneurs to keep operating and hiring staff the companies can pay more taxes create jobs for the economy and

because consumer spending has dropped significantly in budget 2019 the finance minister had pegged india s nominal gross domestic product gdp growth rate at 12 percent for 2019 20 now the nominal gdp growth is expected at about 7 5 percent in the last budget the fm had revised the fiscal deficit target to 3 3 percent of gdp but now it s probable that the government will miss this target story

dollar economy is not a sudden development and it is based on a deep understanding of the strengths of the country according to him sectors like tourism urban development infrastructure and the agri based industry have a high potential to take forward the economy and result in massive employment generation it s not possible to grow over extended periods without major structural reforms the upcoming budget is the event where we can expect reforms to manifest which will set a path for the economy to achieve this target of a 5 trillion economy over the next five years attract more fdi

growth is crucial for india s goal of becoming a 5 trillion economy by 2025 india s share of global exports is less than 2 percent rbi s focus should be on reducing the cost of capital by further lowering the repo rates and ensuring that benefits should be passed on to the consumers the cost of logistics should be brought down in the upcoming budget and the economy should be opened to global investors in a range of areas such as real estate defense insurance pension funds etc the focus of the government should be on signing multiple free trade agreements fta s which would improve the value chain and will give india an edge over non member countries india needs to create a freer autonomous economic zone where concentrated manufacturing activity could be developed without the fear of labour laws land laws or any other obstructions increase ease of doing business in this budget we expect the government to focus on more reforms towards achieving a better rank for the ease of doing business sustained business reforms over the past several years have helped india jump 14 places to move to 63rd position in the global ease of doing business rankings in the world bank s ease of doing business 2020 report still our challenge is that in the next two years we must reach the top 50 and in the next five years reach the top 25 india still lags in areas such as enforcing

high income economies agricultural reforms and urbanization structural agricultural reforms in india is the need of the hour as 58 of india depends on this sector the government is spending a lot on agriculture subsidies but not much has been achieved india needs robust physical markets technology upgradation and contract farming among others most farmers do not have the capacity or means to benefit from the existing schemes therefore it is better to adopt an out of the box approach we need to develop a new model where farmers learn to be productive by working in association with a professional firm that takes care of farming marketing and exports allowing contract farming will resolve many of these issues urbanization at a faster speed will also help india increase the optimal use of its resources under the census definition 31 percent of the indian population lived in urban areas in 2011 major world cities account for 82 percent of the global gdp despite being less in number america and europe have already completed urbanization while china is nearing the completion india has just begun urbanization and there is much scope to develop megacities this will solve unemployment issues and will also allow the optimal use of natural resources singapore is the best example of urbanization which uses water resources more optimally the author is chairman and managing

craig hemke gold silver 2020 prediction slams biased gold naysayers mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in craig hemke of the tf metals report craig is a well known name in the metals industry and runs one of the most highly respected websites in our space and provides some of the best analysis you will find anywhere on banking schemes global macroeconomics and evidence of manipulation in the gold and silver markets happy new year to you craig thanks for coming on and welcome how are you craig hemke mike it s always a pleasure new year s started off with a bang man i hope it s not indicative of how crazy this entire year is going to be we ll see yeah certainly this week sparking action itself lots going on both geopolitically and in the markets and we ll get to a lot of that well craig here we are entering another new year the conflict with iran and the potential for an escalation there spurred some safe haven buying in recent days but the rally in metals started last month i d like to open by getting your thoughts on what you believe will be driving metals prices this year yes we expect the forces of evil to continue doing their best to manage prices and we ll get to that topic of price manipulation in a moment but talk about what you re seeing in the metals here recently and discuss some of the themes you anticipate people will be talking about this year when it comes to the metals well i think it s critical that people try to have a longer memory than 48 hours as we record this today i m seeing all kinds of garbage i saw garbage from some group that is always a perma bear always talking about howhas topped out and going down has a clear agenda just like some of the short sellers that are always anonymously pound the mining stocks with fake research reports and stuff like that and i m seeing these things today about how oh yeah gold look at that look how terrible that candle looks on the daily chart and how come hold s not going up when all this war stuff and it s like do you not understand i mean gold went up prior to the war starting beginning last thursday gold closed on the comex last thursday january the 1st at about 15 30 so the whole move from 1 530 to 1 580 was war premium if you will really short term war premium then the spike to 1 610 was when we seemed to be on the verge of what could even have been a nuclear war in the middle east the fact that it s pulled back to 1 550 shouldn t surprise anybody i mean we hadn t even worked out all the war premium yet despite what is some pretty cheery economic news this week service sector pmis the adp jobs report that kind of thing so jeez louise i sure hope people keep their perspective you are correct in pointing out mike that the metals rallied strongly into the year and it had nothing to do with war that wasn t on anybody s mind prior to about six o clock in the evening on january the 2nd gold rallied 3 from december the 20th through that date silver rallied 8 5 from december 9th at 16 60 up to 18 40 on january the 2nd the hui the gold bugs index which everybody s freaking out because the shares went down yesterday the hui is up 15 still since the middle of october for a while it was up 20 and why is this happening because the fed whether they want to call it qe or not began this direct monetization of the debt program in october everything s going up stock market you name it and that is going to continue this year it s only going to get worse a lot of people missed last friday the 3rd the minutes for the december fed meeting were released first of all everybody was on vacation still on friday january the 3rd and second of all those are always released on a wednesday three weeks after the fed meeting so no one s looking for them on a friday afternoon at two o clock but here they came and buried within the minutes anybody can pull these up is admission that what s very likely to happen in the months ahead is the fed will start monetizing not just t bills but notes longer term duration notes two years three years five years seven years ten years there s no other option they cannot afford the stock market to go down they cannot afford the money supply to contract and thus they will constantly be printing all through this year more and more dollars and everything is going to go up for the reasons that were driving them last year please don t get caught up in what happened and how the chart looks based on these extraordinarily rare events that we saw back on tuesday there s been a bit of a pattern in recent years where the metals start perking up in december and perform well in the first half of the year any thoughts about what s behind that and are you looking for that pattern to repeat this year craig yeah we were talking about it on my site all the way through december it was logical to expect first in november you expected the metals to trade lower because the december contract is always the most heavily traded all year long and the december contracts both gold and silver had massive open interest and they were both going off the board at the end of november which meant all the speculators that were long were going to have to sell and if they don t completely roll over their positions into february then that effect is a selling pressure the price went down i told people all through november i thought 1 440 that d about do it we re already so extremely oversold i couldn t see a waterfall down i think we saw 1 445 i thought we d rally into the end of the year because as you said mike that s typically been the pattern especially since the bear market lows were put in back in 2015 the shares performed well especially in the back half of december because they re subject to so much tax loss selling particularly in canada and that usually concludes around 18th 20th people want to get that done before they go on christmas holiday and so once again we got that behind us and up with the metals let me just point this out to you mike because this is a lot like last year you remember last year the stock market crashed remember that in december of 2018 sure worst december in decades yeah it was crashing and basically the stock market was catching down to the contraction of the money supply that the fed was doing by trying to normalize whatever that means their balance sheet and the stock market finally caught on to that disappearance of liquidity and so what happened on christmas eve treasury secretary steven mnuchin and anybody can look it up i m not making this stuff up mnuchin called a meeting of what s called the plunge protection team the president s working group on financial markets they came up with a strategy to float it back higher the day after christmas after the holiday the dow went up a thousand points and never looked back now this was when gold first started to move higher was in december last year because interest rates had peaked in november and this is what all caused me to issue a forecasting saying 19 was going to be the best year for the metal since 2010 well why because the fed was going to be reversing course and they were going to be printing cash because they don t have any choice but to liquefy and continue to liquefy all these markets they can t have deflation they can t have crashing stock markets they can t have higher interest rates none of that stuff so in december of 2018 gold starts to rally and everywhere everybody s like well this is just a safe haven deal gold s going to 1 100 in 2019 and all this crap harry dent stuff anyway that s not what happened it wasn t what was going to happen it s not what did happen and so now here we are gold rallying again anticipating what s going to be happening this year and it s the same thing well the only reason gold went up is because of the safe haven stuff as if gold rallying in december and the shares railings since october had something to do with the idea that the u s was going to whack this soleimani character on january the 2nd it didn t have anything you do with that gold is simply looking ahead looking over the horizon as it always does sees all this liquidity coming from the central banks around the world because it can t afford to do anything else and it s moving higher and people need to understand that and they need to plan for that as they make their investment allocations for 2020 now let s talk about price manipulation nobody does a better job than you when it comes to covering what the crooked bankers are up to in the paper markets for gold and silver they sold a boatload of futures contracts last year in both metals you observed that open interest in gold was up a whopping 70 said another way the supply of paper gold rose by 70 yet the amount of gold in the vaults backing that paper barely budged it s quite the racket so while gold itself is actually scarce and hard to produce futures contracts are exactly the opposite the supply is essentially unlimited last year 33 million new ounces of paper gold were dumped into the market despite that gold prices still managed to rise by 18 or so so what do you make of that yeah i mean how the world and i guess i don t know too many people get their beaks dipped in this or just simply don t care but how the world allows how the mining companies allow their product to be priced not off of the exchange of the actual commodity but off the exchange of these derivative contracts that have nothing to do with anything it s like i look at you and i say mike here we ll call this contract between you and i gold and i promise at some point that i got the gold behind it and if you want it i ll deliver it to you and then you promise that you re actually interested in it and you go borrow a bunch of money from your broker dealer to buy it on margin and then we just pretend that that contract is actually there s going to be some physical exchange between us at some point but that never happens and at the end of the day you just say well i liked my exposure and i sell my contract you sell your contract and i taking the other side of it buy it back and there was never any gold exchange at all there was just some weird promise that there was a backing to it and it s a trading of those things that is allowed to determine prices it s just ridiculous yeah let s backtrack to that open interest thing that you said because here s a great way to look at it everybody knows or at least should know that 2018 was the largest year of global central bank gold purchases since 1969 the year after the london gold pool 651 metric tons projections are run rates i haven t seen the actual final numbers yet but the projections are the 2019 was even greater probably about 670 metric tons so there is what 25 of global mine output actually demanded i guess as far as we can tell physically delivered to the central bank 670 metric tons of physical demand offset by as you said the creation of over 1 000 metric tons of digital pretend paper gold contracts it s like a two headed monster i mean you ve got the actual physical product which as you said is scarce being priced by the trading of derivatives which can be created infinitely because no one ever calls any of these people to the carpet so it s ridiculous it s outlandish yes gold managed to rise 18 last year even while the supply of derivative contracts increased by 73 imagine if there was some forced linkage between the ability to create contracts and the amount of actual gold on deposit in the vaults and you couldn t have increased it by 73 what if the supply only increased by 10 well then all that money around the planet looking for gold exposure would have had to find it through acquisition of existing contracts this is how the stock market that allegedly works but that s not how it works in the pricing of precious metals the banks just create more contracts taking the opposite side taking the short side and figuring they can out last the speculators eventually maybe forced them out and cover their shorts it s disgusting and again at the end of the day what s really astonishing are these dopey rock breaking geologist ceos of the mining companies that think it s a valid pricing structure and they fall for it that s what s really mind blowing i want to ask you about the possibility of whether or not the bullion banks will lose control of prices anytime soon that 70 jump in open interest is extraordinary the department of justice is prosecuting several people and they have secured some guilty pleas it s interesting that they are using rico laws perhaps they actually see the bank activity for what it truly is organized crime officials in london are asking some pointed questions about the fraudulent use of efps exchange for physical an optimist would say that some of these developments will lead to reforms but i think we ve all learned that you should never overestimate bureaucrats ability or willingness to do the right thing we may have to wait for the market to solve the problem which will happen right after confidence in the futures markets the banks and or the dollar collapses what are your thoughts about how much longer this crooked price discovery system will persist craig well mike you ve said a mouthful there let me pick off a couple of things you mentioned the regulatory agencies you got the rico investigations here in the u s it s pervasive the fraud is pervasive the former head of jp morgan s precious metals desk who is also on the board of the london bullion marketing association the lbma why would he be on both why would he be a jpm trader and on the board at the lbma but anyway he s now been indicted the rico statutes allow you to not just go after the goon but allow you to go after the don so we ll see how far it reaches however it does reach across the pond my friend andy mcguire has been telling me this now for over a year that the fca which is the english british equivalent of the sec i guess or department of justice whatever has been looking into the risks that are being taken by the english banks and what that might pose the system andy has told me about a meeting he had with a couple of members of parliament and this guy andrew bailey who at the time was the head of the fca this was back in maybe august and this bailey had no idea because the lbma s so opaque i mean you don t get these stats every day all the unallocated gold and all this stuff and the risk that the bullion banks are taking there so andy laid it out for him and he said this guy s jaw dropped and he s like look we can t afford a second financial crisis off of this i mean the people we already shafted them once they ll never let us get away with it again we have to put a stop to this somehow and andy told him about the efps and we ll get to how that continues in a second so anyway this guy bailey who according to andy said we got to somehow put a stop to this this guy bailey was just nominated and confirmed to be the head of the bank of england by boris johnson so what s he going to do does the buck stop when he leaves there leaves the fca and now he s got to be a servant to the bank of england and stop paying attention or maybe he s going to call the banks on the carpet i know what direction i think any cynical or non cynical person would think that that s going to go but i digress these efps that i ve been writing about for a couple of years this is an arcane process that s a part of every futures market but i just can t even describe the degrees to which it is abused i guess that s the right word within golden silver i ve kept track of i don t even know what it is over the last two years something like 14 000 metric tons of gold contracts each comex gold contract is a hundred ounces allegedly of gold well enough contracts that are the equivalent of 14 000 metric tons had been moved off the comex and exchanged for physical efp through london andy says they have this process where they swing them into these 13 day little contracts that are off the books and just keep rolling them over and over and over trying to kind of hide it and pretend that it s not there but this process continues mike let me lay this on you it s just that we ve had as we speak five trading days in the year 2020 in those five trading days there have already been 67 713 comex contracts shifted off of the exchange and exchanged for physical as they say again in london 67 000 mike again every contract is a hundred ounces that s 6 7 million ounces that s 210 metric tons of gold the whole comex vaults only holds 8 million ounces and they shifted 210 metric tons 6 7 billion ounces off exchange in just five days this is the scam of the greatest order and like i said again the amazing thing is that it still exists that people in 2020 when the world is all interconnected and everybody knows everything and i can watch missiles take off in iran five minutes after they re shot just by following twitter it s amazing that this continues it s just mind boggling that this is allowed to continue yeah well put you beat your head against the wall trying to figure out when it s going to finally end and why there s not more talk about it well craig before we wrap up i d like to get any final thoughts i know you ve got a lot to say here early in the year if you could give metals investors an idea of what it is that you re going to be watching most closely what they should be watching most closely over these first few months of the year and then maybe a sign that perhaps the powers that be are losing control or any other comments you want to make here as we wrap up yeah i don t know mike since i ve been doing this and i have to admit kind of fallen forward a little bit and getting excited about it myself back in 2009 and 10 that kind of thing this hyperbole of the comex is going to fail come on that ll all happen in a blink of an eye someday or overnight but to sit there and these people that say it s going to fail above 22 silver i mean come on we ll see the banks are going to keep it going as long as they possibly can and i don t think anybody can come up with a time table for it the only thing it that will end is a run on the banks for physical metal and this kind of thing gains momentum and it snowballs and finally that realization of what a scam at all is sinks in and people panic to get their hands on actual mental while they can again i can t stress this enough ignore the perma bears with an agenda they re trying to talk down the market they re trying to talk down the shares or trying to talk down the individual shares because they have some massive short position the fed is going to continue with the repo crisis it s not going away the u s is going to have at least a 1 2 trillion deficit every year this decade that s what the congressional budget office says that money s got to come from somewhere the central banks cannot afford a deflationary collapse they will be printing and printing and printing even absent that argument about what that does to the dollar and all this other stuff that cash goes someplace and it goes everywhere again it s not a mistake that the hui was up 20 since october 15th is now up 15 what happened on october 15th that s when this whole new not qe debt monetization program kicked in everything s going up okay so everything s going to continue to go up the banks are going to throw up roadblocks we ve already got 800 000 contracts of open interest comex gold so i don t know how far gold will go 1 650 maybe if it kind of gets rolling it can go to 1 750 this year that d be a pretty good year from where we are where i think the real interest should be for people that want to either have some fun make some trading fiat currency that then they can buy more physical metal that kind of thing i mean start looking into whether or not you have exposure to the mining shares not just the big companies but the medium juniors and the explorers that kind of stuff because as global asset managers who have all this cash and they re always looking for a place to go once the gdx the ddxj the hui begin to make new highs versus 2016 the floodgates are going to open and money s going to come pouring into the sector and it all has to pass through a little tiny funnel because there s only so many places it can go it s just simple economics you get twice the cash chasing the same handful of stocks and they re going to go up in price so i think it s going to be a very good year again for the metal just like last year was and i was right when i predicted it last year but i think the real outsize gains will probably be in the shares more than in the physical metal i wrote that up i kind of make an annual forecast every january i posted it to my site it s a free link maybe i ll send it to you mike you can put it on this page i always try to come up with a catchy name so this year s title is 2020 foresight instead of 2020 hindsight kind of clever huh anyway 2020 foresight is what it s called you can go to my site or like i said if you can put it on this page and it will just explain to you the basis for why i think it s going to be a good year if you ve got time i think it s worth a read yeah it would be time well spent for sure i always say we spend a lot of time looking at your site here in this office it s money well spent for anybody that wants to get on board there with tf metals report and before we let you go here craig tell people a little bit more about your site how they can get signed up and maybe some other tidbits they should know well really the best thing about my site i mean i do analysis every day and we try to keep people locked into the big picture not the tick by tick stuff but the site is i mean the people that populate it are from all around the world all different political views but we realize we re all in the same boat and so instead of bickering at each other and name calling and all that kind of stuff rule number seven in the community guidelines is treat others the way you want to be treated come on your mother taught you that why do you think just because it s an anonymous website you can be rude and mean like twitter things like that so anyway the community itself is what s worth it it s only 12 bucks a month so it s not like i m getting rich off of it 40 cents a day to give you access really keep you on top and grounded of where we re headed and again i just can t emphasize enough i mean mike the old line is a rising tide lifts all boats right think of the rising tide being all of the cash it has to be created from nothing you must understand this is direct monetization of the debt by the fed primary dealers they get the treasury bills soon to be treasury notes from the treasury the primary dealers are the ones responsible for making that market and getting them filled they buy them themselves and anybody can zerohedge has been great about writing this the fed then buys these directly from the primary dealers about 72 hours later okay so there s an intermediary in between but basically the fed is buying the treasury bills soon to be notes directly from the treasury how that isn t direct monetization of that i don t know just because there s a step in between so this is happening modern monetary theory all that stuff that the politicians daydream about that s coming and whether you are going to want to talk about gold standard and system reset and all that kind of stuff whatever yeah sure but all of that cash is going to be sloshing around stock market s going to go up everything so gold and silver are going to go up and the shares are going to be particularly advantageous to own in the next few months and so again i just want to keep everybody grounded and not be thinking about the events of tuesday and i mean that was a real you want to talk about one off that was a one off that was hopefully something that you ll never see again in your lifetime this on the

equity performance iron ore prices and china risk premia are all close to neutral so far this month advertisement what are we missing one possible explanation is a phenomenon we have pointed out in each of the last five years a consistent tendency for certain currencies aud nzd and cad in particular to overshoot in january and to go on to reverse january s move whichever direction it is in in the remainder of q1 we tested this by looking at a simple trading strategy that positions systematically for a reversal of january s move in february and march and found consistently positive returns in these three currencies we don t suggest trading on the basis of such a simple rule despite the 64 returned in nzd in particular over the last 20 years but the consistency of returns does inform how we interpret january price action with a good deal of caution there is some evidence that these relatively illiquid pro cyclical currencies are prone to overcrowding as investors use them to express

first a review of last week s events eur usd as you know life is like a zebra a black stripe comes after a white one and vice versa that was what happened this time as well after the merry new year holidays came the anxious expectation of a full fledged war between the united states and iran but a few days later it became clear that both sides want to avoid a full fledged conflict and the tension in the geopolitical field went gradually down which is clearly visible in the oil prices last week everything went well for the us dollar at first the us currency was growing thanks to new record highs in the us stock market and optimistic statements of the fed s leaders so the president of the federal reserve of richmond thomas barkin said that the country s economy and the labor market in the united states looked strong and according to fed vice president richard clarida the current monetary policy of his organization is fully consistent with the state of the country s economy according to forecasts us gdp growth in 2020 may be 2 2 5 or even more up until friday january 10 the dollar was growing in anticipation of strong data from the us labor market as a result as expected by 45 of experts supported by 85 of indicators and graphical analysis on h4 the eur usd pair fell to the support of 1 1100 and then by another 15 points but the data on the number of new jobs outside the agricultural sector nfp disappointed the market so strongly a drop of 43 that the pair turned sharply north jumping to the height of 1 1130 it met the end of the trading session at the level of 1 1120 gbp usd for the third week in a row the result for the british pound is close to zero starting from the horizon of 1 3075 by tuesday january 07 it reached the height of 1 3210 then fell to the support of 1 3010 turned around again and finished the five day period at 1 3060 losing only 15 points during this time however as before due to its rather high volatility the pair did not deprive traders of the opportunity to earn the weekly scope of its fluctuations amounted to 200 points usd jpy the forecast for this pair was 100 accurate recall that in the opinion of the majority of analysts 70 supported by graphical analysis on d1 the pair s drop had to stop at the level of 107 80 having rebounced from which it was supposed to go to the 109 25 resistance and then to the last december highs in the area of 109 70 in reality on monday january 06 the pair found the bottom at 107 76 turned around and went up on wednesday the yen made another attempt to gain a foothold below the level of 107 00 however it was unsuccessful as well and by the end of the week the pair as expected by experts reached the set height of 109 70 this was followed by a small correction and the final chord sounded at the level of 109 50 cryptocurrencies indeed it seems that a number of investors are considering bitcoin as a financial haven so against the background of the confrontation between the us and iran the reference cryptocurrency reached a month and a half high breaking some important resistance levels fake information about a sharp increase in the capitalization of stablecoin tether usdt on coinmarketcap by 500 million also contributed to the growth as a result the cost of btc soared to the height of 8 450 per coin the analysis of what happened last week suggests that the crypto market quotes begin to be increasingly influenced by algorithmic trading reacting only to the momentum of the price which in this case was up the robots began buying coins giving an additional force to this momentum soon after it became known about the reduction of tension around iran and that the information about 500 million is just a fake the price of bitcoin went down dropping to 7 765 then went up again reaching the height of 8 100 by the evening of friday january 10 as a result of these events the growth of bitcoin starting from january 03 was at a maximum of about 17 ethereum eth usd the same 17 ripple xrp usd 22 and litecoin ltc usd 27 at the same time the total capitalization increased by 10 and the bitcoin crypto fear greed index is another three points closer to its neutral position reaching 41 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of experts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd starting from november 29 2019 the pair moved on an upward channel on december 31 it reached its upper limit at 1 1240 and then changed direction opening the year 2020 with a gap down on january 08 it broke through the lower border of the channel at the level of 1 1125 but due to negative data on the labor market in the united states the bears could not consolidate their success and the pair finished the week session almost at the level of the breakdown will it return to the limits of the ascending channel 60 of experts do not think so in their opinion the dollar will continue to strengthen and the pair is expected to decline to the zone of 1 1040 1 1065 the next goal is 1 1000 graphical analysis on h4 and the majority 70 of trend indicators on d1 agree with this development the readings of trend indicators on h4 and oscillators on h4 and d1 can be considered neutral at the moment according to the forecasts of the remaining 40 of analysts the eur usd pair will not be able to break through the support at the level of 1 1100 and it will return at least to the central line of the ascending channel which will be in the zone of 1 1240 of course the trends of the coming week may be affected by the escalation of tension around iran but no extra surprises should probably not be expected from the publication of macroeconomic indicators on tuesday thursday and friday data on the us consumer market will be published on january 16 we will also learn the values of the german hicp consumer price index which is projected to remain unchanged the report on the ecb s monetary policy meeting may be more interesting it will also be published on thursday 16 january gbp usd the uk is less than three weeks away from parting with the european union according to bloomberg to date brexit has already cost the country 170 billion and by the end of 2020 london will lose another 90 billion the annual economic growth has halved from 2 to 1 the british economy is now 3 smaller than it could be if the relations with the eu had remained at the same level the uk economy is lagging behind the g7 countries and according to some economists it has a long way to recover in the near future the pound is highly likely to still move in a fairly wide side channel 1 2900 1 3200 with a pivot point in the zone 1 3000 1 3050 at the same time according to 60 of analysts supported by 85 of indicators on h4 and d1 the pair will continue to move to its lower border in the coming week supports are 1 3010 1 2970 and 1 2900 the remaining 40 of experts in agreement with the graphical analysis on d1 believe that the pair on the contrary will break away from the central zone and is likely to reach the december 31 2019 high at the height of 1 3285 according to the indications of graphical analysis it may take about four or five days after which it will return to the pivot point usd jpy last week the pair not only returned to the borders of the medium term side channel 108 40 109 70 but also reached its upper border although 75 of oscillators and 85 of trend indicators are colored green only 25 of experts believe that the pair will be able to rise to the height of 110 70 the majority of analysts 75 side with the bears as well as 15 of the oscillators on h4 and d1 signaling the pair is overbought supports are109 20 108 75 and 108 40 reaching the last week s lows in the 107 65 107 75 zone is unlikely cryptocurrencies we have already written that according to tradeblock only 30 of btc coins in 2019 were in motion the remaining 70 are in wallets in a frozen state similar figures were received by delphi digital according to its data at least 59 of bitcoins purchased in the second half of 2017 have not moved anywhere that is their holders did not sell their cryptocurrency even in december 2017 when btc soared to 20 000 on some trading platforms such data suggests that a stable layer of so called holders has formed in the cryptosphere who do not part with their coins even when the market is growing aggressively perhaps they are waiting for 2040 when according to the calculations of benjamin cowen the price of bitcoin can reach 1 million according to cowen the history of the main cryptocurrency price shows that the market cycles are getting longer it took 2 5 years to reach the first peak and 4 years to reach the second peak extrapolating the model of logarithmic regression to the price of bitcoin the expert suggests that it would take about 5 5 years to reach the next peak after the peak of december 2017 and in 2023 the price of bitcoin could reach the 100 000 mark and the bitcoin of 1mln cannot be earlier than 2040 at the same time of course there is another opinion according to which under pressure from regulators bitcoin will go into oblivion and it will be replaced by state and regional digital money the ecb has started thinking about developing its own cryptocurrency the brics countries are contemplating a single cryptocurrency and the bank for international settlements has already held the first summit of g20 central bankers which discussed the idea of a global cryptocurrency but all this is a matter of the distant future in the meantime the highs and lows of the past week allow us to say that the btc usd pair has moved to a new level of 7 765 8 450 with a pivot point in the 8 000 8 100 zone at the same time only 30 of analysts believe that it will be able to stay in this corridor while 70 expect it to fall to the 7 000 7 500 zone

democratic candidate who understood how the economy works but what he mostly demonstrated is that he knows how the financial sector allocates capital which is how he made his 1 billion plus fortune as founder of farallon capital the board questioned him on the company s investment in for profit prisons and companies accused of union busting he said he got out of those investments and left the firm several years ago to devote himself to political causes and he has pledged to give away most of his fortune during his lifetime the one question that most threw him off stride was how given his wealth and background he could hope to persuade voters that he is the right person to address income inequality well then i won t win if you re right he said here is a transcript annotated in blue of the 90 minute discussion on dec 3 which was filmed for a special episode of the weekly the times s tv show on fx and hulu the transcript is unedited kathleen kingsbury o k welcome many of us in this room have not actually had the chance to sit down with you before so our questions over the next 90 minutes are going to be focused on trying to get to know you a little bit better i was going to start by asking you what is a big question in your assessment what are the policy breakdowns that have led to there still being americans who are hungry today um kk like i said an easy one being hungry well i think that if you look at where i think it comes from where people are living i d start with when i think about hunger in the united states i think about young people i m sitting here thinking about it when i was in north carolina last year about a year ago the week before the 18 elections i was talking to young people who were organizing for us on campuses and a young 20 year old a 20 year old young woman told me that one of her two big issues was food insecurity and it turned out and i followed up on it it turned out that 18 percent of the people in the 32 counties around greensboro n c were hungry and i found that out by going to the food bank there and talking about what people were doing in order to supply food to those people so the question s not what were they doing about it in order to make sure that people actually didn t starve the question was why were they in that position in the first place i think if you look at inequality in the united states of america which is where food insecurity is coming from in terms of income but particularly for young people i think that you know we have a system where we have chosen not to provide services across the board to low income people in this country for a variety of reasons some 37 million people across america were food insecure in 2018 according to the united states department of agriculture one challenge in addressing this is that many who need government assistance don t qualify for it an estimated 25 percent of food insecure people most likely do not qualify for federal aid the country s most important anti hunger program is the supplemental nutrition assistance program known both as snap and food stamps which some democratic contenders including senator elizabeth warren hope to expand it s impossible to look at inequality without looking at race in the united states of america it s impossible to look at inequality without thinking about housing but what i ve seen in terms of food insecurity specifically and i ll talk about my home state of california is we see that it s particularly acute for school aged kids and for young people i know that we have a program my wife and i have built a program called california food for california kids which started with a single school district doing farm to table in an elementary school in pescadero calif it s now in a third of the public schools in california basically doing subsidized farm to table fresh food replacing because kids are hungry what we ve seen is you know it s related to money the number of kids in california i think it s almost 50 percent are on free and reduced lunch but in addition to that it s not a question of just lunch it s also a question of breakfast dinner weekends summer and what food they re actually getting a new trump administration rule changing snap eligibility for able bodied adults ages 18 to 49 could threaten nearly 700 000 individuals access to benefits particularly in california while california food for california kids is an important program serving over 309 million school meals a year through its california thursdays program it isn t a replacement for government programs tackling the challenge of widespread hunger so when we look at you know what we re trying to do farm to table is by definition supposed to be healthy food we re trying to do the food that is prepared on site that is not processed or minimally processed and getting kids in the public schools enough calories to be both healthy and to be able to perform at a different level particularly in the afternoon after lunch so where do i think it comes from i think it comes from a lack the distribution of resources in this society and i think that you look at particularly single parent households with kids and you see levels of poverty in particularly young people that are off the charts kk that s a very noble program that you re describing and actually leads very well into our next question mara gay sure mr steyer the center call me tom please watch a special endorsement episode of the weekly this video excerpt has been edited by the weekly mg o k thanks tom the center for responsive politics has estimated that the hundred million dollars you plan to spend on your campaign could fully fund five senate races do you truly believe that running for president is the best use of your wealth mr steyer plans to fund his bid with 100 million of his own money in addition to outside donations as of late december he had spent about 83 million in ad buys during the 2017 2018 election cycle he was the second biggest donor to democratic candidates and liberal causes also according to the center for responsive politics as i m sure you know since you work for the new york times and have done your research i started one of the biggest grass roots organizations in the united states nextgen america and we in 2018 did the largest 2 i think in american history i also have a partnership nextgen has a partnership with national labor unions to go door to door called for our future we also do it separately under a different name in california but i think we knocked on over 15 million doors in 2016 and over 10 million doors last year both of those grass roots organizations are ongoing in fact i m not legally allowed to run them as long as i m running for president but i continue to support them and they re doing the work nextgen america said it registered more than 257 000 young voters in 2018 rock the vote registered nearly 700 000 voters in 2014 do i believe that we will be doing an enormous amount of work specifically on the swing senate races in the united states of america why yes i do do i know that for sure well no i don t because i m not running them and i m not allowed to talk to them mr steyer is presumably talking about nextgen here but i believe if you go look and see where nextgen is i ll be shocked if they re not in arizona colorado iowa maine north carolina what are the other swing senate races in answer to your question it s not a question of either or mg how much would you like to see them spend on senate races nextgen america s leadership has said it will invest 45 million on youth voter turnout ahead of the 2020 election i don t know jesse wegman mr steyer i need to ask i mean your values are admirable the efforts that we all know about and the ones that you re even describing today which i hadn t known as much about are impressive your diagnoses of a lot of these problems are also very accurate we don t have any issue with any of that and i think i m still trying to get my head around why you think you re the right messenger at this moment for those values and for the next four and possibly eight years of this country s future o k i think that s a very fair question i ll give you three quick answers one is i m the person in this race who has by far the most well i put by far the highest priority on climate who has spent the most time actually working on it effectively for more than a decade who has a history on it who has a plan actually when you i don t know if you guys read the wall street journal editorial page this morning but they had a piece i think their second their third editorial was about nancy pelosi going and saying we re still in and then talking about climate projection if we actually are going to do something about climate i believe i m the person who s going to do it that s the first point because i think i m the person who s going to do it regardless of whether the congress passes mr steyer unveiled a plan last summer to tackle climate change which focuses on declaring a national emergency while rolling out protections for low income communities and low wage workers declaring an emergency could allow the use of military funds for climate action and might also pressure congress to pass legislation more swiftly kk but there s literally no democratic candidate who doesn t have climate as one of their key priorities in their platform agreed i know kk you think it s because of your history that i think it s not their no 1 priority and they never would say it s their no 1 priority and i will and i think that that s completely different if you actually look at the history of what people get done and if you and you know i don t think we need to go past president obama his no 1 priority running clearly was health care gov jay inslee of washington is widely seen to have helped set a policy benchmark with his campaign s singular focus on climate change of the remaining candidates few have been explicit about establishing climate change action as an absolute top priority though most have endorsed some version of the green new deal kk right people talked about it for the two years before the election and then we spent two years passing it never got to climate i mean he did a lot of stuff by executive action in the six seventh and eighth years of his presidency but watch a special endorsement episode of the weekly this video excerpt has been edited by the weekly john broder in the first year of his presidency the house passed his cap and trade bill and then it was killed in the senate never really got to the senate it never held a foot in the senate senate democrats dropped their cap and trade bill in july 2010 having failed to line up the 60 senators they needed to support the bill jb right so in fact what really happened there was jb but have the politics in washington changed appreciably from 2009 on this issue the republicans gained a majority in the 114th senate elected in 2014 mr trump has rolled back at least 90 environmental rules and regulations since the start of his administration if you look and see what my plan is it doesn t depend on passing something through the senate and the house jb well that s if you could look and let me say this to the new york times editorial board we don t have a choice on this you re asking me why i think i m the best i m the person who knows we don t have a choice on this and will do it second thing is look i don t think this is common wisdom i actually think this government s broken really if you look and see the issues we re dealing with we have a government that is not working for the united states and you can look at so many different issues and see it s true you can look at immigration reform we have 11 to 13 million people living in this country without documentation it s been they re here for an average of 15 years everybody knows they re here it s an open secret we have no action on it you can look at gun violence you can look at the cost of health care you can look at a trillion dollar deficit with full employment you can go just down the line you cannot tell me this government is working on the basic stuff of government a 2018 poll from the knight foundation and georgetown university found that 60 percent of those surveyed were not satisfied with american democracy jw but again there are multiple candidates already in this race the premise of whose candidacy is literally that that american government is a corrupt government how do you distinguish yourself kk also to mara s question the fastest way that you re actually going to do any of those things that you just listed is to have the senate flip to democrats which we re working on nextgen america is launching a youth mobilization effort for progressive 2020 senate candidates but mr steyer was legally required to step away from his formal leadership role in the organization to run his campaign kk o k i said you re absolutely right and we re doing it it s not a question of me not doing that i am doing that it s not either or tom steyer right campaigning at the iowa state fair alex edelman agence france presse getty images michelle cottle so going back to the question of broken government which you know everybody agrees that s what trump got elected on what is it that you plan to do that s different to fix i m willing to actually change washington mc but how and here s the answer if you look at what i ve said i ve said i would push for term limits for congresspeople and senators i would push for direct democracy that we d actually have a national referendum i think what we ve see i do all the other stuff too public funding of elections end of citizens united make it much easier to vote and end voter suppression yeah i do all of that stuff that everybody else is doing too no one else will actually talk about changing the structure of washington d c really they won t even say they re against it people won t even say they re against term limits nearly every democratic contender has proposed structural changes in government last summer at least seven candidates promised that their first legislation would be focused on cleaning up government senator warren said as early as last february that her first bill would be an anti corruption one kk but changing the structure of washington d c in a lot of ways even things that you ve just said would require actually changing the constitution you know and i think we ve seen how hard that is with the equal rights amendment for instance how long has it been since the united states has passed a new amendment the last time a new amendment was passed was 1992 with the 27th amendment it essentially states that a sitting congress can t raise or reduce its pay for the current session maybe the equal rights amendment gets its 38th state in january the equal rights amendment was first proposed nearly a century ago and was passed by congress in 1972 it requires ratification by 38 states and currently has 37 having been ratified by nevada in 2017 and illinois in 2018 with democrats in power in virginia s state legislature it could become the final state needed to sign off on the amendment the amendment reads equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex kk yes in a state where women spent i would say kk after 50 years more than 50 years in the making lauren kelley 100 years yeah but i think the question in the united states is going to be and the presidential election is a huge question is what is the issue in the united states what is the issue that s what the presidential election is about that s why when president obama was running he said the issue is health care so that s what people dealt with and that s actually what happened i m saying that there are two issues here climate and failed government and the question i would ask you guys is who really wants to change washington d c i have spent a decade running props and building grass roots organizations taking on the companies who i believe actually get their way in washington d c who are getting their way in climate change there s a reason we ve never had a climate change legislation passed in washington d c because oil and gas companies don t want it people think it s more complicated than that it s not more complicated than that congress has a yearslong history of failed legislative attempts to address climate change from failure to expand cap and trade in 2003 and a year of talking but no action in 2007 after the supreme court ruled that carbon dioxide was a pollutant to another abortive effort to pass broad climate legislation in 2009 10 jw there s no question you re right about that and there s no question that your diagnoses of some of the major problems are right but again to bring it back to the question of you as the messenger i know you don t like comparisons to donald trump and i think that s fair to a degree but we ve seen over the last three years how a businessman with literally no experience in elected politics has run the country you know you ve talked about running for governor of california you ve talked about running for the senate those seem like great ways to get a degree of experience in a huge important state that you live in and that you ve already done amazing work in why would you not go that route before trying to take on the highest office mr steyer reportedly considered a california senate run in 2016 and a gubernatorial bid in 2018 and even recorded a commercial for the governor s race before deciding against a candidacy i don t think anyone else has the third thing i ll say is this i m the person here who actually understands economics and understands what makes the country run economically i think i say completely different things i think completely differently i don t think anybody else in this race actually is talking about growth or what will make america prosperous and equitable everybody s talking about changing the tax rules and government programs actually what s important if this is going to come down to the economy then the question is what are we actually going to do to make this a number of democratic candidates have put forth plans focused on prosperity and economic growth from mayor pete buttigieg s economic agenda for american families to senator warren s wealth tax plan which she has maintained would benefit the economy kk well we actually have a lot of questions about the economy aisha do you want to kick us off aisha harris yes thanks tom say i m an 18 year old voter and i am disillusioned by capitalism and the way in which this economy is running and i see someone like you a rich older white man pitch me as to why i should trust you to be our president mr steyer s net worth is 1 6 billion according to forbes magazine look unchecked capitalism s failed i completely agree the question is what are we going to do to make it work for the people of the united states i think the answer is we can t give up on growth but what we have is so shockingly inequitable that to me your argument is exactly right and it proves that in fact what i m saying about broken government is true this system is now for 40 years you can look at the data and see this system isn t trying to serve the people of the united states specifically you mr steyer s campaign has released a platform that aims to rein in unchecked capitalism by repealing citizens united raising the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour and placing a wealth tax on those whose net worth is more than 32 million in the october democratic debate he sparred with senator bernie sanders senator warren and former vice president joe biden on the question of whether billionaires should exist mr sanders has said billionaires should not exist while mr biden has cautioned against demonizing wealth ah how would you what specifically would you do i m an 18 year old voter i need details you re an 18 year old person the first question is i come at it in a bunch of different ways let s just start with the easy part which is tax this is a system which has changed the tax rules for rich people and big corporations and giving them gigantic tax breaks on the assumption that government doesn t work government doesn t matter government support of people and investment in people doesn t matter i proposed a wealth tax way over a year ago long before i was running for president because there s something that s gone crazy in income but even more so in terms of wealth and assets in 2017 mr steyer published an op ed in the los angeles times headlined i m a billionaire please raise my taxes he has repeatedly said that he was one of the first candidates to introduce a wealth tax proposal ahead of senators warren and sanders though of course he is also the only one of those touting the tax who himself has profited from america s vast concentration of wealth i would undo the republican tax cuts for high income individuals and for big corporations i don t think it makes any sense i think it s wrong and the assumption there is that it trickles down somehow and it clearly doesn t we have 40 years of data we also have the returns in terms of investment by corporations to see whether in fact the claim that if they cut those taxes there would be more investment there wasn t the first question is about taxes i think that the way that we do taxes is unequitable but it goes across the board and those are just two specific examples the second question is about how what we think what prosperity is in the united states and it specifically relates to you my opinion is the way that the united states is going to be prosperous is for you to prosper really the united states is the people of the united states that we think we describe government programs as spending but they re actually investment that actually if we re going to prosper as a country you re going to have to prosper what does that mean it means we re going to have government programs that enable you to reach your potential it s a huge issue for you brent staples and they are what i think they start with food we started with food so let s include the idea that you need to actually have enough calories in a healthy way i m a gigantic believer in spending a lot more money on education and viewing that as investment in people i m a big believer in investing in research i m a big believer in investing in health care i view honestly the way we think about money in the government in the united states is wrong and i think that if we re going to actually be prosperous in five years and your life is going to be what you hope it is you re going to need government support in the 21st century period and so we should do that because it s really good for you and it s really good for everybody your success is success for everybody in the united states and we should take that attitude mr steyer s plan for health care involves a public option but not the medicare for all proposal advanced by senator sanders and senator warren bs can you drill down on the same column here we had a front page story this morning about how school reform in the united states has not narrowed the achievement gap between america and the leading countries in europe and asia i was present at the creation of no child left behind the subsidiary reforms and one argument for not spending more money on education is that you could be spending money in a system that s not doing its job and won t make any difference whatsoever basically it s the front page story this morning so it s very topical what is your idea about k 12 in recent decades america has tested a range of different education reform plans no child left behind race to the top the common core state standards the every student succeeds act but as dana goldstein reported for the times american high school student performance in reading and math has been stagnant since 2000 and the reading achievement gap between the highest and lowest performers continues to widen money is necessary but not sufficient in terms of education i think we all know that but let s be clear in many parts of this country there isn t remotely enough money being spent and it s not being spent in a way that s actually equitable if you think about how we fund education in the country it s mostly by local property taxes mr steyer s campaign hasn t released many details about his education reform plans mr steyer led the board of the opportunity institute a nonprofit organization that researches policy solutions to education inequities especially in early childhood bs that s right that means legislating inequality bs one in every eight dollars is federal something like that yeah we got to start with that fact bs that s sort of baked into our system i understand but we re talking here about what we should be doing if you go to the red states and look at states where republicans control the legislature and the governorship they always start by cutting taxes and the second thing they do is cut education so when you say there s enough money this country is very unequal between states in terms of how that money is raised how much is raised and how it s spent my opinion about education is simple do we require more money yes we do is that enough absolutely not but i think we have to treat teachers differently i also think we need much broader goals in terms of what we re trying to accomplish if you look at the places in the united states where the education actually is world class where they actually have changed the system where it s actually worked and massachusetts unfortunately i say as someone from california who grew up in new york is the one that i think is the best they did increase the money across administrations over a period of time they also had a much broader mandate of what they re trying to achieve in education massachusetts has the best public education outcomes of any state in the country still the massachusetts education equity partnership s 2018 report found that it is home to glaring and persistent disparities in opportunity and achievement that separate low income students and students of color from their peers in fact fewer than one in three black and hispanic fourth graders is at grade appropriate reading levels bs actually what they did as a person who paid some attention to this one of the differences between us and a place like finland or a place like shanghai they expect a lot more of teachers in finland in particular the teacher training is a lot more rigorous we have a teacher training system that s mediocre and varies wildly teacher training is terrible here i m trying to get at something a 2010 report from mckinsey closing the talent gap found that one of the reasons that education inequities remain so ingrained in american public schools is the low prestige and salary awarded to teachers in other countries like finland the country s top performing students are recruited into the teaching corps in america by contrast the teaching corps largely draws from the bottom third of graduates education reform therefore could require cultural change not just financial incentives but my point is do we need more money yes we need to treat teachers differently the question is what do you think the role of a teacher is how significant in society do you think it is i think we treat it exactly the way you re saying we pay teachers poorly some places incredibly poorly the training is insufficient and in addition ongoing education is different i think if you look at the places that crush it from an educational standpoint around the world teachers are viewed as the stewards of the future it s like being a lawyer or a doctor or an architect we re going to have to do that if we want to be world class in education that means we re going to think differently about the role of a teacher in society how important it is because i actually do believe that the way the united states will prosper is by an 18 year old actually getting the support to achieve what she or he can do we re not doing that we are clearly not doing that and we are not seeing that way to me long term in the united states if we re going to be successful and prosperous we re going to have to build the capability of the american people nearly all the 2020 candidates support raising teacher pay but not all have offered specifics some candidates like senator cory booker propose giving teachers tax credits senator sanders would work with states to set a minimum starting salary for teachers and senator warren s plan would quadruple title i funding and incentivize states to increase teacher pay mr steyer s campaign has released few detailed plans on education reform kk can we get back if you don t mind to some of the levers of wealth inequality paul volcker once asked the nobel laureate william sharpe what the rise of finance in the late 20th century had contributed to overall economic growth sharpe s answer was nothing what s wrong with the view that hedge funds and private equity where much of your money comes from are simply collecting tolls from everyone else mr steyer began his career working in mergers and acquisitions for morgan stanley then founded his firm farallon capital in 1986 if you think about what the role of financial system in the united states or anyplace else is it s to allocate capital right that s the job to figure out on a micro basis what is worth investing in it s measured in terms of returns in dollars but that s the job of finance if you look at the united states of america and think about how we do money allocation in this society bill sharpe was i believe a professor at the stanford business school which i attended kk yes so i actually had a chance to talk to bill sharpe i think that s untrue i think that capital allocation in this society actually turns out to be critical in fact if you actually look at why the soviet union failed if you ll excuse my saying so really bad capital allocation they did central planning by people in a room figuring out where to put capital and where to do things and they totally failed and the united states of america has huge issues in terms of fairness it has huge issues in terms of what values are promoted i believe that the financial system does not have the rules it needs so we started a community bank that is from zero to over a billion dollars designed for economic justice environmental sustainability and to support businesses owned by women and people of color i definitely agree that there are gigantic holes and unfairnesses and discrimination in our financial system but in terms of do i think that the skillful and professional allocation of capital in this society is a critical function for growth yes mr steyer and his wife kathryn taylor founded a community development bank beneficial state bank which uses loans to support projects like affordable housing and renewable energy ms taylor called banking the most powerful form of crowdfunding the national diversity coalition accused beneficial state bank of running a predatory consumer loan program that targeted subprime borrowers binyamin appelbaum by the eve of the financial crisis more than 40 percent of profits in this economy were being earned by the financial industry is that excessive in your view hugely gigantically farallon capital management mr steyer s hedge fund peaked at 36 billion in assets in 2008 before the start of the recession mr steyer stepped away from finance in 2012 he told forbes that he feared that his grandchildren would ask when we were completely screwing it up grandpa what were you doing and he would have to respond well i was running my business ba some of that was you right some of that was farallon which was mr steyer and his wife made 1 2 billion between 2009 and 2017 one of his most profitable years was 2012 when he sold his stake in farallon capital and made 174 million you know what i took the giving pledge to give away most of my money while i m alive ba i understand that but do you think that the profits you were earning were excessive do you think that the role of the financial industry has become distorted in the economy yes but do i think that professional skillful capital allocation is critical to a growing society yes i do and i think that anyone who doesn t think that should take a look at the societies that do it poorly and see how it works out ba at farallon you also benefited from the current tax system in 2000 farallon sent a letter to investors telling them it would use an offshore company to shelter some of their gains from taxation could you please explain why you did that and what role you think such tax shelters should play look do nothing you can take a look at my taxes and see how clean i am the farallon lawyers and i m not trying to pass it off on them farallon did tax planning for its clients according to the laws of the united states of america do i agree with those laws no you can take a look at my taxes and see what i do do i think that s the way it should be no those are the laws of the united states do i think they should be changed sure i do tax laws of the united states in my mind massively advantage people who make a lot of money and that s a clear example of and i d change em according to the los angeles times mr steyer wrote a memo to investors in 2000 telling them that their money would flow through an offshore company for tax purposes mr steyer s tax records also show that he has made millions investing in companies headquartered in the cayman islands bermuda and china ba you ve also expressed regret for farallon s 2005 investment in the corrections corporation of america could you talk a little bit about whether you think other people should be able to invest in private prisons do you think that that was a mistake that you did it or that should be a function of government when i made that decision when we looked at it the only question in my mind is whether this is a decent thing to do before the question was this theory that it would be a more efficient service privately delivering high quality more literally giving prisoners better service after a couple of months i thought no this is just wrong you shouldn t be making money out of this under any circumstances and i don t believe it in the first quarter of 2004 mr steyer s hedge fund bought 53 100 shares of stock in the corrections corporation of america now corecivic then the country s biggest private prison firm now second largest according to politico the shares were worth about 1 89 million a year later farallon increased its holding to 5 5 percent of the outstanding stock 2 27 million shares valued at nearly 90 million yale graduate students called on their university to divest from farallon because of its ties to c c a and mr steyer responded in a march 2004 letter defending his firm and stating we are proud of the work we have done and continue to do ba there should not be private prisons no i don t think you should be making money out of prisons i don t like it that s why i sold it then that was whatever it was 14 years ago i made that decision when this was not a big issue when i was not running for anything because i thought it was wrong and it was a mistake so i sold it and got rid of it for moral reasons because i don t think it s right to make money from that mr steyer s fund sold its shares in c c a in 2006 when questioned on the fund s investments in c c a mr steyer said we heard the concerns of student leaders and in the end farallon chose to sell the stock ba the overarching question we ve come at it in a number of ways but you re an investor who s profited massively from an industry that you say has grown too large you ve taken advantage of tax shelters that you say you want to close you re a billionaire in a society that you say is dealing with profound wealth inequality how can you be the person who s best to fix the problems that are really embodied by you i think what i m doing and what i have a history of doing this isn t like i just came to this i ve been doing this for a decade do i think that all those things you re saying are true yes am i someone who s actually worked on that yes am i someone who s taken a pledge to give most of my money away while i m alive yes look it s exactly like saying you ve been driving a car for 60 years how can you be someone who s leading on climate change because we have to make a change as a society and am i part of that society sure and have i lived in that society and participated in that society and run my life according to the rules sure i have my point is those rules should change not just for me but for everybody i ve changed and i m asking everybody else to go make the same change i ve made ba how is that different than expecting exxon to take the lead on solving climate change why would we trust them to do that because they haven t spent a decade actually turning themselves inside out to make sure that happened i have a history of doing this if you look at the people in the race the person in this race who has done by far the most on climate is me the person who knows the most about it and has actually accomplished things in it and spent time and effort and money making sure it happens is actually me so it s not a question of exxon exxon has a history that s exactly the opposite mr steyer s work on climate change began in 2013 when he founded his environmental advocacy group nick fox given what happened in 2008 how can you say that the financial industry in any way allocates capital efficiently and given what s happened since i think what i said is that it allocates capital efficiency but it has gigantic the rules that control it are wrong look if you look at the mortgage crisis you can see gigantic fraud short term and an absolute inability to control itself so do i believe the financial industry should be running without the rules from government no we started a bank that s over a billion dollars because we believe the financial industry isn t serving the needs of the american people the way i outlined them economic justice environmental sustainability and supporting businesses owned by women and people of color because that isn t what the financial industry has been doing do i think that the rules should be different yes i do nf but there were rules excuse me nf there were rules there were laws that were violated and since then people who have tried to change the rules if not broken bent look one of the things i said was i believe corporations have bought this government there is no industry that has its hooks more into our government than the financial industry if you ask me when i look back at 2008 one of the overwhelming facts is that nobody was criminally prosecuted to me that s wrong why did the financial crisis result in so few criminal convictions former attorney general eric holder said it has not been as a result of a lack of effort the author william cohan summed it up wall street bankers make it their daily business to figure out ways to abide by the letter of the law while violating its spirit bs who would you have prosecuted well i think there was massive fraud in the mortgage industry bs i mean a name company what look i think all the people who were making those teaser mortgages were clearly taking advantage of people clearly did they have a piece of paper that on page 68 laid out all the risks yes did anyone get to page 68 no bs i was here for it and so do i believe that they were playing on the financial inexperience and lack of education of americans across the board absolutely do i think that they were telling the truth no do i think they were breaking the law yes i do think they were breaking the law i don t understand why people didn t get prosecuted for it nf are you talking about the top executives at places like bs countrywide or morgan chase sure nf i m not talking about countrywide like jpmorgan chase 35 billion do i think that jpmorgan chase were breaking the law yes i do think so nf right and do i think that it would completely change behavior if people in corporations were criminally prosecuted yes completely change behavior nf let me ask you something i think that there s something going on here really where look i was at an editorial board where they literally said to me you don t really think that the oil companies will let you do something about climate i said yeah i really do they re like well you re kidding yourself it s a pipe dream mr steyer s fund historically invested in fossil fuel projects including a large coal mine in australia mr steyer s evolution on fossil fuels has been slow and ongoing according to the washington post in 2012 he declared that he would stop all ecologically unsound investments that year he divested his personal holdings from tar sands and coal and he extended that to natural gas and oil in 2013 nf given farallon s investments in companies like fedex and target and comcast that are well known for resisting unions why should the average american worker have any faith in you and do you think unions need to be stronger in this country union tensions hung over mr steyer s campaign launch when nextgen s staff union released a statement criticizing its management for siding with the g o p s union busting tactics by stalling on its response to the employees terms for union recognition i do think they need to be much stronger and i ve spent over a decade partnering with unions and not just going door to door with them but in every single proposition i ve ever run we ve had union support my attitude is working people have been screwed for 40 years mr steyer has made vague promises to support unions but unlike many of his opponents he has not released a detailed plan on labor mayor buttigieg for example wants multimillion dollar penalties for businesses that interfere with union elections senator sanders has argued for the creation of a sectoral collective bargaining system beyond supporting a higher minimum wage it s not clear precisely how mr steyer plans to bolster unions nf and your earlier investments in companies that fought unions vehemently look when we were in the reason i left farallon i could ve stayed at farallon and got every single thing i m doing and they could have paid me a lot of money for being a symbolic leader and the reason i left was i needed to make a clean break with what i saw was a system that was off the rails you were asking me earlier what do i think about capitalism it s not working for people i agree and so i felt like i had to make a clean break not stay and get paid a bunch of money because there s something wrong here and actually i know how it works and how to change it mr steyer left farallon capital in 2012 announcing that it was time for him to give back nf i just get the feeling like your pitch is you made a lot of money you ve had a series of epiphanies you ve changed your mind and now you re spending your money in things that you believe and given the climate of the country now given the emphasis on inequality it doesn t seem like a very strong pitch to make to the average person well then i won t win if you re right kk i want to ask you actually about a different broken system you have called for the decriminalization of the border this policy is opposed by the vast majority of americans with so many other immigration issues to tackle why focus on that one well i ve said that but i haven t focused on that if you look at what i m saying about immigration if you look at my history in immigration i ve spent a bunch of money personally hiring lawyers for people who are under threat of deportation we ve hired lawyers we ve also attracted lawyers and we ve also helped people who are filling out their dream act renewal so in terms of immigration policy i do believe in decriminalizing the border but it s funny that you think i focused on it because i don t think i focused on it i think i focused on different things i think i focused on how we treat people who are seeking asylum to me the biggest question is what about the 11 to 13 million people who live here without papers and who have no legal status and where the government has done nothing about that for what is it thirty five years so i don t think i focused on it but i do believe in decriminalizing the border because i think criminalizing it has enabled the agencies involved to take approaches toward those people that i think are inconsistent with a decent law abiding country mr steyer has said he would push for a repeal of the criminal statute for entering the united states without authorization but he hasn t elaborated on his immigration plans in much detail his focus he has said has largely been on climate change health care and public education mg do you believe that michael bloomberg is a credible candidate for president i have said publicly that mike should come out for a wealth tax anybody who wants to be a representative of the democratic party has got to be dealing with inequality has got to not just acknowledge it but be talking about it in terms of not just incumbent in terms of wealth and assets and if he is then he has look i don t agree with mike on a lot of things but my idea is let him make his pitch to the american people and see if his message is one that they agree with mr steyer has taken jabs at his fellow billionaire candidate saying that mr bloomberg shouldn t run if he doesn t support a wealth tax because if he doesn t understand that inequality is at the heart of the problems in america he can t represent the democrats by mr steyer s estimations mg do you believe his apology on stop and frisk was sincere i don t know i read his apology on stop and frisk it was on the front page of the new york times i read the comments on it but that s not my job jb speaking of mr bloomberg he spent the better part of the last decade like you focusing on climate change he put a lot of money behind the beyond coal campaign and arguably was responsible for the closing of several dozen perhaps scores of coal plants how has your climate campaign been more effective than his first of all i like the beyond coal campaign i think that is a good campaign i think that if you look at what i ve done i ve actually pushed for a broader way of thinking in terms of climate than just coal that in fact what we ve been pushing for is if you think about what has to happen first of all you have to clean up your generation which coal deals with but it doesn t deal with exclusively there s other parts of generation so if you look at what i ve pushed for we ve pushed for 50 percent clean energy by 2030 to clean up generation also pushed to end fossil fuel expansion whether it be pipelines or fossil fuel plants including natural gas plants so i ve pushed to stop specific plants and specific pipelines beyond coal which is managed by the sierra club and largely funded by bloomberg philanthropies assembled a team of nearly 200 litigators and organizers to push for the closing of coal plants around the country since its start in 2011 some 299 plants have closed nextgen america mr steyer s organization ran digital ad and advocacy campaigns on a range of environmental issues i think we ve also pushed in california if you look at where the greenhouse gas emissions are actually coming from the no 1 is cars transportation in general so we pushed for a bunch of things that include public transportation to replace cars in addition to e v s across the board on that i think also if you really want to go and see what we re talking about we re also talking about industrial and agriculture we ve worked on both of those things i think it s easy i think people like to think about generation the basic goal is clean up generation electrify everything and do energy efficiency that s the basic program for the world so clean up generation is first but if you look across the spectrum of where greenhouse gases are coming from focusing entirely on generation isn t enough because you re seeing greenhouse gases come from across the spectrum and so we ve been working across the spectrum mg should major donors be made ambassadors i think it s obviously not turned out well i wouldn t do that mg fair enough turning to a slightly different subject should someone a candidate who hasn t energized voters become president and can they you guys are worried about something that can t happen the person who is going to become president is the person who gets the most votes jw not necessarily that s true too electoral votes o k touché touché mg this is a leading question the question is who has a message that s different important and is trusted to bring it home and that s the question and so that s what i spend my time trying to say is i think i have something different to say i didn t run because i thought somebody would say i disagree with you guys i don t think there s anyone else in this race who actually is going to do what s necessary on climate period i don t think that i think that people inside the beltway really don t want to change the way it works i think that and i think that lastly in terms of growth of this country the answer to your question is and we look nextgen is the biggest youth voter organizer the question of exactly what influence mr steyer s organization has on campuses and among youth isn t clear the group spent 38 million in 2018 mostly on reaching college students in swing states i ve asked hundreds of kids why they don t vote and they say exactly what you say no one tells the truth no one deals with my issues system s broken why would i participate doesn t matter to me but actually in my mind the success of that 18 year old and i m assuming you re not 18 i know that s going to be the success of the united states or not and when you actually think about how we re going to prosper what is going to be our capability it comes back to the questions you were asking how can we possibly prosper as a people unless we re actually supporting the growth of ourselves investing in the growth of ourselves it s actually how we re going and so the success of that 18 year old to me is critically important in terms of success in this country i don t see this as fiscal policy and monetary policy i don t believe that s not true that s a short term answer the real question for the united states is how capable how much capability how much productivity are we building into our country on a personal and commercial basis and that s a real question that we are not addressing that nobody addresses ah do you feel though like you are energizing the youth vote and how do you do that well i can tell you the way that we ve done it at nextgen is by literally trying to have as much personal contact wherever we can as possible and so i m a grass roots person that s why we are on 420 campuses that s why we do a ton of stuff on social media at nextgen so look we have done this do i think that my campaign started late so from a grass roots standpoint organizationally we aren t where we would be if we d started earlier it s true but there s no question in my mind that this election i believe will be won by that 18 year old i believe that this will be a turnout election where actually people between the ages of 18 and 35 turn out at completely different rates than what they ve turned out traditionally that s actually in my mind what happened to a large extent in 2018 i believe 2020 will be even more so i think this will be a generational election because people understand that actually there s a gigantic difference in what happens in this election not just for president but also for senate and i think everybody s going to get that while pollsters predict that the 2020 election could have record high turnout the times reporter nate cohn wrote that the democratic focus on low turnout progressives is largely misplaced whichever candidate the democrats select he wrote will have to reach the key constituency of less educated voters who don t agree with the party s cultural left charlie warzel do you think they ll buy it coming from you though the 18 year olds not to like keep harping on it but it really seems to be if you go spend a lot of time on these social media platforms and you see it s not the world at large but some are very good windows into that world and the disillusionment with the broken capitalist system is i think biggest for those who haven t even entered it yet do you see yourself connecting with those 18 year olds who if i don t then i won t get elected michelle cottle well a lot of our questions obviously about whether you re the right messenger your response has been that over the past decade you ve kind of shifted from where you were and have headed in a different direction and in some case tried to correct what you had seen as a problem so i have one that s not ancient history so you ve said you want to get corporate money out of politics you are i think the single biggest donor to progressive causes i think you re no 2 as an individual donor right behind sheldon adelson over all now getting big money out of politics was a big issue for democrats in the midterms why are you the right person for people to trust to handle this sort of issue well if you look at the money i ve spent it s overwhelmingly grass roots money if you look at what i ve done i ve said nextgen spend a bunch of money for a bunch of years trying to make sure that people are registered engaged and turn out if you look at 2016 nextgen organized the registration of 1 3 million americans predominantly people who were underrepresented that s why we went there so that was young people african americans and latinos low income communities because we said this system is not representative because these people are not participating at the same level as other people and so their voices aren t being counted so if you really look at what i ve done i have pushed really hard for props what is a proposition it s the vote of the people it s the actual turning over to the people some question that the legislature won t pass for some reason mr steyer has endorsed or poured funds into at least sixteen ballot propositions in california proposition 56 was a 2 per pack tobacco tax proposition 59 was an advisory measure to repeal citizens united proposition 67 was a ban on plastic grocery bags proposition 62 focused on death penalty repeal and proposition 57 was on criminal justice he also spent nearly 29 million on proposition 39 which aimed to close a corporate tax loophole mc so you re making a distinction in how the money gets spent not just the problem being the influence of their voices aren t heard but as the top progressive donor your voice is heard exponentially so you re drawing the line in terms of how the money is spent as opposed to money being the problem mr steyer who was recently the nation s largest democratic donor has been referred to as the left s answer to the koch brothers i am pushing for broader democracy and power to the people and do i trust the people and do i think that they make good decisions yes i do nf do you think that is though the experience of california with direct democracy because there seems to be one group of rich people fighting another group of rich people often i think everybody in california wishes the ballot didn t look like it looks like but i also think that in california we wouldn t have a functioning state without propositions and if you go back and look take a look at where all of the increase in taxes has come seriously we were bankrupt right we were paying people in scrip i mean i know that it was a recession but we were bankrupt prop 30 they didn t raise taxes in the legislature they raised taxes on the ballot prop 56 that didn t happen in the legislature prop 39 that didn t happen in the legislature every single one of the bills that has increased the revenue in the state of california with the exception of the gas tax which they deeply regret and now proves that they ll never do it again has happened on the ballot the california state constitution was amended in 1911 to allow for statewide ballot initiatives and referendums and the state has voted on more than 1 200 ballot initiatives since then bs wasn t that proposition 13 the sort of disaster bs the great great grandfather of all this is it not possible to see proposition 13 as the prima facie evidence of the sort of bankruptcy of the proposition idea it was definitely a terrible idea there s going to be a big push to undo prop 13 this year on the ballot i m sure you know that you know the so called split role it s going to be on the ballot and it s going to be probably the key proposition in california in 2020 so do i think look that s not the only bad proposition that got passed california s proposition 13 enacted in 1978 introduced sweeping changes to the state s property tax system leading to severe distortions in the real estate market bs but it was the grandfather of them there others that i would argue are almost there s one other that s almost as bad kk how would you assess how senator harris has done in representing california and your state that s for you guys to decide kk who s on your short list as your running mate you guys are funny bs we ask this question to everybody it s the same question as mc well how about look in my opinion if i am in fact the candidate whoever i would want as a running mate is someone with a completely different background from mine to make sure because i am a huge believer in disparate opinions and different backgrounds mc what factors would you look at are you talking geography ideology ah race mc race gender i m talking race gender ethnicity age everything look my opinion is that take a look at our staff take a look i m a believer that the most diverse group comes up with the best answers kk we want to ask you some more policy related questions jeneen do you want to kick us off jeneen interlandi i m going to make sure michelle s done i want to actually circle back to immigration really quickly during the l g b t q town hall with cnn you called for increasing oversight of health care access among l g b t q asylum seekers and i was wondering if you could elaborate on i did ji yes you did could you remind me what i said ji you said that you would increase oversight of health care access for l g b t q i m not sure i know what that means ji o k so then i guess you cannot elaborate on that i d like to see the language on that during cnn s equality in america town hall mr steyer was asked whether his administration would put in place stronger measures to protect the health of l g b t q asylum seekers he responded of course we will i mean what we ve seen from ice in terms of inhumanity this is a perfect example but it s not the only example i think it s absolutely critical for the united states of america to treat people in a humane and decent fashion ji o k let me put it to you more broadly can you talk a bit about what you would do to improve the health and safety of asylum seekers so in response to katie s earlier question you said you did not actually focus on decriminalization but you did say you had i m for decriminalization ji sure but you said it wasn t your focus but to me i m much more interested in the united states being a country that observes international law that it does not commit crimes against humanity that it is actually humane and efficient in their treatment of people coming here seeking asylum ji of course how would you go about doing that what steps would you take as president to increase just specifically the health and safety of asylum seekers because presumably anything we come up with for broad immigration reform is going to take quite a while and in the meantime there are many people being detained at the border in really just inhumane conditions so what steps would you take to improve so what ends up happening for asylum seekers is they come here they are treated very harshly and then released to whoever in the worst possible way everyone has a right to seek asylum in the united states of america the first thing we should do is process this much much faster we have people who are waiting an incredibly long period of time to be secondly obviously i m against separating families next they re getting zero support they literally are released onto the street at midnight with no money and no place to go ji well it s worse than that they re often taken and bussed very far away from where they are and i see in my home state of california that nonprofit organizations are stepping in to do what the federal government should be doing which is making their transition to the united states while they wait for their case to be adjudicated ji yes so as president how would you change that i would do the role that the a c l u that the jewish family foundation and that the other groups are doing to take in which is to treat them decently and to get them placed while they wait for their case to be adjudicated and the united states is specifically not doing that and treating them as harshly as possible as a way of preventing other people from wanting to come to the united states because they figured this is even worse than wherever they re coming from times reporting showed that as the trump administration has reduced its efforts to help migrant safety nonprofit organizations have had to step in and play a larger role ji sure and obviously that s wrong ji have you thought about specific policies you might have to enact or if there would be changes at department of health and human services s office of refugee resettlement i think that the organizations the departments that are in fact dealing unfairly with them and so the question you re implicitly asking is should we be shifting the departments that are dealing with it we have departments that are rogue departments that are dealing with immigration and asylum seekers in a way that is intentionally inhumane and obviously we have to change that and obviously we have to actually treat them humanely and get them do everything we can to get them settled safely in united states but we also need to have these cases handled much more quickly if you asked me should i hire a lot more judges and have this yeah look there s something going on here that is this is a legal situation they have legal rights we have legal obligations we re not living up to them kk i want to make sure we get we also have human rights i mean look it s amazing you guys are all americans i presume they are actually committing crimes against humanity in your name kk we have actually a lot of health care questions for you but i want to make sure we get to foreign policy so alex do you mind kicking us up on foreign policy and maybe we can come back if we have extra time ji absolutely alex kingsbury sure i want to sort of ask you about foreign policy and the military just to see sort of how you would approach things differently than the trump administration you can talk about ending the war in afghanistan the trump administration is negotiating with the taliban and seeming to kick the existing afghan government to the wind if they reach a deal with is that an appropriate approach for ending a war there well let s take a step back we ve been in afghanistan is the longest running war in the united states we re very concerned that when we leave we re going to leave a vacuum and there s going to be a lot of violence ensuing it s probably true and so when we think about what s going on the question is how can we you know what is the we made obviously we didn t understand exactly what we re getting into and we went in we didn t have a clear mission we tried to get something done and then we stayed and we stayed and we stayed because that is always going to be true so the question of afghanistan is what exactly are we trying to do what is the mission we re trying to accomplish and how are we going to end it and i think if you look at the united states of america we have been willing to commit troops without a clear plan of what we re trying to accomplish without a clear plan of how we re going to get out and unilaterally as opposed to as part of an actual international force and so as a result we re stuck we re in the same situation we ve been in before where we re basically the de facto peacekeepers in a country that has got gigantic internal strife the editorial board s interview with mr steyer was held before the washington post released its investigation showing that senior government officials failed to tell the truth about the war in afghanistan throughout most of its 18 year span james dao and is that wrong i mean what should our role in afghanistan be should it be to not be there at all or should it be there i think if we had a choice if we could not be in afghanistan right now we would not be in afghanistan right now or if we were there would it be part honest to god of an international coalition that was there for a peacekeeping mission but we would not be doing what we re doing now which is basically keeping the unilateral peacekeeper in a country where we i absolutely believe that i think that when we think about what we ve been doing we have obviously been too fast to move to military action we ve been not clearsighted in terms of defining the mission and how we re going to accomplish it and how we re going to end it we have there s no question about it i mean the question is how to do that better but there s no question that looking back that we have made gigantic mistakes ak well so we ve made mistakes but how do we get out of it that s the question the question is do we leave tomorrow or what whenever we leave in my opinion we re going to be leaving some broken glass behind us and the alternative is to stay forever yes ak so we should leave tomorrow no i think we re going to do what we can to get out and to leave it in as good a place as possible which means negotiating with the people on the ground doing everything we can to see if there s a way to bring in other international actors in a coalition to try and have things go but do i think that we re going to leave it in a perfect position no i don t i think that there s going to be the afghanistan having talked to afghanis who grew up there who now live in the united states about what it was like and what the situation actually is on the ground i think that in fact when we leave there is going to be a lot of conflict and i think that that s true and so we can either accept that as truth and deal with it and try and minimize it and try and do everything we can or we can stay forever those were our choices mr steyer s campaign website doesn t include detailed policy plans on afghanistan the middle east or other regional conflicts and his approach to international agreements has been largely framed in terms of climate change e g the international powering past coal alliance ak just a real quick question about the footprint of the u s navy it s a massive cost for our government can you tell me how many aircraft carriers we have and if that s an appropriate number given that our i have heard it but i don t recall it but i ll say this the u s navy is that unilateral force keeping over straits around the world so that shipping can go on specifically of oil the u s navy is the reach of the united states around the world to a large extent the navy has 11 aircraft carriers ak should it get bigger should it get smaller is it appropriately small i think there s a sense that the united states should be the world s controller for instance of all those straits so that oil can move around the world i m not sure that s true then i look at the united states i think we re moving to i would move to a much more coalition based foreign policy you re asking about the trump administration america first we just compete with people we have no allies we have no allegiances we have no values i don t believe that for a second i don t think that s how the world is working in fact you look at you can start with climate change we can t solve climate change we can t solve climate change unless we get a coalition of the world to solve climate change can t happen so when we think about what we re trying to do in the world by and large i think the exact same thing is true we can t do this role by ourselves can t do it so the question is how are we going to transition to a different world the world s going like this there s no doubt about it the question is how are we going to deal with that and how are we going to be a leader of coalitions based on values look i was talking to a ba what is the answer how do you get china to stop burning coal i think you may look it s like every negotiation what do you care about the question in dealing with other people is what do you care about and what are you willing to do about it kk so what s your assessment of what china cares about what would you bring to the table in those conversations look i think what china cares about is cheap energy and i think that at this point wind and solar is cheaper than coal and i think that they are going to suffer these people are not dumb if you take a look at who s going to suffer from climate i don t know if you guys have looked at that i mean probably you have o k the chinese and the indians are going to suffer in ways that are almost unimaginable so the real question is sitting down with china and saying how are we actually going to do this because it is in your interest and by the way coal plants are more expensive than wind and solar so the question is why would you want to do that and what can we do together to make sure that you don t do that but it s a question of priorities because if it s not your chief priority then that s not going to be the thing that you re going to be pushing on it s not going to happen but do i think that it s in the chinese country s and the chinese leaders interest to actually get on top of this yes and do they know it yes they do but honestly i ve looked at the coal numbers too the number of plants that they re talking about building i know how many plants they re talking about building not even in china but it is just part of the belt and road expansion the number s 350 so i m highly aware of what happens if everybody in the world builds the coal plants that they re talking about building and the united states closes our 237 coal plants jd could you talk more broadly about what you think our relationship with china should be we re a frenemy jd and define that what is that we re tied to them they re the second biggest economy in the world we don t want them to fail we want them to play by the rules they don t play by the rules so the question is what can we do to pressure them to obey the rules to be decent counterparties without trying to destroy them because we don t want to destroy them and to me a lot of questions in all these things is trust and relationship do people think that you actually are a fair trusted counterparty who tells the truth and is not trying to hurt them but is actually trying to cooperate in a way that is better for everybody jd is president trump wrong in taking as aggressive a stance as he does using tariffs and other yes he s wrong yes he s stupid yes it s stupid and failing jd well flesh that out for a minute there are many democrats who would say he s fundamentally heading in the right direction even if it s an instrument he s wrong it s not working it s not going to work they re cheating look do i know that they steal intellectual property yes do i know that they close markets to american companies yes has our tariff he s basically trying to create pain over there and pain over here so that they ll stop doing things look in my opinion we should be dealing more directly with the things they re doing that there should be a specific response on it that we d go after them and not by ourselves he s an america first person everybody s an individual actor promoting their own interests i don t believe in that that we re not the only people they steal intellectual property from we re not the only people they close markets to we should be going after this with a coalition of people who are also being treated unfairly by the chinese in terms of those things but the other thing that s true is we don t want the chinese to fail it s not good for us it s not good for the world it s definitely not good for us if china has a terrible situation which they could have look i m somewhat honest so i view them as a frenemy they do things that we really really really hate and we re tied to them very closely and if you think we re separating from china in a realistic way i beg to differ kk is president xi a dictator he is he doesn t have a term limit he wasn t elected i don t know what the definition of a dictator is but an unelected leader who has no term limit i don t know what that is it s not america i believe in democracy i m telling you i m a grass roots person who wants everybody s vote counted so do i like that no i don t like that but it s also mr steyer hasn t released detailed plans on china but said from an economic perspective we actually can t isolate ourselves from china kk so we have some questions on another close relationship of the president s serge schmemann yeah i was going to ask you i m sure you ve been learning a lot about ukraine as we all have in recent weeks about what the united states is doing should be doing is not doing what would you do would you consider sending more lethal weapons to ukraine to help them fight russia look the questions about ukraine are really questions about russia ss yep so we talk about ukraine but we re really talking about russia i have a different opinion about russia obviously than mr trump look i think these are guys they hacked our election they hacked brexit they re attacking democracy around the world in the 21st century people think that warfare is going to be people pulling up their gun ships and shelling washington d c i don t think so i think cyberwarfare is warfare so when i think about what russia is doing we re talking about how china cheats in terms of stealing intellectual property yeah they do close markets to us yes they do russia is a country that has actually attacked our basic system tried to overturn the basics of democracy in our country so when i look at what they re doing should we be pushing back on russia yes are they a hostile foreign power in my opinion they are ss does that include sending more lethal weapons say to ukraine i don t know i think in terms of having a policy of how we respond to russian aggression that question implies if you ll excuse my saying so once again a bilateral unilateral reaction i would not take this as a bilateral unilateral question to me when i say i actually believe in coalitions and allies of pushing forward together as opposed to the united states being the peacekeeper for the world i mean it and when i look at ukraine that s a perfect example of a place where i believe we should be responding with allies not by ourselves ss with brain dead nato i m sure you heard what macron said he said nato is brain dead do you think it can be brought back to life for this kind of coalition in november president emmanuel macron of france said nato was experiencing brain death because of a failure of strategic coordination by the united states i do look i think it s funny i was talking to an ambassadress from canada over thanksgiving and she was saying look it s like we have a team and the captain of the team has decided to quit the team whether we like it or not we re the captain of the team but we need a team and so when i think about ukraine the idea of the united states unilaterally dealing with this doesn t make sense to me it literally doesn t it s like that s an attitude that i think is going to get us to the wrong place almost by definition ambassadress is the female term for an ambassador used infrequently in media and politics kk may i ask how you ended up having thanksgiving with an ambassador she s a friend kk i actually have a question for you that s a little does that seem strange that i d have a friend kk it s not the average person ambassadors i actually have a personal question for you who has broken your heart who has broken my heart kk mm hmm o k so i would say a month ago i was in iowa talking to predominantly women working in mental health facilities who were being treated terribly they were being kk from that experience how would you help those women what was your takeaway look they re being mistreated across the board they weren t getting overtime pay they weren t getting raises they re underpaid they were getting physically abused and then fired for not coming back to work fast enough it was illegal for them to tell the truth outside their job function or they d be fired there was a treatment of working people in the united states that s wrong kk can you tell us a little bit about your relationship with god your spirituality do you believe in god i believe that i ve read that you ve recently become religious i do believe in god excuse me kk i ve read that you ve recently become more religious and more spiritual but correct that s not true kk o k that s not true if recently is 32 years ago then because seriously there s an implication with that question that somehow i m being manipulative that s not true kk oh i m sorry i didn t mean to imply that i m curious church and religion are the center of community for so many millions of americans who are your spiritual advisers how do you feel like that faith would inform your leadership i think it s a framework for value i think that i would never be doing this if i didn t believe in god i think that my definition of god is a positive life force in the universe and i think people get there in different ways i have my way of getting there i don t ask everybody to do it my way but i do think everybody has a responsibility to be part of that positive life force and so my way honestly is through going to church and using that time to reflect and be a framework for life but i don t ask everybody else to do that and i always say to people if there s a god what is the chance that he she it really decided that only one hill tribe in the middle east was going to be saved and everyone else was going to be damned i m going to go with zero so however some people say god great outdoors you can get there however you want but i believe that particularly now if you re not part of the positive life force then you re missing it that s the point of a meaningful life jd can i ask what happened 33 years ago i think i had kids mr steyer has four children mc so looking at the positive life force religion race immigration all of these are tools that the current president has to some degree used to divide the nation no question mc what steps would you take to heal this cultural divide because we ve talked some about policy and specifics i totally agree i totally agree bs can i come on top of that too before you answer look i think this is a huge question huge bs listen this president was elected with the most racist campaign in my lifetime except george wallace i was going to say bs o k except george wallace and that campaign had a broad appeal how do you run for office and win election but talking candidly about the broad constituency for racism in this country first of all i think we have to talk about race i don t think you can talk about the united states of america without talking about race i don t think you can talk about inequality in the united states without talking about race i ve been saying if i m president on the first day we re going to have a formal commission on race mr steyer hasn t been shy about calling mr trump a racist bs well listen i have told people all the time and i write all the time the united states does not have a race problem united states has a racism problem look and it s deep and if you look at the united states of america we ve never told the truth about what s happened here in our history we ve never apologized for slavery it s amazing we ve never been willing to go back and tell the truth i believe that policy comes out of narrative that actually ronald reagan got his policy through by telling a narrative that changed the way people think that was terrible including racist and so the question is how do we retell the narrative truthfully so we can get policies that actually address how we got here and make it fair and try and repair what s happened so when i think about what are we going to do to pull together first of all look i think winning really helps and i m not talking about winning an election i think as a country we have some huge tasks one is honestly to save the world people are unwilling to face the fact that we actually have to save the world and it has to be us and that if we do that it will make us better paid richer healthier we ll address some of the justice issues because environmental justice has got i mean i call my climate plan a justice based climate plan but doing that actually will pull us together the actual task together of building a sustainable world and passing it on and leading the world morally again is something that i actually believe will pull us together but i also believe we re going to have to be much more honest i think that the conversation about race specifically starting from the narrative but also talking about solutions as a result is something that s critical for us spiritually bs how much time have you spent in talking to white people in mississippi alabama south carolina south carolina i have bs talking to white people white democrats look i ve done the funny thing is look i ve traveled around this country full time for seven years i ve been organizing for 10 years but full time that s been what i ve done travel around the country and as a result of impeachment i traveled to all the red states now do i think that people who came to impeachment forums were a fair representative of those states no i don t but there were even in states like oklahoma georgia south carolina what i would think of as both deep red and deep south states lots of tons of white people so i ve had a chance to sit and talk to them yes mr steyer said he held at least 30 town halls across the country to make a bipartisan case for impeachment bs and look i started by saying i m not sure i got a representative group did the people who did it could i have a frank conversation with the people that i ve talked to who are probably overwhelmingly not exclusively but probably 80 percent democrats yes am i talking to the born again christians who believe that donald trump is an imperfect vessel sent by god to prepare us for the end of days yeah i ve talked to some have i talked to a lot no do i really think that the people at this table are going to convince them that he wasn t sent by god and that he s not preparing us for the end of days i don t think you guys are going to do that i don t think i m going to be able to do it there is something going on there that s deep ji mr steyer i want to circle back for a second you ve talked about making climate change your priority and that you re the only candidate that s been willing to do that and i appreciate you setting a priority i think that s a tough thing to get candidates to do particularly there s been a lot of i think wariness with health care policy has grown especially in the wake of the debates because it got so much airtime but the focus on that is predicated on some pretty dire needs and it didn t come out of nowhere that democrats chose to focus on that how do you make the case to voters who can t afford their insulin who don t have adequate health care for whom health care policy however boring it gets is actually a matter of life and death how do you convince those people that climate change needs to come first because to your earlier point whatever you focus on whatever you said is your priority is the thing that s going to get done obama got health care done because he didn t prioritize climate change the two things i ve said that i would do are climate change and break the corporate stranglehold on our government look the reason i think we have the health care system we do is because of the drug companies the private hospitals insurance companies so do i understand look i ve gone around this country i ve had people tell me without the affordable care act i d die i ve gone to the states where they haven t done medicaid expansion i see what it means for human beings i mean you guys may not believe it but i don t like being mean to people and i don t like people torturing people and taking away their i believe health care is a right for every american citizen just so you know so do i believe that i will do everything i m a competitive person what is going on with the american people is they re getting their ass kicked and this is a perfect example of the american people getting their ass kicked by corporations for money ji so again how do you make the case to people who are getting their ass kicked in all of these ways that climate change is the thing we re going to have to focus on during board deliberations ms interlandi lamented i kind of want to see what it would be like to have a candidate really strongly and emphatically make the case for climate change as the priority no one does that that was your moment to convince me convince everybody say that no one has ever done that everybody goes with health care of course as mentioned above governor inslee made climate change a central part of his platform before bowing out because what i m going to do is i m the person who s going to say there s two things i m going to do climate change and break this corporate stranglehold if we break the corporate stranglehold we re going to get fairness am i going to push really hard for this government to negotiate against every one of those health care companies yes am i going to push really hard to get passage we re only going to get passage look one of the reasons i was running is i don t believe this that we re going to get passage of any of these sweeping health care changes until we change the way this government s working mr steyer s health care plan which places him among the field s centrists favors the public option but envisions a role for the federal government in negotiating payment rates for providers and hospitals look if you think about the affordable care act there are four big special interests in health care right drug companies insurance companies private hospitals and doctors the affordable care act went four for four they were all on back of it it helped them all that was the way it was designed it was politically intelligent to get it done medicare for all zero for four public option zero for four maybe one for four actually but my point is to fight those people then we re going to have to take away their ability to control this really ji so what do you do in the short term i think in the short term what you do is you negotiate like hell look we have laws i mean obviously the people you guys are not average voters excuse me ji we have a president right now whose whole plan was predicated on negotiating like hell with drug companies no we have a president right now whose actual plan in health care has been to take away as much health care as possible from americans because he hates the affordable care act because it s called obamacare and actually he s refused to do the things to build on obamacare he s done everything he can actually to make it worse to make it more expensive and less effective so actually that s what the president s been doing and so with the affordable care act we could be doing a much better job if mr trump weren t trying to sabotage the affordable care act so there s a bunch of stuff that we could be doing to make it much more responsive to work on costs which we re not doing but to get the real changes that we re talking about and i happen to have been from the beginning a public option person that in order to get that we re going to actually have to have political change we can make the affordable care act a lot better but we can t get what i would think of as affordable health care is a right for every american until we get political change kk for the past several decades most of the change in government has actually come through the courts who is on your supreme court shortlist give us some names i don t have a supreme court shortlist do i think that there are do i know federal judges who i have a lot of respect for sure i do but have i gone through and drawn up a list of people for the bench no i haven t this is kind of honestly a little bit like asking who i d have as a vice presidential candidate ba can i go back one second to the last you presented yourself as the one candidate who is willing to stand up for the primacy of climate change as an issue and then she asked you to defend that and you didn t you said nope i want to do health care too why won t you stand up for the primacy of climate change in november mr steyer critiqued some of his democratic rivals in saying i m the only person on this stage who will say climate is the no 1 priority for me he continued vice president biden won t say it senator warren won t say it i will i will declare a state of emergency ba well do it right now how do you explain to a voter who thinks health care is their no 1 priority that climate change is actually the most important look if we don t get this right then it s going to overtake the lives of every single american jb what do you mean when you say you ll declare an emergency on day 1 what does that look like what do you do i think it basically there s some emergency powers to president what it really means is determining how we re going to generate power putting in rules about power generation putting in rules about transportation how many miles per gallon rule e v rules putting in rules about building efficiency putting in changing those are things we can do that the president can through can put in a whole bunch of rules in terms of how we generate and use power on day 1 what can t happen is the idea that we ll spend all the money that s necessary in order to get things done but we can put in rules and i m a big believer just so you know in actually putting in rules what we ve seen in california over the last 12 years is that putting in rules really works mr steyer s plan is unique in proposing the use of emergency powers to redirect government funding toward measures countering climate change mr trump was broadly criticized for declaring an emergency to appropriate funds for his border wall kk if you re not elected president and a democrat is would you consider taking the role of energy secretary one wikileaks email exchange from clinton associates mentioned mr steyer as a possible energy secretary i haven t even thought about it jw can i follow up on katie s question about the supreme court and michelle s question about vice presidency you ve demurred on these questions but i think it would be nice to return a little bit to political reality for a moment and look at how washington works and that there are three branches of government and that much as katie said of what has happened in american policy and politics in the last 40 years has happened through the courts you haven t really talked about congress although you did mention i think to mara that the senate is going to be an important part of the 2020 election how do you see i mean you ve talked about executive orders how do you see that working in the current political environment in washington i just don t understand even if you were able to do half of the things that you re talking about doing through executive order you re already seeing a supreme court that s becoming increasingly hostile to at least democratic presidents assertions of executive authority we re watching that right now in the daca case i don t quite see the leap that you re making from your talking a lot about what you would do as president but it seems sort of separated from how things actually work on the ground in washington how would you navigate those straits i think washington s going to change i mean i know you re going to sit there and think i m naïve but i think we have an election jw no i m just wondering how look i think have an election in 2020 that is going to change things in washington d c i think it s absolutely critical jw you think the senate is going to come the democrats are going to take back the senate you think i do thomas edsall a contributor to the times on demographic trends recently wrote that the senate is structurally resistant to democratic control because of national polarization for democrats to take back the senate they need to win 11 seats in competitive states while republicans need to win only five seats in competitive purple states jw you do yep look i think that you guys take a look i m not just you know dreaming here if you look at what happened i have a different opinion about how elections work in the united states than most people do or at least that what i would think of as establishment than people do jw what s your opinion i think that the argument that i had starting at the end of 2017 but going fully for more than a year was how are we actually going to win in 2018 and the answer was we re going to be moderates from the establishment we re going to have moderates and we re going to get the we re going to persuade the liberal republicans and the independents to vote for us and that s how we re going to win seats and that s how we re going to take back congress i never thought that i don t believe that s true i don t believe that s what happened and i said no the way that we re going to win back congress is we re going to have a completely different turnout model and in fact we re going to win because a whole bunch of people who haven t voted before are going to realize it s critical to vote and we re going to need to be organized to make sure that happens and if you actually look at what happened in 2018 the number of people who voted republican from 2014 went up but the number of people who voted democratic went from 35 to 59 million people it was up by 75 percent if you look at the number of people in the districts where we were organizing young people what the turnout went it went from 18 percent to 41 percent so when you asked me what happened in 2018 democrats showed up in a completely different level turnout in the 2018 midterms was the highest recorded since the census bureau started tracking midterm voter turnout in 1978 the turnout surge was especially salient for youth democratic leaning hispanics and asian americans and white college graduates if you look at what happened in 2019 if you look at virginia kentucky louisiana turnout the kentucky governor lost with more votes than he won with if you look at louisiana read the stories in the i believe it s called the new york times turnout this is a turnout election if the people of the united states which i strongly fervently believe they do understand what s at stake we have a sweeping victory mc all right i m one of the board members based out of washington so it s partially my job to be the skunk at the garden party so if you don t have democrats take back the senate you re facing a senate led by mitch mcconnell well known for not being particularly fond of bipartisanship or confirming democratic presidents justices how are you the best person to deal with him look if i remember correctly mitch mcconnell is the person who said when barack obama got elected my job is to make sure he doesn t get re elected in an interview with national journ
the installation of a minority socialist party podemos government in spain last week raises essential political issues facing workers across europe and internationally described by its architects as the most progressive government since spain s second republic 1931 1939 it is in fact committed to imposing austerity attacks on democratic rights and militarism it will take place in pre civil war like rhetoric from the right wing parties the popular party pp citizens and far right vox which are seeking to bring down prime minister pedro sánchez during the investiture debate they accused sánchez of being a traitor and sociopath for accepting support from the catalan and basque nationalist parties vox has called on the state to intervene to stop sánchez s investiture after spain saw four coups in the 20th century with the 1936 coup leading to a three year civil war and a 39 year fascist dictatorship under francisco franco the character of the new government however cannot be measured on the basis of the attacks of the right but by its political programme and the history of the parties making it up the deputy prime minister of economy will be nadia calviño known for her defence of neoliberal policies in the european union she will be tasked with implementing cuts and tax increases to satisfy the government s pledge to the eu of 8 billion in austerity measures this year podemos and the socialist party psoe have vowed to respect the mechanisms of budget discipline the psoe podemos government will be the first affected by the amendment of article 135 of the constitution to ensure budgetary stability passed by josé luis rodríguez zapatero s psoe government in 2011 with pp support this amendment makes the repayment of public debt a priority over social expenditure at all levels of government the law allowed nine years until it would go fully into effect the amendment now requires the psoe podemos government to cut 25 billion and reduce the national debt by half a billion euros according to the psoe podemos deal income tax for those earning over 130 000 a year will rise 2 percent 4 percent for those earning over 300 000 this means that the richest 0 5 percent of the population will pay 49 percent still below other countries like belgium 60 percent or france 55 percent even sánchez s right wing predecessor had a higher income tax on the richest bracket 52 percent between 2012 and 2014 capital gains tax will also rise by four percentage points for those with incomes above 140 000 and corporate tax will have a new minimum rate of 15 percent while banks and energy firms will have to pay 18 percent all of these are still lower than the european average workers will bear the brunt of new taxes through increases in taxes on diesel train tickets road tolls and self employed contributions to social security due to the growing precariousness many workers are false self employed as companies describe them as contractors while they do regular work the widely hoped for caps on rents in the housing market have been reduced to a promise to let local city authorities impose temporary rent ceilings if they discover undefined abusive rent increases in the last five years however rents have increased around 50 percent in cities like madrid and barcelona the coalition has also vowed to roll back some provisions of the 2012 pp labour reform though not that passed by the psoe in 2010 both measures helped slash wage levels by increasing the number of temporary and part time contracts promoting unpaid internships and apprenticeships facilitating redundancies and letting companies make unilateral wage cuts if they projected they would make a loss the latest statistics show the disastrous effects of these policies the average income of workers under 35 fell more than 23 percent from 35 600 in 2011 to 27 300 in 2017 over 90 percent of new contracts are part time or temporary ranging from days to weeks of approximately 17 million wage earners in spain nearly 6 million or 35 percent are precarious workers the new labour minister the stalinist yolanda díaz will not revoke most of these assaults on workers rather the government vows to modify more controversial parts of the labour reform like the authorisation to fire workers on sick leave or unilaterally change job contracts the government also claims it will raise the minimum wage from 1 050 to 60 percent of spain s average monthly salary 1 970 that is 1 182 by the end of 2024 this is an increase of less than 2 4 percent per year josé luis escrivá will run the ministry of social security inclusion and migration a former employee of the bank of spain european central bank independent authority for fiscal responsibility of spain and the bbva bank he will preside over the detention centres for migrants where they are held in prison like conditions the last psoe government brutally cracked down against migrants working closely with morocco to block migrant ships from reaching spain s coast escrivá will also be tasked with slashing the pension system to make it sustainable in recent years calls have grown inside the political establishment for deep cuts to public expenditure on pensions sociologist manuel castells podemos will be the minister of universities castells has openly defended the us university system where each university has independent structures and can attract private sector investments and where students pay tens of thousands of euros in yearly tuition arancha gonzález laya will preside over spanish imperialism s foreign policy the new government will also have to respond to a petition from washington to increase the us naval presence at the rota naval base in spain by 50 percent making it the largest us naval base in southern europe this is part of the global drive to war including the ongoing military build up against iran in the persian gulf on democratic rights the new government has claimed it will change the citizens security law the gag law which severely restricts the right to free assembly and protests however the previous psoe government did not change this and last year passed an internet censorship law the so called digital security law podemos abstained in the vote to allow the censorship law to pass it allows the state to shut down digital communications websites and apps at will without a court order the anti catalan campaign the main framework the ruling class has used to justify its right wing agenda will continue the new government has signalled it will not oppose the courts campaign against the catalan nationalists and will not free nine catalan politicians jailed in a fraudulent show trial overseen by the psoe last week barcelona s electoral commission vacated catalan regional premier quim torra s seat in the catalan parliament in effect removing him as regional premier it follows a decision by spain s supreme court supporting the central electoral commission s order suspending him as a member of parliament the same body ruled that incarcerated catalan leader oriol junqueras who received 1 7 million votes cannot leave custody to take his seat as a european parliament member the psoe podemos government made no comment podemos leader pablo iglesias said during last week s investiture debate the next government will need criticism and pressure from social movements to do things right this recalls how the greek ally of podemos syriza called strikes and protests against its own austerity policies while it was the ruling party however these did nothing to halt syriza s violent onslaught against workers and migrants in greece it is now widely acknowledged even in the bourgeois media that the psoe podemos government s right wing agenda paves the way for the fascistic vox party and its leader santiago abascal to take power estefania molina for el confidencial wrote that podemos is now part of the system and proof of this is that its leader no longer speaks of the regime of 78 or avoids talking about political prisoners well if podemos is part of the system the party that will reap benefits from citizens disaffection with politics hereafter will be vox abascal is watching the precarious working and middle classes those disenchanted with politics
china s president xi jinping and us president donald trump during a meeting outside the great hall of the people in beijing artyom ivanov tass getty images the united states china and the european union account for one half of the world economy with the magnitude and scope of their trade and financial flows those three large economic systems are fully capable of setting the pace of global business cycle dynamics especially if they effectively coordinate their demand management policies unfortunately the policy coordination issue is an old pious wish despite the fact that the g 20 had been set up precisely for that purpose so as always the u s will continue to be the pace setter of the global economy at the cost of its half a trillion dollar trade deficits serving as net contributions to jobs and incomes in the rest of the world the u s however is in no position to do that but that is the price it has to pay for its failure to organize an appropriate burden sharing of running the world economy with its main trade partners watch now with its huge budget and trade deficits its soaring public debt and alarming deterioration of external liabilities washington has no room for tax cuts or higher public spending all it s got figuratively speaking are the federal reserve s printing presses as long as the expected cost and price outlook allows the central bank to keep reasonably anchored inflation expectations luckily that s what the fed is looking at now the index measuring prices of consumption expenditures excluding food and energy has stabilized around an annual rate of 1 5 comfortably below its 2 target range unit labor costs the key indicator of underlying inflation are also stable during the first nine months of 2019 they came in at an annual rate of 1 9 roughly identical to readings observed over the previous two years the latest business surveys show the same picture of stabilizing or even weakening prices in recent months and those surveys don t indicate disruptions of global supply chains in the wake of widespread trade disputes bond markets seem to agree by reflecting stable inflation expectations the fed therefore has the option to respond with further easing in case of weakening demand and employment creation watch now china for its part could also help to support the world economy because it is reducing its reliance on exports and generating most of its economic growth from household consumption and investments beijing s trade balance turned negative last year while its large tax cuts reportedly amounting to 2 of gdp contributed nearly 1 percentage point of economic growth those tax cuts are part of fiscal reforms scheduled to continue this year too at the same time china s monetary authorities announced an appropriately easy credit stance to support aggregate demand a transition to sustainable long term growth and structural reforms of the financial sector europe is a big disappointment the euro area the core component of the european union is failing to implement an expansionary monetary fiscal policy mix that would prop up its sluggish economy and contribute to global demand and employment and yet with the exception of greece and spain most euro area members could to a varying degree ease their fiscal stance germany with its overflowing government coffers and the world s largest trade surplus should lead that process but its governing coalition is in disarray and struggling with large public sector investment backlogs in transportation education and healthcare watch now

on the other hand banking oil gas exploration and textile composite sectors helped the index finish in the green zone meanwhile international credit rating agency fitch ratings has affirmed pakistan s long term foreign currency issuer default rating idr at b with a stable outlook fitch stated that pakistan s b rating reflects a challenging external position characterised by a high external financing requirement and low reserves weak public finances including large fiscal deficits and a high government debt to gdp ratio and weak governance indicators fitch highlighted that external vulnerabilities have been reduced over the past year as a result of policy actions by the authorities and financing unlocked through an international monetary fund imf programme which helped reduce the current account deficit and supported a modest rebuilding of reserves the agency forecast a further narrowing of the current account deficit to 2 1pc of gross domestic product gdp in the year ending june 2020 fy20 and 1 9pc in fy21 from 4 9pc in the last fiscal year the report said import compression remains the predominant driver of the narrowing deficit facilitated by a depreciation of the rupee against the us dollar of around 30pc since december 2017 and tighter monetary conditions exports are forecast to grow modestly from a low base the report indicated tighter macroeconomic policies are further slowing gdp growth which fitch forecasts at 2 8pc in fy20 from 3 3pc in fy19 it said we expect growth to recover gradually to 3 4pc by fy21 inflation has also continued to rise sharply from the cost pass through of the currency depreciation and increases in energy tariffs fitch forecasts inflation to average 11 3pc in fy20 compared with 6 8pc in fy19 the sbp is likely to keep the policy rate at the current peak of 13 25pc in the coming months before modest cuts towards the end of fy20 as inflationary pressures would begin to fade in asia stock markets edge higher as

the issue of health care ought to provide democrats a smooth limousine ride to the white house polling shows that health care is tied for first along with the economy as the leading political issue for americans and among voters in the upper midwest swing states likely to decide the election donald trump gets worse marks for his handling of health care than for any other issue yet in recent months health care has been more like a demolition derby a spectacle in which democratic candidates bash each other over policy differences in ways that weaken the whole field this past fall elizabeth warren saw her lead in iowa and new hampshire polls collapse after she struggled to explain how she would pay for her single payer medicare for all plan without raising taxes on the middle class she has also lost support among likely democratic primary voters who have become increasingly concerned about polls showing that single payer would be a political loser in the general election because in addition to higher taxes it would require 157 million americans to give up the employer provided health coverage they currently rely on similarly kamala harris dropped out of the race in december in part because of her embrace and then rejection of medicare for all joe biden and pete buttigieg have done somewhat better by eschewing single payer in favor a public option essentially building on obamacare by letting the uninsured and others buy into medicare or some other government run health insurance program with subsidies for those who need them but these more moderate candidates have not been able to close the deal with the many left leaning democratic voters who think america s flawed health care system needs more fundamental change and those voters have a point america needs change beyond what any extension of obamacare can offer because obamacare can t solve health care s most pressing and electorally salient issue rising costs for the typical medium income family of four with health insurance annual health care costs have risen by more than 10 000 in the decade since the passage of the affordable care act since 2008 deductibles for covered workers have increased eight times as fast as wages the rising cost of premiums nominally paid by employers is a major reason why so many of us haven t gotten a raise in decades money that might go to increased wages goes instead to cover the cost of unrelenting health care inflation champions of medicare for all claim that their plan would attack this crisis by giving the government bargaining power to demand lower prices from doctors hospitals and drug companies but even if that s true in theory it doesn t change the fact that medicare for all is electorally toxic its abstract promise of cost control doesn t overcome voters aversion to higher taxes or losing their insurance warren and sanders s plans most likely outcome isn t cheaper care it s four more years of donald trump this past fall elizabeth warren saw her lead in iowa and new hampshire polls collapse after she struggled to explain how she would pay for her single payer medicare for all plan without raising taxes on the middle class biden s and buttigieg s plans are far more politically salable and they claim that the public option as it grows could also be used by the government to extract lower prices that s also true for those who choose the public option but for those who stick with their private insurance that is most people in the short and medium term health care costs will likely skyrocket as hospitals and doctor groups raise prices on employer provided plans to make up the loss of revenue from the public option in other words democrats might be able to win with the public option in 2020 only to get crushed in 2022 or 2024 as millions of angry voters who were promised health care cost savings wind up experiencing the opposite democrats desperately need an alternative health care plan one that has broad political appeal and won t cost the democrats the next election yet also gives progressives the structural changes they want most important of all they need a plan for solving the health care cost problem that an overwhelming number of voters say they want addressed fortunately there is such a plan with coauthor paul hewitt formerly deputy commissioner for policy at the social security administration and a health economist i first sketched it out in these pages nearly two years ago see the case for single price health care april may june 2018 the core idea is straightforward have the federal government mandate that the prices medicare pays for health care apply to everyone s health care plan call it medicare prices for all if implemented today it would in one stroke dramatically restructure health care markets while dramatically cutting medical costs for most working families and all without asking a single voter to change providers or health plans or to pay another dollar in taxes in fact if done right most americans with employer provided health care plans would see fatter paychecks better yet if combined with a few other features it would dramatically reduce administrative costs eliminate extra charges for out of network care and other forms of price discrimination and put more control over clinical decisions in the hands of doctors we know those sound like big promises it s legitimate to ask hard questions like how politically feasible such a plan might be or whether the promised cost savings would actually materialize as it happens state employees in montana have implemented a version of medicare prices for all for themselves since our story was published the results of that experiment are in they offer any democrat who cares to listen the way out of the party s increasingly acute health care dilemma in the fall of 2014 montana s 30 000 state employees and their families faced a deep threat their health care plan was going broke with losses on course to reach 50 million in just a few years if this story had played out the way it has for just about everyone else in america with group health insurance the plan s members would have faced years of fast rising premiums higher deductibles and an ever shrinking choice of in network doctors but that s not the way this story ended mostly that s because of marilyn bartlett an accountant by training she had spent the previous 13 years working in the health insurance industry rising to be the chief financial officer of a company that administered benefits on behalf of group health care plans but as she neared retirement age she decided to redirect her inside knowledge of the industry by switching sides she embarked on an encore career as head of the floundering montana benefit plan which provides health insurance for montana state employees retirees legislators and their children spouses and survivors bartlett was immediately struck by the crazy prices she saw coming across her desk some hospitals in montana were charging five times what medicare pays for performing specific medical services while others charged merely double one hospital for example would charge 25 000 for a knee replacement and another would charge 115 000 sometimes a hospital might offer the plan at say a 7 percent discount on the price of performing a knee operation but it was a 7 percent discount off a list price plucked out of the air bartlett pressed cigna the plan s administrator at the time she took over to find out what the hospitals real costs were but cigna like other insurance companies and third party administrators she approached refused to take on the task so bartlett went to the hospitals themselves demanding to see some cost accounting but here too she hit a brick wall one hospital told her it didn t know what its real costs were the others just refused to share any accounting that might justify their prices effectively saying to bartlett and her plan s members these are our prices take it or leave it under normal circumstances people in bartlett s position just go along with such ultimatums as hospitals merge with one another and increasingly combine with doctors practices health care markets in most of america are becoming highly collusive and monopolized in 90 percent of metro areas according to measures used by the federal trade commission and department of justice in evaluating antitrust cases hospital markets are highly concentrated typically dominated by large corporate chains that have bought out smaller community hospitals and in many instances shut them down this means that when health care plans go to negotiate with these giants over what prices the hospitals will charge them and through premiums and copayments charge their members they usually wind up being price takers not price makers hospitals that dominate their local market know that any health care plan doing business in the area must include them in their networks or their members will revolt and so like the soup nazi character on seinfeld such hospitals can just say no soup for you to any plan that dares to try negotiating for better terms this means that for all intents and purposes the prices paid by different health care plans are not determined by open markets balancing supply and demand but rather by sheer monopolistic power in the face of such circumstances insurance companies are busy merging with one another to increase their own monopoly power some are buying hospitals themselves in both cases plan administrators often just wind up colluding with hospitals and passing the pain down the line ultimately in the form of increased out of pocket costs and a reduced choice of doctors for their customers who barely have a clue what s going on but what if bartlett wondered she could flip all that her plan was as audacious as it was simple going forward she told the state s hospitals the plan would pay all of them at the same rate and that rate would be fixed at roughly two times what medicare pays for a procedure and don t even think about sending a surprise bill to individual patients to make up the difference bartlett added take the deal or leave it democrats desperately need an alternative health care plan one that has broad political appeal yet also gives progressives the structural changes they want the hospitals went into battle mode heavily lobbying the governor and the legislature to shut her down but bartlett was in a unique position to withstand the pressure as she told propublica s marshall allen i m 67 so i could give a shit what are they going to do fire me i m packin a medicare card at first the unions representing state employees objected fearing that they would wind up losing access to local hospitals that didn t take the deal but bartlett helped to re channel the unions anger by pointing out that it was the hospitals that were threatening their health care by demanding monopolistic prices and fat financial margins if hospitals couldn t get by on two times what medicare determined was a fair and adequate price she pointed out they might need to cut out some waste state workers and their unions saw her point and began a letter writing and public relations campaign to pressure hospitals that refused the deal faced with this and the potential loss of some 30 000 fully insured patients all of montana s hospitals eventually buckled soon bartlett deployed the same tactics to push down the plan s prescription drug bill and within two years the plan went from projecting a 9 million deficit to a more than 100 million surplus and despite their protests montana s hospitals have managed to get by just fine across the country rural hospitals are shutting down but as of july last year none in montana have closed since bartlett s plan took effect because of bartlett s work state employees and their families have lower health care costs but other montana residents continue to pay some of the highest prices in the country this means that to lower costs for everyone the government needs to do what bartlett did for all americans rather than just those who get their insurance through a state run public plan that may seem like a tall task but it doesn t require medicare for all and therefore isn t insurmountable consider the politics while bartlett faced stiff opposition from hospitals the political forces arrayed against her were not nearly as broad and powerful as those that would have been summoned had she tried to implement anything like a single payer medicare for all type plan deep blue vermont home of bernie sanders tried that in 2011 but couldn t get it done due primarily to the daunting political challenge of raising the necessary taxes and broad public resistance to trusting the state government with a monopoly on health insurance montana s approach offers far fewer obstacles if done on a national scale it would mean that people who favor the status quo in private health insurance or who are opposed to new taxes are not enemies indeed they could join with reformers and demand more reasonable prices for everyone medicare prices for all has another advantage over medicare for all it is relatively simple to enact congress would just pass a law pegging all health care prices to some low multiple of what medicare pays there s no need to eliminate private insurance to gain purchasing power over providers and hospitals could no longer engage in price discrimination charging different plans and their members different prices for the same medical services it wouldn t matter whether people lived in a cornered or competitive health care market whether they were covered by a large or small health care plan or whether their doctor or nearest hospital was a preferred provider or out of network because all providers would get the same prices for the same treatments just as they do under medicare that means no more surprise bills the benefits to the more than 100 million americans who get their coverage through group insurance plans would be dramatic let s do a little back of the envelope calculation according to paul hewitt from 2010 to 2019 medicare spending per enrollee rose by 18 5 percent in line with the consumer price index meanwhile private sector plans saw their costs rise by 57 percent one result is a ballooning payment gap this year medicare only has to pay about 60 percent as much as private plans do for any given treatment the core idea is straightforward have the federal government mandate that the prices medicare pays for health care apply to everyone s health care plan call it medicare prices for all but what if we all got that medicare discount medical costs for working families could easily fall by one third or more for those with an employer sponsored health care plan this could produce a fatter paycheck according to hewitt a typical middle class head of household whose compensations this year included 14 561 in employer contributions to his or her company s health care plan and who paid 6 015 in employee contributions could expect a 6 800 to 8 200 increase in wages provided that we required employers to share the savings as could be done through changes in the laws governing private health care plans pursuing such a reform would of course lead to a vicious blowback from the medical industrial complex as in montana hospitals especially those charging the highest prices in the most cornered markets would bring out their big guns they d blast television and social media with ads threatening massive hospital closures in many areas of the country such as metro pittsburgh or cleveland where large integrated health care systems are among the biggest local employers and sources of campaign contributions they could certainly count on the support of many state and local officials who not infrequently sit on their boards when north carolina s state employee health care plan tried to implement a plan similar to bartlett s hospitals proved strong enough to beat back the effort at least for now but as the montana example suggests the politics of medicare prices for all while tough are not impossible the biggest challenge is overcoming the hospitals fearmongering about what will happen if they are forced to live on prices pegged to medicare but the idea that hospitals will go broke or even have to cut back on clinically beneficial spending is easily rebutted there are community hospitals that treat mostly medicare and medicaid patients they learn how to cover their costs by avoiding waste and inefficiency meanwhile hospitals with a greater mix of commercially insured customers are typically flush though many of these hospitals have managed to remain classified as nonprofits for tax purposes their excess revenues can often be literally seen in the lavish new buildings and parking lots filled with the luxury cars of overcompensated ceos specialists and administrative staff the head of the nonprofit university of pittsburgh medical center earned 8 54 million last year and 33 other executives each collected more than a million data from the afl cio shows that two of the largest for profit health care systems in america hca healthcare and tenet have ceos earning more relative to their rank and file workers than the heads of bank of america morgan stanley and exxon mobil even with all of this bloat at the top hospitals collectively are earning an 8 percent margin which as the health economist emily gee of the center for american progress points out is higher than the margins in the pharmacy or insurance industries the hospital sector as a whole is so wasteful overpriced and bloated with growing legions of administrative workers that it is one of the few areas of american life where standard measures of labor productivity have been declining for decades even as hospitals deploy more and more expensive and clinically dubious technologies like proton beam radiation machines americans may fret about spending less on health care providers we trust hospitals and clinics with our lives and it s understandable to worry that cutting back their revenue would lead to worse treatment but study after study shows that america s excess spending on health care does not improve outcomes if anything the opposite is true the united states spends more on health care each year than every other country in the developed world but boasts one of its lowest life expectancies indeed america s life expectancy has been falling since 2014 even as health care spending has gone up one of the leading causes of this decline opioid overdoses is a direct product of uncontrolled and unchecked profit motives in the medical industry doctors themselves believe according to a study published in 2017 that more than a fifth of all medical care is unnecessary they are right over medication not just of opioids and unnecessary surgeries are leading causes of death in the united states meanwhile the prices americans have to pay for drugs and medical services are multiples of what people in other nations pay for equally good if not better health care the idea that the u s health care system will collapse if it has to live on the same share of gdp as say germany or france is ludicrous so just how would a medicare prices for all plan work the first order of business of course is setting medicare prices currently the medicare payment advisory commission medpac a congressional agency computes what relatively efficient health providers would need to be paid in order to turn a slim profit on their various health services then medicare establishes a base payment rate for different units of service such as a hospital stay or an operation medicare makes adjustments for particular hospitals and other providers based on variables such as their geographic location and the complexity of the conditions they treat this process is not without flaws or challenges over the years medicare has tended to overcompensate specialists and undercompensate primary care doctors and other caregivers a bias that is replicated in private insurance plans moreover providers treating patients covered under traditional medicare have the ability to make up for any restraints on their prices by just increasing the volume of their services such as by performing unnecessary tests and procedures medicare is attacking this problem by experimenting with new payment systems tied to patient outcomes that are mandated under the affordable care act going forward we could further improve pricing by implementing what policy wonks call all payer global budgeting under this plan all insurers public and private pay the same prices but in addition all hospitals are held to a fixed global budget as determined by an independent agency that calculates how much each hospital needs to cover its costs if it runs efficiently the total amount of revenue the hospital gets to keep stays the same regardless of how many patients it admits or what medical services it performs as a result there are no incentives for engaging in unnecessary treatments instead there are incentives to invest in prevention and effective disease management because keeping patients healthy reduces a hospital s costs but not its revenues state employees in montana now receive a version of medicare prices for all the results of that experiment are in they offer any democrat who cares to listen the way out of the party s increasingly acute health care dilemma maryland has been experimenting with this approach and so far the results look promising when a rational nondiscriminatory pricing system is combined with global budgeting insurance companies no longer even pay for individual procedures or treatments instead they pay a flat annual rate for the coverage of whole populations that leaves it up to hospitals rather than insurance company bureaucrats to figure out how to most effectively deploy health care resources in the care of individual patients and local communities notice too that moving to such a system should help all health care plans public and private as well as health care providers cut back substantially on overhead costs just as medicare for all plans promise to do global budgeting eliminates billing and once price discrimination is eliminated all sides won t need so many high cost executives engaged in secret dealings over who gets to charge what and to whom for this or that procedure nor will they need so many executives and consultants involved in mergers and acquisitions designed to increase their bargaining power in price negotiations under an all payer single price system the incentives that have driven wave after wave of consolidation among both providers and insurers largely disappear we will still need more aggressive antitrust action in many markets but just eliminating price discrimination and fixing global budgets would go a long way toward restoring and properly structuring productive competition instead of competing over who can grow the biggest fastest and gain the most leverage in pricing and cost shifting both purchasers and providers of health care can focus on other ways of winning like who can provide the best customer service and just maybe the highest quality most cost

democratic forces sdf allies of the global coalition against the islamic state since invading northern syria on october 9 turkish forces and their islamist mercenaries have killed up to seven hundred sdf members and displaced three hundred thousand people german chancellor angela merkel chastised turkey s president recep erdogan citing humanitarian issues and the resurgence of isis france norway finland and the netherlands joined germany in suspending military equipment sales to turkey the turkish and german economies are closely connected germany is a major market for turkish goods turkey s economy would suffer serious consequences if vw s action has a knock off effect discouraging other businesses to invest the vw decision comes at an uncertain moment for turkey s economy macroeconomic stability is wobbly and turkish banks have high foreign indebtedness levels the turkish lira was trading at 1 5 to the u s dollar when erdogan s justice and development party akp came to power in 2003 today s exchange rate is 5 5 lira to the dollar while a weaker lira boosts exports it has a dramatic impact on the cost of supplies needed for manufacturing turkey s manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on imported inputs which are now much more expensive the lira crashed again in august 2018 increasing inflation by more than 25 percent which makes debt servicing more expensive despite reduced interest rates bank lending remained weak throughout the first three quarters of 2019 elevated inflation and lira uncertainty are curtailing the purchasing power of consumers and hurting retail activity which contracted significantly from september 2018 to august 2019 turkey s treasury and finance minister berat albayrak tried to rein in fiscal policy but reducing interest rates is a short term fix that merely masks endemic structural problems concerns about the banking sector were exacerbated when the southern district of new york convicted the state owned halkbank of money laundering in a scheme to circumvent us sanctions on iran the u s prosecutor called halkbank a fugitive when it failed to appear in court in the criminal case last month sanctions will prevent other banks from doing business with halkbank and could lead to a run on hard currency foreign direct investment fdi has the potential to staunch financial hemorrhaging but fdi requires investor confidence erdogan blames jewish bankers for turkey s currency and credit crisis turkey s disdain for the rule of law not only discourages fdi it also contributes to conflict and injustice in society the dismal state of democracy in turkey is marked by rigged elections and the arbitrary arrest of oppositionists kurdish political leaders have been prosecuted on bogus terrorism charges article 140 of the penal code which makes it a crime to denigrate turkishness is used to suppress dissent and silence critics the results of recent local elections in kurdish majority regions were suspended and local mayors were replaced by government appointed trustees erdogan turned turkey into a giant gulag after the so called coup in 2016 about fifty thousand people face politically motivated charges and more than one hundred thousand civil servants were dismissed turkey has imprisoned more journalists than any other country turkey is turning to international financial institutions to remedy its woes however turkey s invasion and atrocities in northern syria have alienated the international community in response to turkey s criminal conduct in syria the house of representatives recently passed a sanctions bill overwhelmingly by 403 to 16 turkey may also be subject to additional sanctions through the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa which should kick in after turkey activates the s 400 missiles it bought from russia for 3 billion turkey is facing a perfect storm brought on by its ineffective governance social discontent and regional conflict investors should be wary the political risk is too high and returns too modest if current trends continue then banks and businesses will be running for the exits vw s withdrawal is a warning about the risk of doing

by gary stringer kim escue and chad keller stringer asset management while election years may result in market volatility any election outcome is unlikely to have a significant economic impact over time markets will reflect economic fundamentals such as productivity growth labor force growth and inflation each of these fundamentals have little to do with the executive branch similarly geopolitical risks of the scale we are likely to see in the coming weeks and months should have little impact on the u s economy rather despite broader implications these types of events tend to spur temporary equity market declines which are often quickly reversed content continues below advertisement in aggregate our economic signals suggest a stable slow growing economy ahead though we see positive signs in many broad measures such as liquidity growth improvements as well as increases in housing construction and residential investment we cannot forget that the yield curve inverted last year which is a cautionary signal overall our base case scenario is constructive and built on solid u s economic fundamentals global economic growth rates appear to be stabilizing at historically low levels after slowing since 2018 our collection of more near term signals such as leading economic indicators leis continue to suggest slow and steady economic growth overall we expect 2 real u s gdp growth over the near term foreign economies such as the euro zone and japan look less robust with growth barely positive domestically the yield curve is one of the indicators that we track to gauge the probability for future recessions when short term interest rates are higher than long term interest rates as they were from may through september the curve is forecasting an economic contraction 3 18 months ahead though we have seen some recent improvement we are not out of the woods yet similarly automobile production and residential investment are economically sensitive though they account for a small part of our economy these two measures have proven to be good indicators of future broad economic activity currently these indicators are mixed overall however these long lead time indicators may be up to two years early and a lot can happen in that time our near term indicators continue to suggest slow and steady economic growth ahead we are pleased that the u s federal reserve fed changed course during the second half of 2019 by reducing short term interest rates and are again expanding the size of their balance sheet the slow growth global economy demands lower interest rates than we had at the start of 2019 at the same time the high global demand for u s currency leads to further balance sheet expansion we think that u s monetary policy is well positioned to support further economic growth as we can see with the increased pace of liquidity growth as measured by m1 the u s jobs market contains important near term indicators as well for example weekly jobless claims layoffs tend to spike 15 20 in the months preceding a recession currently the year over year change is near 0 which suggests slow growth but not a recession the number of layoffs can only get so low and the current rate of change makes sense late in a business cycle further confirmation of slow and steady growth comes from monthly jobs creation as the amount of change in the headline unemployment rate can be telling the headline unemployment rate tends to increase marginally from year ago levels on the cusp of recession the current change is near 0 we prefer to track jobs creation on a rolling basis rather than monthly due to the volatility of the monthly numbers an average monthly jobs creation rate near 100k new jobs per month or better signals a healthy labor market business surveys such as purchasing manager indices pmi also offer important information an increase in pmis suggests increasing economic growth while a decline suggests economic slowing additionally pmis often drop close to 45 prior to a recession currently pmis are stabilizing for each major economy and region that we track inflation is another important factor to consider as some inflation is good for corporate revenue growth treasury inflation protected securities tips spreads and industrial metals prices provide useful insights for inflation trends and tend to move together both measures have recovered from their lows but are still far below their 2018 highs when u s economic growth was accelerating these market based inflation measures suggest the fed is not likely to hit their 2 target investment implications meanwhile consensus estimates for 2020 earnings growth are significantly higher than our expectations while we expect earnings to grow in 2020 and stock prices to move broadly higher we are not as enthusiastic as some according to factset 2020 earnings for s p 500 index companies are expected to be up 9 6 over 2019 which is higher than the 10 year average of 9 1 the combination of slow economic growth and higher labor costs pegs our 2020 earnings growth expectation at 5 similarly equity valuations based on an earnings yield of 5 plus a dividend yield of nearly 2 results in a 7 equity market total return expectation meanwhile the current sec yield of approximately 2 5 seems like a reasonable expectation for high quality taxable domestic bond returns going forward though equity valuations in some foreign countries look attractive their lack of economic growth keeps our foreign equity allocations defensively minded using consumer staples health care and infrastructure for our investment themes we were more bullish last year than many based on the relatively low equity valuations for 2020 we are less bullish in our 2019 outlook we showed how valuations were compelling for forward returns however our current expectations for forward returns are more tempered we think that the markets have now priced in a lot of good news so disappointments can bring significant volatility our work suggests than any recession we might see in the coming years is likely to be shallow and short lived largely due to tighter regulations and a lack of bank industry leverage overall our risk first approach and conservative outlook keep us focused on consistent corporate earnings and dividends high quality the cash indicator our proprietary cash indicator ci continues to suggest that markets are functioning normally after rising from low levels last year the ci is now only slightly below its historical median value this suggests that the markets have priced in a moderate level of risk while valuations appear stretched we anticipate near term volatility but not a crisis this article was written by gary stringer cio kim escue senior portfolio

the ohio valley s economy could see slower growth in 2020 amid continued anxiety about trade and possible downturns in both energy and manufacturing according to analyses and forecasts by regional economists michael hicks directs the center for business and economic research at ball state university in indiana where heforecasts the health of the manufacturing sector hicks expects manufacturing to slow down and he blames the tariffs levied under president donald trump s administration hicks said the costs imposed by the trade war are playing out in markets across the region and he predicts the ohio valley s economic growth to slow dramatically in 2020 you will see layoffs certainly lower hours less generous bonuses both this year and next year less demand for power which is going to be important particularly in kentucky and west virginia as manufacturing firms both use less metallurgical coal and less coal for electrical power hicks said one tweet away a report hicks co authored shows the impact of manufacturing employment on the overall health of the united states economy has diminished production is still a large share of the economy but he said the economies of kentucky ohio and west virginia are heavily dependent on exports which is why the trade war has and will continue to have a large impact credit alexandra kanik i ohio valley resource the trump administration has made some recent moves to improve trade relations the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca would replace the north american free trade agreement or nafta usmca has passed the house and is still pending in the senate but hicks said that trade deal doesn t offer much assurance the usmca passage is essentially for your typical manufacturing firm it improves the confidence that we re not going to have a trade war with our big partners in canada and mexico hicks said but to just speak candidly we re always one tweet away from a new adversary in the trade war he said if european firms are less interested in buying higher priced american products it s enough to cause a significant decline in the demand for goods produced in the u s hicks said that could have a bigger effect in the region than in the country as a whole which is enough to push kentucky and west virginia ohio indiana illinois into a localized recession he said it s not enough for a national recession but it s enough to give us the feel and taste of what a recession would be like of the three states ohio s larger economy is also more diverse and follows national trends more closely zach schiller is an economist withpolicy matters ohio an economic research institute ohio is not an island you know our economy is closely integrated into the national and international economies schiller said schiller said the largest employers in ohio are either national or international companies and he expects any change in the state s economy to be similar to what happens nationally still recovering in kentucky manufacturing plays a significant role in the state s economy jason bailey director the left leaningkentucky center for economic policy he said manufacturing has grown in large part because of the auto industry but carmakers are seeing a slowdown we ve lost a lot of manufacturing over the last couple decades across the state and industries like apparel or furniture manufacturing or computer parts manufacturing that has often been to cheaper locations like china and in latin america bailey said bailey said kentucky still hasn t fully recovered from the last recession and it s facing a tough year ahead with state budget cuts likely west virginia is in a similar position with even fewer signs of economic recovery west virginia university s college of business and economics is predicting the economywill expand by about point two percent annually for the next five years the executive director of the left leaning west virginia center on budget and policy ted boettner said that s the lowest growth rate wvu has predicted for the state in the past seven years you know since our last economic recession that began in 2007 west virginia has seen less than a 1 percent increase in job growth over that time boettner said boettner said the state s economy has always been on a roller coaster ride based on energy markets the downturn in coal has hit hard of course but that was somewhat offset recently by a boost from natural gas and pipeline construction work now however one major pipeline project is complete and some others have been halted by legal challenges boettner said that focus on natural resource extraction can hamper other kinds of growth a lot of other industries especially ones based in the knowledge based economy don t really want to be around extractive industries boettner said they don t want to be around a lot of pollution and things like that so you really are choosing one over the other in some sense credit larry dowling west virginia public broadcasting pipeline stacked in morgantown wv boettner said the state has never had big urban centers to build a diversified economy around but he thinks investment in education could help with that i mean unfortunately it s gotten to the point where i think the only way that west virginia is going to really thrive potentially thrive over the coming decades will be unless there s massive federal investment in the state he said deficits despite growth the u s is in the longest period of economic recovery in modern history hicks said normally that would mean the country would be running a budget surplus and could start paying off debt or taking on big projects we would have made some long term investments in infrastructure highways roads particularly with transfers to local governments that are you know facing a lot of aging infrastructure hicks said instead hicks said the federal budget has a deficit of more than a trillion dollars after tax cuts and what he calls unsustainable federal spending including the trade bailouts for farmers and he said those economic policies are not having the degree of stimulus they should largely because of the negative effects of the trade war areport from ball state notes the trump administration s 2018 tax cuts and jobs act was meant to spur private non residential investment but whatever effect could have been expected was muted by a similarly large tax increase due to tariffs associated with the trade war we are running a budget deficit of 1 1 trillion which is considerably more than the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 hicks said that was obama s large stimulus package passed in february 2009 that was only 856 billion as economists across the region watch for signs of the next recession they also look to infrastructure investment as an area for potential growth the ohio valley has massive funding needs for its roads broadband internet access and aging water systems

global growth weakened considerably in 2019 as trade wars and weakening growth in china negatively impacted growth in many parts of the world the manufacturing sectors were either in recession or close to recession territory in response many central banks began to loosen monetary policy rather than tighten as had been expected a year ago with some countries notably china and the united states providing additional stimulus as well however the past month has seen some relief in the unrelentingly downbeat news on the global economy an uneasy cessation of trade hostilities between china and the united states the diminished risk of a no deal brexit and an ease in financial conditions as stimulus provided by central banks is beginning to filter through meanwhile as global exporters adjusted to the new world of higher tariffs the impacts of the trade war on real gdp growth turned out to be smaller than expected by the end of the year many of the ihs markit purchasing managers indexes especially in manufacturing began to stabilize and show small gains moreover while any major progress on the trade war will likely have to wait until after the 2020 us elections an escalation in hostilities significant enough to do major damage also seems unlikely the bright spot in the global economy continues to be consumer spending which is benefitting from decent income growth along with low oil prices inflation and interest rates in addition global financial conditions have improved across the world although rising debt levels pose a future threat all told ihs markit expects global growth to stabilize at 2 5 in 2020 before edging up in 2021 and 2022 the us economy will grow at trend around 2 we assess the trend or potential growth in the us economy to be around 2 real gdp growth was above trend from 2017 to 2019 thanks to fiscal stimulus however with the effects of this stimulus wearing off growth is returning to trend some special factors will boost gdp growth over the first half of next year the phase one trade deal with china will also help a little consumer spending roughly 70 of the economy will increase about 2 7 in 2020 putting a floor on growth in the broader economy on a calendar year basis we look for real gdp to expand 2 1 next year china s growth rate will fall below 6 while it is tempting to blame much of the recent slowdown on the us china trade war the decade long deceleration is the result of both structural and cyclical factors an ageing population and a sharp drop off in productivity growth mean that potential growth in china is lower now than a decade ago and is set to fall further since the global financial crisis 10 years ago china s debt as a percentage of gdp has surged to about 260 mostly due to a corporate borrowing binge and more recently an increase in household mortgage borrowing tying the hands of policymakers attempts to deleverage the economy by curbing the role of shadow banks have only been partially successful and have come at the expense of growth policymakers are currently engaged in a balancing act they would like to cut the debt ratio or at least keep it from rising while providing enough stimulus to keep growth from falling too fast ihs markit predicts that china s growth rate will slide even further to 5 7 in 2020 europe s economy will stabilize then recover slightly the slump in eurozone growth in 2019 was alarming nevertheless there are some signs that the worst may be over while the hard data are giving mixed signals weakness in the business sectors versus sustained growth in consumer spending the soft data are showing early signs of an inflection point in particular the ihs markit manufacturing pmis for the eurozone have picked up a little although service sector pmis have weakened ihs markit expects eurozone growth to stabilize at around 0 9 in 2020 before picking up a little in 2021 meanwhile the results of the uk election suggest that while the worst of the brexit uncertainty may be over there is still a hard slog ahead with growth dropping to 0 5 in 2020 before recovering slightly in 2021 japan s faltering growth will be cushioned by more stimulus japan s real gdp growth rate accelerated to an estimated 1 1 in 2019 however fourth quarter growth is expected to turn negative as a result of the increased sales tax at the beginning of october in response to the weakness driven by the sales tax hike along with the drag from trade and super typhoon hagibis the abe government announced a larger than expected 120 billion 15 month fiscal package the first since 2016 and the largest since 2012 the money intended to upgrade infrastructure invest in new technologies and repair typhoon damage will neutralize much of the negative effects of the sales tax hike consequently after falling to 0 3 in 2020 japanese real gdp growth is projected to recover in 2021 emerging markets will continue to tread water as debt reaches new peaks the past decade has not been kind to the emerging world as growth has fallen from an average 7 3 in 2010 to 4 2 in 2019 while the long slide in china s growth rate has been a key factor emerging markets also faced two other stiff headwinds lackluster expansions in the developed world and falling commodity prices recoveries in the developed world are predicted to remain fragile in the next few years while commodity prices are expected to slide at least in the near term these along with the simmering trade war and the continued decline in china s rate of expansion mean that there is very little scope for growth in the emerging world to rise much if at all from current low rates more local concerns such as riots in latin america and faltering growth in india are also worrisome source world economic forum

trillion dollars after tax cuts and what he calls unsustainable federal spending including the trade bailouts for farmers and he said those economic policies are not having the degree of stimulus they should largely because of the negative effects of the trade war a report from ball state notes the trump administration s 2018 tax cuts and jobs act was meant to spur private non residential investment but whatever effect could have been expected was muted by a similarly large tax increase due to tariffs associated with the trade war we are running a budget deficit of 1 1 trillion which is considerably more than the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 hicks said that was obama s large stimulus package passed in february 2009 that was only 856 billion as economists across the region watch for signs of the next recession they also look to infrastructure investment as an area for potential growth the ohio valley has massive funding needs for its roads broadband internet access and aging water systems
helicopter money is no panacea in recent decades the fed has engaged in a series of policy interventions and market manipulations that have paradoxically left it more powerful even as those interventions left a trail of crashes collapses and calamities this contradiction between fed omnipotence and fed incompetence is coming to a head the economy has been trapped in a prolonged period of subtrend growth i ve referred to it in the past as the new depression and the fed has been powerless to lift the economy out of it you may think of depression as a continuous decline in gdp the standard definition of a recession is two or more consecutive quarters of declining gdp and rising unemployment since a depression is understood to be something worse then a recession investors think it must mean an extra long period of decline but that is not the definition of depression the best definition ever offered came from john maynard keynes in his 1936 classic the general theory of employment interest and money keynes said a depression is a chronic condition of subnormal activity for a considerable period without any marked tendency towards recovery or towards complete collapse keynes did not refer to declining gdp he talked about subnormal activity in other words it s entirely possible to have growth in a depression the problem is that the growth is below trend it is weak growth that does not do the job of providing enough jobs or staying ahead of the national debt that is exactly what the u s is experiencing today long term growth is about 3 from 1994 to 2000 the heart of the clinton boom growth in the u s economy averaged over 4 per year for a three year stretch from 1983 to 1985 during the heart of the reagan boom growth in the u s economy averaged over 5 5 per year these two periods were unusually strong but they show what the u s economy can do with the right policies by contrast growth in the u s from 2007 through today has averaged something like 2 per year that is the meaning of depression it is not negative growth but it is below trend growth and growth under trump has been no greater than it was under obama the bigger problem is there s no way out as i said one manipulation leads to another my greatest fear is that the u s is becoming like japan which has used every trick in the book to no avail in my 2014 book the death of money i wrote the united states is japan on a larger scale that was six years ago now japan started its lost decade in the 1990s now their lost decade has dragged into three lost decades the u s began its first lost decade in 2009 and is now entering its second lost decade with no real end in sight what i referred to in 2014 was that central bank policy in both countries has been completely ineffective at restoring long term trend growth or solving the steady accumulation of unsustainable debt in japan this problem began in the 1990s and in the u s the problem began in 2009 but it s the same problem with no clear solution now in 2020 central banks have been cutting rates again as the trade war and slowing global growth have policymakers considering the implications of a new recession without the firepower they need as things stand the next recession may be impossible to get out of and the odds of avoiding a recession are low the only way out is for the fed to guarantee inflation whatever it takes nothing else has worked so why not try a more active fiscal policy why not load the helicopters with cash and dump it out over main street first we need to understand what helicopter money is and what it isn t the image of the fed printing paper money and dumping it from helicopters to consumers waiting below who scoop it up and start spending is a popular but not very informative way to describe helicopter money in reality helicopter money is the coordination of fiscal policy and monetary policy in a way designed to provide stimulus to a weak economy and to fight deflation helicopter money starts with larger deficits caused by higher government spending this spending is considered to have a multiplier effect for each dollar of spending perhaps 1 50 of additional gdp is created since the recipients of the government spending turn around and spend that same money on additional goods and services the u s treasury finances these larger deficits by borrowing the money in the government bond market normally this added borrowing might raise interest rates the economic drag from higher rates could cancel out the stimulus of higher spending and render the entire program pointless this is where the fed steps in the fed can buy the additional debt from the treasury with freshly printed money the fed also promises to hold these newly purchased treasury bonds on its balance sheet until maturity by printing money to neutralize the impact of more borrowing the economy gets the benefit of higher spending without the headwinds of higher interest rates the result is mildly inflationary offsetting the feared deflation that would trigger helicopter money in the first place it s a neat theory but it s full of holes the first problem is there s not much of a multiplier at this stage of the u s expansion the current expansion is already the longest in u s history it s also been the weakest expansion in history but an expansion nonetheless the multiplier effect of government spending is strongest at the beginning of an expansion when the economy has more spare capacity in labor and capital at this point the actual multiplier is probably less than one for every dollar of government spending the economy might only get 0 90 of added gdp not the best use of borrowed money the second problem with helicopter money is there is no assurance that citizens will actually spend the money the government is pushing into the economy they are just as likely to pay down debt or save any additional income this is the classic liquidity trap this propensity to save rather than spend is a behavioral issue not easily affected by monetary or fiscal policy finally there is an invisible but real confidence boundary on the fed s balance sheet after printing 4 trillion in response to the last financial crisis how much more can the fed print without risking confidence in the dollar itself quantitative tightening brought the balance sheet back down to 3 8 trillion but now it s over 4 trillion again as the fed has added hundreds of billions to its balance sheet since september when it starting shoring up short term money markets it s basically been qe lite modern monetary theorists and neo keynesians say there is no limit on fed printing yet history says otherwise importantly with so much u s government debt in foreign hands a simple decision by foreign countries to become net sellers of u s treasuries is enough to cause interest rates to rise thus slowing economic growth and increasing u s deficits at the same time if such net selling accelerates it could lead to a debt deficit death spiral and a u s sovereign debt crisis of the type that hit greece and the eurozone periphery in recent years in short helicopter money could have far less potency and far greater unintended negative consequences than its supporters expect regards jim rickards for the daily reckoning
turkey is facing a perfect storm brought on by its ineffective governance social discontent and regional conflict investors should be wary human rights democracy and good neighborly relations create a

plant in turkey existing facilities where vw produces commercial vehicles for its man subsidiary may also be on the chopping block vw invoked corporate social responsibility to justify its decision to suspend the assembly plant vw was reacting to turkey s unprovoked cross border attack against the syrian democratic forces sdf allies of the global coalition against the islamic state since invading northern syria on october 9 turkish forces and their islamist mercenaries have killed up to seven hundred sdf members and displaced three hundred thousand people german chancellor angela merkel chastised turkey s president recep erdogan citing humanitarian issues and the resurgence of isis france norway finland and the netherlands joined germany in suspending military equipment sales to turkey the turkish and german economies are closely connected germany is a major market for turkish goods turkey s economy would suffer serious consequences if vw s action has a knock off effect discouraging other businesses to invest the vw decision comes at an uncertain moment for turkey s economy macroeconomic stability is wobbly and turkish banks have high foreign indebtedness levels the turkish lira was trading at 1 5 to the u s dollar when erdogan s justice and development party akp came to power in 2003 today s exchange rate is 5 5 lira to the dollar while a weaker lira boosts exports it has a dramatic impact on the cost of supplies needed for manufacturing turkey s manufacturing sector is heavily reliant on imported inputs which are now much more expensive the lira crashed again in august 2018 increasing inflation by more than 25 percent which makes debt servicing more expensive despite reduced interest rates bank lending remained weak throughout the first three quarters of 2019 elevated inflation and lira uncertainty are curtailing the purchasing power of consumers and hurting retail activity which contracted significantly from september 2018 to august 2019 turkey s treasury and finance minister berat albayrak tried to rein in fiscal policy but reducing interest rates is a short term fix that merely masks endemic structural problems concerns about the banking sector were exacerbated when the southern district of new york convicted the state owned halkbank of money laundering in a scheme to circumvent us sanctions on iran the u s prosecutor called halkbank a fugitive when it failed to appear in court in the criminal case last month sanctions will prevent other banks from doing business with halkbank and could lead to a run on hard currency foreign direct investment fdi has the potential to staunch financial hemorrhaging but fdi requires investor confidence erdogan blames jewish bankers for turkey s currency and credit crisis turkey s disdain for the rule of law not only discourages fdi it also contributes to conflict and injustice in society the dismal state of democracy in turkey is marked by rigged elections and the arbitrary arrest of oppositionists kurdish political leaders have been prosecuted on bogus terrorism charges article 140 of the penal code which makes it a crime to denigrate turkishness is used to suppress dissent and silence critics the results of recent local elections in kurdish majority regions were suspended and local mayors were replaced by government appointed trustees erdogan turned turkey into a giant gulag after the so called coup in 2016 about fifty thousand people face politically motivated charges and more than one hundred thousand civil servants were dismissed turkey has imprisoned

the u s dollar which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years looks set to do so again in 2020 according to the latest reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists while most of those who forecast spot fx rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year when asked about the overall trend few say the well established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade part of that stems from the recent flare up in tensions between the united states and iran with investors piling into safe haven assets such as the yen which hit a three month high on wednesday that has parallels with market behaviour during bouts of worry about the u s china trade war last year despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies it is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months about 60 of analysts in the jan 6 9 reuters poll who answered an additional question 32 of 57 said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year graphic reuters poll u s dollar dominance this time last year over 60 of forecasters said the dollar s rally had already stalled your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another and i think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak said john hardy head of fx strategy at saxo bank citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless we all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up however with u s economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out the dollar could lose some of its shine we re not telling investors to go out and buy euros what we re telling investors is that the u s is converging back to europe there are tentative signs across the data set that europe is stabilizing said jamie fahy global macro and asset allocation strategist at citi broadly speaking we re looking at the big picture theme of u s exceptionalism probably reversing in a sign of dollar fatigue setting in speculators have cut back their bets in favour of the greenback to the lowest in two months according to the latest data from the u s commodity futures trading commission but there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head on indeed when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the u s dollar this year there was a near split among the poll respondents twenty seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies while 22 opted for developed ones the 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch the euro which has the potential to dent the dollar s strength has fallen on hard times losing nearly 7 over the past couple of years however analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2 to trade around 1 13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4 higher at 1 15 it was last changing hands around 1 11 on thursday but much will depend on how euro zone economies perform if the u s has to cut rates because it s under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound said tim riddell macro strategist at westpac over two thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year the remaining ones chose safe haven buying and or political tensions that comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe haven bets like dollar and yen denominated assets broadly the more liquid and volatile japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3 by end 2020 the other popular safe haven bet the swiss franc was expected to rise by a touch less than 1 against the dollar in a year hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if china u s relations sour again but iranian u s tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market source reuters polling by tushar goenka and sumanto mondal editing by hugh lawson

the ohio valley s economy could see slower growth in 2020 amid continued anxiety about trade and possible downturns in both energy and manufacturing according to analyses and forecasts by regional economists michael hicks directs the center for business and economic research at ball state university in indiana where he forecasts the health of the manufacturing sector hicks expects manufacturing to slow down and he blames the tariffs levied under president donald trump s administration hicks said the costs imposed by the trade war are playing out in markets across the region and he predicts the ohio valley s economic growth to slow dramatically in 2020 you will see layoffs certainly lower hours less generous bonuses both this year and next year less demand for power which is going to be important particularly in kentucky and west virginia as manufacturing firms both use less metallurgical coal and less coal for electrical power hicks said one tweet away a report hicks co authored shows the impact of manufacturing employment on the overall health of the united states economy has diminished production is still a large share of the economy but he said the economies of kentucky ohio and west virginia are heavily dependent on exports which is why the trade war has and will continue to have a large impact the trump administration has made some recent moves to improve trade relations the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca would replace the north american free trade agreement or nafta usmca has passed the house and is still pending in the senate but hicks said that trade deal doesn t offer much assurance the usmca passage is essentially for your typical manufacturing firm it improves the confidence that we re not going to have a trade war with our big partners in canada and mexico hicks said but to just speak candidly we re always one tweet away from a new adversary in the trade war he said if european firms are less interested in buying higher priced american products it s enough to cause a significant decline in the demand for goods produced in the u s hicks said that could have a bigger effect in the region than in the country as a whole which is enough to push kentucky and west virginia ohio indiana illinois into a localized recession he said it s not enough for a national recession but it s enough to give us the feel and taste of what a recession would be like of the three states ohio s larger economy is also more diverse and follows national trends more closely zach schiller is an economist with policy matters ohio an economic research institute ohio is not an island you know our economy is closely integrated into the national and international economies schiller said schiller said the largest employers in ohio are either national or international companies and he expects any change in the state s economy to be similar to what happens nationally still recovering in kentucky manufacturing plays a significant role in the state s economy jason bailey director the left leaning kentucky center for economic policy he said manufacturing has grown in large part because of the auto industry but carmakers are seeing a slowdown we ve lost a lot of manufacturing over the last couple decades across the state and industries like apparel or furniture manufacturing or computer parts manufacturing that has often been to cheaper locations like china and in latin america bailey said bailey said kentucky still hasn t fully recovered from the last recession and it s facing a tough year ahead with state budget cuts likely west virginia is in a similar position with even fewer signs of economic recovery west virginia university s college of business and economics is predicting the economy will expand by about point two percent annually for the next five years the executive director of the left leaning west virginia center on budget and policy ted boettner said that s the lowest growth rate wvu has predicted for the state in the past seven years you know since our last economic recession that began in 2007 west virginia has seen less than a 1 percent increase in job growth over that time boettner said larry dowling west virginia public broadcasting pipeline stacked in morgantown wv boettner said the state s economy has always been on a roller coaster ride based on energy markets the downturn in coal has hit hard of course but that was somewhat offset recently by a boost from natural gas and pipeline construction work now however one major pipeline project is complete and some others have been halted by legal challenges boettner said that focus on natural resource extraction can hamper other kinds of growth a lot of other industries especially ones based in the knowledge based economy don t really want to be around extractive industries boettner said they don t want to be around a lot of pollution and things like that so you really are choosing one over the other in some sense boettner said the state has never had big urban centers to build a diversified economy around but he thinks investment in education could help with that i mean unfortunately it s gotten to the point where i think the only way that west virginia is going to really thrive potentially thrive over the coming decades will be unless there s massive federal investment in the state he said deficits despite growth the u s is in the longest period of economic recovery in modern history hicks said normally that would mean the country would be running a budget surplus and could start paying off debt or taking on big projects we would have made some long term investments in infrastructure highways roads particularly with transfers to local governments that are you know facing a lot of aging infrastructure hicks said instead hicks said the federal budget has a deficit of more than a trillion dollars after tax cuts and what he calls unsustainable federal spending including the trade bailouts for farmers and he said those economic policies are not having the degree of stimulus they should largely because of the negative effects of the trade war a report from ball state notes the trump administration s 2018 tax cuts and jobs act was meant to spur private non residential investment but whatever effect could have been expected was muted by a similarly large tax increase due to tariffs associated with the trade war we are running a budget deficit of 1 1 trillion which is considerably more than the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 hicks said that was obama s large stimulus package passed in february 2009 that was only 856 billion as economists across the region watch for signs of the next recession they also look to infrastructure investment as an area for potential growth the ohio valley has massive funding needs for its roads broadband internet access and aging water systems

today i discuss us iran tensions syndicated debt issuance and implications for euro and scandi markets the us iran conflict escalated following us assassination of general soleimani on 3 january and iran s largely symbolic retaliation early wednesday on wednesday we arranged a conference call with heather a conley who is an expert in geopolitics and international security at the center for strategic and international studies in washington heather argued that we should expect a broader regional retaliation through proxy groups close to tehran with the retaliation concentrated in the middle east she expects that retaliation is likely to take years the intensity will increase but both the us and iran are keen to avoid a direct confrontation despite the severe risk of human casualties in my view us iran tensions will only influence financial markets if they have an impact on the economic outlook and the behaviour of market participants where the transmission channel would be through oil prices see e g here for my take on the link between political uncertainty and financial markets most likely heightened us iran tensions will not be a key driver of oil markets and thereby on overall market sentiment as long as oil supply for example in iraq is not damaged the perception that the global economy is recovering also supports the buoyant market sentiment in my view the global macro backdrop is indeed constructive but nothing more than that we expect a shallow global growth recovery led by large emerging market countries which have eased monetary policy substantially i expect the us to slow modestly as the impact from trump s tax reform fades and private consumption moderates but loose financial conditions will cushion the slowdown the gradual pick up in asia led by china stimulus will spill over to the eurozone but german manufacturing remains remarkably weak continuing woes in the german auto sector support our view that it is too early for eur usd to head substantially higher the eur syndicated debt market recorded its largest weekly issuance that we have tracked according to our chief strategist on covered bonds and financials sverre holbek the issuance was split between financials eur20 3bn ssas eur17 8bn corporates eur12 5bn covered eur10 3bn and sovereigns eur8 5bn m arkets absorbed the substantial supply very well with new issue premiums at low levels and secondary spreads only widening very marginally the solid performance mirrors the sentiment among end investors where european debt funds witnessed modest inflows whereas equity funds experienced outflows for the week ending 8 january spreads are very compressed across the credit spectrum but i believe european equities may still head higher near term given the shallow upturn in the cycle and relative valuation the positive equity sentiment may still provide some cushion for credit spreads issuance is set to continue next week albeit likely at slightly lower levels ahead of the silent period which for many companies begins in the week starting 20 january note that the silent period starts earlier for e g several european banks the large issuance has led to a modest tightening in german asw i e lower swap rates relative to bond yields as some issuers swap fixed rate debt to floating our chief fixed income analyst jens peter sørensen argues that bund asw should widen again due to the negative net supply of german government bonds in january on the back of redemptions and ecb buying in our scandi markets we argue that the minutes from the riksbank meeting where they hiked rates in december to 0 revealed that the central bank was uncomfortable with the risk of negative rates being perceived as something permanent which could have undesired effects on behaviour riksbank s concern resembles the ones raised by other central banks and official institutions see here for a discussion still we interpret the minutes as slightly dovish which supports our be arish view on the swedish krona as argued by our sek strategist stefan mellin in norway we argue that the market is too dovish on norges bank while heavy nok issuance could tighten nok eur rates spreads further we believe that nok could strengthen a bit further but fading risk appetite is a risk in denmark we argue in our flagship reading the markets denmark publication led by our head of fixed income research jan weber østergaard that 30y 2 callable bonds should outperform short dated non callable bonds if yields rise slightly note that going forward reading the markets denmark will be a weekly publication where we will focus on the most topical themes across danish fi and fx markets finally i want to flag that our credit research team have provided an overview of potential nordic corporate issuers in 2020 in eur sek and nok based on our estimate of their funding surplus in the coming year publicly known strategies e g ongoing changes in the capital structure and upcoming redemptions download the full article

lifesciences and visa we added to nvidia tractor supply electronic arts cdw corp motorola solutions bookings holdings and bristol myers motorola solutions msi reported 7 revenue growth driven by software and services growth of 12 along with continued margin expansion recall that motorola solutions primary business is providing specialized communication infrastructure equipment and software to public safety law enforcement and increasingly to large corporations motorola s backlog of sales to these customers which we typically use as a reasonable proxy for future revenue growth was up 17 overall and up 26 in the higher margin software and services segment as such we continue to believe motorola solutions has room to accelerate top and bottom line growth while the stock continues to exhibit an undemanding market multiple rare in our view whereby almost any company these days exhibiting double digit growth commands rich multiples we eliminated c h robinson chrw and ulta beauty ulta from the portfolios during the quarter to fund better growth opportunities over the past year or so c h robinson benefitted from a pronounced tightening in truckload tl supply however more recently management made the decision to compete on price in order to take share as tl supply loosened relative to 2018 s historical supply crunch we prefer to invest in businesses that execute strategies that can enhance returns rather than simply compete on price so we sold c h robinson ulta beauty reported a slowdown in sales growth particularly in its core u s cosmetics business which management attributed to a decline in the overall u s cosmetics category while the u s cosmetics industry is not likely to shrink in perpetuity we think ulta s expense structure is ill suited to handle slower growth and expect returns will suffer as the business is reset to slower growth apple aapl financial reported better growth than investors were expecting as the company s foreign exchange neutral revenues in china recovered to positive growth apple s shares finished substantially higher for the year driven by earnings multiple expansion we believe to be related to expectations for the company s upcoming next generation 5g product cycle we trimmed our outsized apple positions in order to fund new portfolio holdings bringing our weighting to around 9 remarkably the russell

growth and also managed to keep expenses in line with that growth we believe facebook is approaching the end of a period of heightened expense growth which was in response to privacy related scrutiny the company received early in 2018 nvidia nvda financial one of our newer positions continued strong sequential growth in both gaming and datacenter processor sales against the backdrop of diminishing marginal improvements from traditional general compute chip manufacturers i e intel we expect the relentless demand from compute intensive applications such as artificial intelligence ai to continue to drive growth across nvidia s ubiquitous compute acceleration platform company commentaries alphabet alphabet s goog financial googl financial core google subsidiary continues to show accelerating growth driven by youtube advertising and share gains in google cloud platform gcp with the latter competing against microsoft azure and amazon s aws in addition to continued revenue growth we think alphabet has ample room to improve both margins and capital allocation over the next several years and drive excess returns over the years we have seen google change its search and advertising algorithms on a regular basis and sometimes those changes can have a disproportionate impact on quarterly revenues but they are usually temporary after dropping to mid teens growth in the first quarter of the year from the mid 20 s during 2018 shares sold off and provided an attractive opportunity to add to positions given alphabet s history of tweaking its google model and the associated short term effects since then advertising revenue growth has accelerated and is back to nearly 20 growth importantly google s owned and operated properties continue to exhibit healthy growth which are higher margin revenues relative to its largely pass through network member revenues a key driver of google property growth continues to be mobile search as well as increased monetization of youtube idc estimates that around 8 in 10 smartphones shipped globally are android based which typically come preinstalled with google search and or google s mobile browser as for apple ios devices iphones and ipads we estimate google s traffic acquisition costs tac for apple device traffic has plateaued over the past year or so and expect the growth of this expense to be more in line with ios device growth we estimate mid single digits longer term and should represent an attractive opportunity for margin expansion as for youtube alphabet s management considers it to be tac free so continued strong growth in this google property should help bolster ex tac revenue longer term as well earlier this year alphabet gave a bit of incremental disclosure about the size and growth of its gcp service which provides cloud infrastructure as a service to developers and it departments we estimate that this platform is likely outgrowing industry leaders aws and microsoft azure albeit from a smaller revenue base while the company does not disclose its cloud profitability we expect gcp to drive incremental profit dollar growth as this business gets larger and utilization rates increase alphabet also has a couple of return enhancing capital allocation options at its disposal first alphabet is sitting on a mountain of cash around 120 billion and should generate close to 25 billion in free cash flow during 2019 we expect the company to double its free cash flow over the next couple years with just a modicum of capital expenditure discipline second if alphabet s historical trend of few large acquisitions continues we would expect the company to buy back stock at what would be a very attractive forward free cash flow multiple especially relative to drop dead i e negative rates on debt issuance around the globe last we think alphabet s other bets which represents a gaggle of non core under disclosed money torching projects that have very little bearing on google s business could easily be wound down we estimate this could save shareholders between 3 billion and 5 billion per year and could be used to reduce the company s share count or supplement m a booking holdings as we have been writing since booking bkng financial began discussing a change in its advertising strategy back in 2017 we believe investors have completely failed to grasp the significance of the company s strategic initiatives over the past few years booking had found that traditional search engine optimization seo advertising primarily with google was not generating the return in bookings revenue and profits that it had generated in the past furthermore booking noted this was in some part due to metasearch providers such as tripadvisor of which booking was the most important customer competing directly with its online travel agency customers for bookings by investing in seo themselves rather than staying in their lane and functioning solely as a search service this dwindling return on advertising spend had led to continually shrinking margins as booking had to invest more and more to generate the same level of booking growth booking laid out a clearly articulated strategy to reduce its reliance on seo advertising as well as its spend with the metasearch providers that were using booking s own ad dollars to compete against it and it proceeded to execute this strategy exactly as laid out this led to slowing but still healthy bookings growth but it also led to rapidly accelerating profit growth exactly as planned furthermore and more importantly its business model developed less reliance on more expensive forms of advertising such as seo and its strategy changed the behavior of the major metasearch providers dissuading the company from competing directly against its customers such as booking we believe the considerable success of these initiatives if the company s profit growth over the past few years and struggles and strategy swings from its peers were not proof enough emerged in the third quarter 2019 earnings season a day after two of its large peers expedia and tripadvisor reported massive profit shortfalls due to a change in google s landing page methodology that had caused these companies seo spend to generate lower returns in their respective bookings booking reported that the quarter had been just fine and that it didn t really have much exposure to seo any longer basically while the rest of the industry is still relying on the advertising model booking was using 2 3 years ago booking has reworked its model in a more efficient way generating roughly the same bookings growth as everyone else but doing it more efficiently we continue to see very clear proof that the company s strategic initiatives of the past three years which have gone largely misunderstood and unappreciated by the broad market have caused a positive shift in the company s business model and in the structure of the overall industry both of which are firmly in the company s favor whether the market ever fully appreciates this theoretically or not we believe the reality of the company s dominant and growing market position will continue to make this company a long term winner in an attractive growing industry copart copart cprt financial is the largest company in the automotive salvage and auction industry the industry is a duopoly with the company commanding a 40 market share insurance auto auctions is the company s only competitor of size or scale the company generates about 80 of its revenue in the u s the other 20 is generated in international markets the u k generates the lions share at 15 the rest is spread out in newer markets that include canada brazil ireland germany spain the u a e bahrain finland and ireland copart owns the largest global buying network which essentially matches global demand with local supply the demand for salvage autos is a mix of dismantlers and rebuilders of used and refurbished auto parts that serve the auto repair market whereby salvaged parts are considerably cheaper than new or oem parts demand for autos that are damaged but worthy of repair has become a staple of international demand whereby repaired cars are not subject onerous safety regulations with the company s advent of nationwide and global online salvage bidding additional demand for complete drivable autos from used car dealers and individuals has become quite significant in the demand mix insurance companies processing totaled autos make up the bulk 87 of the supply of auctioned autos copart has long relationships with state farm allstate nationwide and farmers geico recently signed on which could easily yield 130 000 autos per year in supply other supply parties include charities banks rental car companies fleet operators and auto dealers copart acts as an agent earning fees from both buyers and sellers for decades the industry has been a rough and tumble affair dominated by local mom and pop barbed wire salvage yard owners serving local state and regional northeastern markets that is until copart entered the scene copart was founded in northern california in 1982 by born entrepreneur willis johnson johnson was in a hurry but growth was slow during his first ten years on the back of private loans johnson has acquired three more yards in northern california recognizing the network and scale effects plus the operational leverage of just a few additional salvage yards johnson s insatiable desire for growth could only be quenched by more yards that took more money a lot more money johnson took the company public in 1994 the 27 million in fresh equity capital was quickly put to use by march 1994 copart added eight more yards and significantly expanded geographically with the purchase of north texas salvage pool in dallas texas by 2004 copart owned over 100 locations and was generating 400 million in annual revenues arguably one of johnson s most significant strategic decisions was his very early use of information technology as early as 1992 johnson gave auto insurers online access to track salvage sales these early technology initiatives led to the creation of copart auction system cas in 1997 which allowed sellers access to a myriad of information in 1998 copart launched a true ebay like internet based auction system the days of the traditional local in person salvage auctions were numbered in 2003 the company released vb squared which opened up the auction process to registered buyers and sellers on a global basis in 2010 johnson passed on the role of ceo to his son in law jayson adair who has been an executive with the company since 1989 fast forwarding to the current decade of unabated growth copart reached the 10 million auction unit milestone and built network capacity in the u s and u k of over 500 000 autos by 2012 when hurricane sandy hit on the eve of thanksgiving that year the company was tested as never before hurricane sandy affected 24 states including the entire eastern seaboard from florida to maine up west across the appalachian mountains and finally to wisconsin and michigan severe damage even went as far as new york and new jersey copart employees worked 60 straight days including thanksgiving some 325 company employees outfitted with 575 car transporters worked around the clock in 90 days the company picked up over 85 000 cars more than during a given year at the time at its peak the company picked up 2 300 autos in a single day the damaged autos would consume 11 acres of storage per day 2013 brought the acquisition of quad cities salvage auctions and desert view auto auctions donation vehicles for charities vb cubed rolled out the new auction platform now included non members and expanded the buyer base auction attendance was up sharply 48 for the year the company launched its mobile app on iphone and ipad the bidding on the new app grew quickly to 10 of all bidding by the next year mobile auction attendance more than tripled 214 and mobile made up 23 of all auction attendance by 2016 19 of winning bids came from mobile and the mobile app would be downloaded in nearly 200 countries on the international front 2013 saw the expansion into brazil spain dubai and germany 2014 saw 400 000 new registered members globally 2015 witnessed significant growth in germany and spain and expansions in both oman and bahrain by the end of 2015 the company operated 175 locations worldwide including 25 outside of the u s auctions went live in germany and spain during 2016 over the past five years physical inventory more than doubled to over 200 yards covering 9 000 acres the company s capex continues to accelerate to three times its 10 year average today the company operates 200 yards with over 9 500 acres on a typical day the company has around 200 000 vehicles for sale on its auction website today about 50 of all auction cars are sold inside of state yards 30 are sold across state lines and 20 are sold outside the u s according to the company 75 of all u s based auctions receive a bid from an international buyer scrap and salvage yards have long possessed the classic not in my backyard competitive advantages over the years more stringent local state and federal regulations have served to amp up nimby attributes as mentioned willis johnson early on saw firsthand the economic benefits of local network effects of size and scale in terms of growth and profitability the network scaling leap from local to state to nationwide and ultimately international via both hard asset raw land and a huge fleet of transporters plus captive insurance companies totaling a greater proportion of accident damaged autos combined with technological assets of best in class internet mobile auction sites has produced manifold operating leverage to wit over the past decade the company s average revenue per location has increased over 50 7 1 million vs 4 6 million and average net income per location has soared 150 2 0 million vs 79 million as 2020 clocks in copart is riding a wave of both company specific growth drivers plus industry specific drivers on the industry front copart s supply of prospective auctioned and salvaged vehicles continues to be robust due to the rise of accident frequencies due to the combination of aging vehicles almost 12 years on average increasing driver distractions smartphones and rising miles driven at least in most geographies in addition the rising complexity of new autos particularly since 2014 has resulted in a marked increase in the frequency in total losses from insurance companies think of your current newer car as a series of a few dozen small computers some connected to each other and related perimeter sensors and cameras fastened upon four rubber tires in addition new technologies like lidar a laser wavelength surveying method and detection that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with pulsed laser light and measuring the reflected pulses with a sensor used to make digital 3 d representations of the approaching target will become standard technologies in the near years along with related self driving enhancements even seemingly minor fender benders have become prohibitively expensive to repair due to a wicked combination of expensive electronic parts replacement the growing time needed to make such repairs and related cost of insurance plan rental coverage and the lack of mechanics and auto technicians with the necessary expertise the resultant lumpy increase in the average selling prices of salvages autos has been a boon to the company s bottom line such trends will likely never abate and will likely get worse as ev vehicles become mainstream ask a tesla owner how long it takes a certified mechanic to repair even a small dent in their car and ask them too how much their insurance coverage has soared over the past few years according to copart autos totaled by the insurance industry which had flat lined at around 14 of total claims have charted a new path upward each year since 2014 and have now reached 20 of total claims a technological aside according to tony seba author and entrepreneur at his recent presentation at the robin hood conference google early on estimated that its lidar system which originally cost 150 000 to build would cost just 70 000 by 2012 at the time industry watchers and analysts sneered at google s estimate google proved itself correct its lidar systems cost in 2012 did indeed fall to just 70 000 remarkably still in just 12 months time that same equipment cost 10 000 one year later in 2014 the cost dropped sharply to just 1 000 and then three years later to just 250 seba also noted that as recently as 2000 a top computer used for nuclear warfare simulations had a capacity of 1 teraflop 1 trillion floating point operations per second cost 46 million used 850 kilowatts of energy and took up 1 600 square feet by 2017 nvidia had developed a 2 3 teraflop computer that cost 59 used 15 watts of energy and was small enough to fit in your pocket the combo of both company specific operating levers plus booming industry specific fundamentals has manifested itself in the company s impressive profitability and growth over the past five fiscal years july the company s return on assets and return on profitability have doubled to 26 and 31 respectively over the same period annual revenues have almost doubled to just over 2 billion and earnings per share has nearly tripled in the latest fiscal first quarter of 2020 the company reported the second consecutive quarter of 20 auction revenue the fifth consecutive quarter beating consensus eps expectations and the third consecutive quarter of double digit u s revenue per unit growth fleetcor technologies we initiated a position in fleetcor technologies flt financial a global provider of fleet and workforce payment solutions fleetcor is primarily focused on business to business b2b payments and operates across five spend categories fuel lodging tolls corporate payments and gift in the most generalized terms fleetcor simplifies the way businesses manage and pay for expenses b2b payments are evolving from paper checks and ach which are still the most common b2b payments methods 2 to electronic payment delivery which can take many forms and fleetcor is at the forefront of this transition benefiting from the continued secular shift to electronic payments the company uses both proprietary and third party networks mastercard in the u s visa in the u k and europe as well as others to deliver its payment solutions its customers tend to have recurring revenue models and specialized networks which create barriers to entry for competition to compete at any sort of scale this can be evidenced by the company s near duopoly in their largest product category its fuel payment product line in addition the solutions tend to be specialized for specific spend categories fuel lodging etc and or specific customer segments for example the long haul transportation industry we also note that mastercard and visa have stated priorities to penetrate b2b payments aggressively and both of these major payment processors view fleetcor as a useful partner in expanding their reach into this area among fleetcor s five primary spend categories the fuel payment product is the largest segment making up about 45 of total revenues and customers partners of this segment include major oil companies fuel marketers and businesses with small to medium sized fleets this segment offers customers discounts to the retail price of fuel and helps control unauthorized spending this is a service to both the fuel provider and to the fuel consumer while we view this core segment as an attractive business fleetcor has made a concerted effort to diversify the overall business into related categories this fuel segment made up as much as 70 of the business only a few years ago the lodging payment product one of the smaller segments functions similarly to the fuel product and often serves a customer base that overlaps with the fuel program in 2016 fleetcor entered the toll payments line through its acquisition of stp in brazil this acquisition brought the 2nd largest toll company in the world under the fleetcor umbrella and its 5 million toll users the corporate payments product optimizes corporate spending for businesses offering the use of virtual cards to enhance security and increase automation and savings finally the small gift payment product a gift card management service rounds out its business segments in total the company has generated strong double digit growth in the non fuel products both organic and through acquisition contributing to the ongoing diversification away from fuel card segment fleetcor has developed a growth algorithm to grow through m a or what the company terms build buy partner whereby it will grow through a combination of building its existing infrastructure organically by investing in sales and marketing buying businesses through either small tuck in acquisitions or the occasional large acquisition or partner with large third parties or major oil companies in order to enter markets the company currently does not have a presence in today fleetcor targets to be in as many of the top 25 gdp markets around the world as is practical and it will do this primarily through its m a strategy more recently fleetcor has developed additional growth drivers coined beyond fuel and beyond toll these initiatives essentially are a means by which it uses its existing product categories of fuel and toll and offer ways to get more spend from existing customers through these categories in the beyond fuel initiative fleetcor is expanding the revenue per transaction of existing customers in the u s and u k by expanding the purchases it can offer on their fuel cards the company still offers great control for management teams over what can be purchased but it is opening up the spend to construction supplies service maintenance etc for its fleet customers while at the same time still preventing unauthorized spending on the card similarly beyond toll is for the company s toll product in brazil where the toll tag has been expanded to be read by scanners in parking garages gas stations and even fast food restaurants fleetcor operates in the very attractive electronic payments space and currently trades at a valuation level below that of our existing payment names in the portfolio yet growing at similar levels the company generates 1 billion in free cash flow annually providing ample cash to continue its build buy partner strategy it has laid out 2019 targets for 9 11 organic revenue growth and 15 20 eps growth achieved through organic growth initiatives accretive acquisitions and occasional share repurchases as fleetcor pushes to double the size of its business every four years we believe the company is well positioned to be a healthy growth name in an attractive industry well capable of achieving that goal s p global during the quarter we initiated positions in s p global spgi financial spgi has several unique assets that benefit from a couple of strong secular trends that should drive attractive double digit earnings growth s p s ratings business is in a virtual duopoly and should be a long term beneficiary of perpetually low interest rates low rates and active central bank purchases of corporate debt should help debt issuance trends remain robust even in a lower gdp growth environment in addition we think the ratings business still has room to scale and drive margin expansion s p s market intelligence is a low price information service offering growing user base at a double digit clip as it breaks into non financial industry verticals s p indices segment is highly profitable due to very little overhead and continues to grow along with passive asset under management equity flows especially into etfs we expect s p will grow revenues in a mid to high single digit range and possibly faster if global capital markets continue to expand thanks to routine central bank intervention the company also has room to leverage its expense structure by taking higher pricing in its market dominant ratings business and indices segments we started portfolios with a half position and look to increase our weighting if valuation reverts closer to historical averages tractor supply company we added to our long term holding tractor supply tsco financial during the quarter as what we view as largely irrational short term noise led some investors to take profits on the stock after it had more than doubled in the prior two years primarily we believe the market suddenly decided to trade the stock as an oil stock several months ago which is interesting on a few fronts not least because the price of oil has been very steady in the 50s for the past year and topping 60 early in 2020 on the most recent round of geopolitical concerns although the company has a not meaningless portion of its stores in oil producing states roughly 10 in texas for example we do not view flattish oil price trends as a notable problem we would note that management did specifically call out the oil producing regions as a drag on the business in 2016 before we bought the stock but only after oil had collapsed from over 100 to below 30 from 2014 through early 2016 for a decline of roughly 75 in the current cycle the industry is running less than 20 below the 2018 peak furthermore the texas rig count which likewise collapsed by roughly 80 in that 2014 2016 period is running approximately 25 below its 2018 peak today while rig count over these last two cycles cannot be used as an apples to apples comparison because a rig today is more efficient than a rig five years ago directionally there is a loose correlation between rig count and employment activity in the industry so while we agree that a decline in the texas rig count is not a positive influence on tractor s overall business we also do not view this as a meaningful detractor additionally and arguably of greater relevance some investors have been concerned with the company s plans to replace its retiring chief executive officer greg sandfort tractor supply s board announced in august that it had decided not to pursue its prior plan to elevate the chief operating officer to the role of chief executive officer upon mr sandfort s retirement within a few months the company had announced an alternative replacement for mr sandfort and we do not believe there will be any change to the very successful long term corporate strategy that has been developed through the tenures of many senior executives in this company for approximately fifteen years we do believe however that this was another factor that caused some shareholders to book their solid gains over the past few years aside from these two issues we know any physical retailer will be continually open to shorter term weather nuances positive and negative and the occasional freak out from the investment world generally related to amazon but occasionally due to other factors as the market loves to find reasons to dismiss these companies despite clear evidence that many of them i e tractor best buy walmart target are using their physical store and distribution assets as an advantage versus online competition as our clients will have noticed over the past several years this usually leads us to attempt to pick off the higher quality growing assets on pullbacks when valuation is very attractive that is what we have attempted to do with this latest addition to our tractor supply holding punch bowl redux the stock market ended the decade in extraordinary fashion all major stock market indices and averages are at all time highs in fact literally all financial assets were in the green in 2019 longer dated u s treasury bonds had their best year since 2002 maybe bonds do have more fun the classic 60 40 stock bond portfolio had its best year since 1997 the stock market led the return parade in 2019 the s p 500 index gained 31 5 its best year since 2013 we began the year in these letters describing the radical turnaround in the federal reserve s monetary policy to one from tightening to significant easing as the fed s powell co scoop up t bills almost as fast as the u s treasury prints them we sympathize with purists who opine that such policy really isn t quantitative easing qe since the fed is not specifically purchasing coupon bearing treasuries perhaps so but the reflexive animal spirit actions and consequences of investors bear the hallmark of previous qe adventures i e don t fight the fed over the course of 2019 the fed cut rates three times 75 basis points in total and in little more than four months increased the size of its balance sheet by over 400 billion a de facto interest rate cut of at least an additional 50 basis points remarkably powell co cuts rates with the unemployment rate below 4 a first the final 25 basis point cut came at the juncture of the stock market at an all time high and with the unemployment rate at a 50 year low 3 5 stunning and right on historic cue in pavlovian turn little else mattered to investors except an omnipotent central bank with its foot jammed on the monetary policy accelerator indeed during just twelve months the stock market responded in kind with a rare four point expansion in its p e multiple trailing p e multiple of 21 6x from 16 5x and forward p e multiple of 18 3x from 14 3x such a valuation multiple sprint has rarely if ever occurred outside of the final months of a recession and this was the largest increase since the last days of the 2001 recession technology stocks were by far the biggest winner in 2019 soaring 50 see table below the nasdaq 100 gained 38 its best year since 2009 technology stocks etf xlk have nearly doubled since 2017 no other sector has even been close over the past three years the second best sector since 2017 was consumer discretionary up 61 third was healthcare up 55 technology stocks have become so large that the five largest components of the benchmark russell 1000 growth index apple microsoft alphabet amazon and facebook now make up a whopping 30 of the benchmark the sharp 2019 gain in both apple and microsoft dominated the gain in the s p 500 index along with facebook and alphabet no other decision has been more paramount or fatal for active managers than their allocation to technology stocks over the past few years an aside according to bofa for the decade the growth index outperformed no crushed value by a whopping 107 312 vs 205 leading in 8 of 10 years in our third quarter letter we wrote our view that the stock market has priced in a soft economic landing economic indicators flashing yellow and red warnings of increased recession risks have been completely ignored seemingly no more worries of stall speed gdp growth flat to inverted yield curves ism manufacturing index 47 2 at the lowest levels since june 2009 four decelerating quarters of corporate profits and china trade wars have quelled the stock market s unrelenting advance to ever higher pieces and to ever higher valuations the playbook for the stock market would seem to be quite binary if not simplistically so if the fed calls it mission accomplished and once again tries to normalize drain the punch bowl then economic and corporate fundamentals may once again dictate investor s appetite for equities more than likely at the first whiff of softer economic growth we expect powell co to lend the fed s balance sheet to once again buttress any downside pain in the stock market indeed in a recently posted report on the fed s website michael kiley deputy director of the fed s stability unit stated even a modest recession may result in near zero interest rates at long maturities bringing u s experience closer to that seen in europe and japan and so it goes we wish to once again thank those clients who

issuing by far the worst economic outlook for sri lanka this year the world bank last week said the country could entangle in a toxic mix of elevated fiscal deficit and debt and the economy would struggle to break the 4 0 percent growth mark during next three years the world bank issues periodic forecasts on world economies and such projections are revised and re revised several times a year the multilateral lender is known to come up with common policy prescriptions for every country under its watch irrespective of their economic structure cultural sensitivities governance and polity its latest publication titled global economic prospects slow growth policy challenges predicts sri lanka s economy to grow 3 3 percent this year and 3 7 percent in the next two years this is much lower than the government s projected growth of 6 5 percent and the central bank s projection of 4 5 percent growth for 2020 sri lanka s economic growth in 2019 is estimated to have languished at 2 7 percent lowest since 2001 it appears that the multilateral lender had been oblivious of the changes that were taking place in the governance structure substantial reforms to the country s fiscal policy and relaxing of regulations to make doing business easy in the last two months lack of progress in reforms to improve tax collection could result in more acute revenue shortfalls bangladesh sri lanka and put further pressure on elevated fiscal deficits the world bank stated sri lanka raised both indirect and direct taxes in 2016 and replaced the existing tax law with a new act with the sole premise of increasing government revenue however that singular purpose had wide implications on the rest of the economic actors and the higher taxes failed to bring the intended tax revenue in the short to medium term sri lanka may have to run an elevated fiscal deficit to fund the growth and implement structural reforms according to some of the country s economic analysts during this period sri lanka is required to lay the platform to build key business sectors which can generate foreign earnings while re calibrating its foreign relations to strike commercial deals with bilateral partners who can bring technological competence into the country they opine the world bank meanwhile forecast heightened external risks for south asian economies including sri lanka due to the sharper than expected slowdown in the united states and euro areas on the contrary the latest economic indications point that the us economy is on a firm footing with full employment and the euro area is also showing signs of recovery from its depths with inflation and growth picking up for countries with elevated debt levels and large current account deficits pakistan sri lanka an unexpected tightening in global financing conditions could sharply raise borrowing costs and lead to stops in capital inflows the world bank cautioned

outlook we saw a headline on friday expect more dollar falls as the fed may cut rates we were stunned huh the fed has had speakers out in force for the past three weeks all saying the us is in a good place an outdated use of language but still unmistakable the fed has no intention of changing rates in either direction nobody at the fed expects any rate change this year not until the numbers change and by a lot last fall chair powell said i think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that s persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns he could just as easily have said the same thing about cutting rates we would need a really significant move first the reason not to be explicit symmetrically is obvious trump wants more cuts and a wise man doesn t poke the bear we can expect the same message at the next fomc on jan 28 29 too granted if there is a change coming this year it s likely on the side of a cut but way off in the future so far slowing job growth is cyclically normal and unemployment is at a 50 year low the fed now accepts that its earlier idea was wrong about how low unemployment could go before it started to drive inflation up it s conceivable that falling capital investment falling output falling hiring and other measures can point toward a cut not to mention trumpian belittling and berating but we have zero evidence and not a shred of implication that a cut is on the table on the whole the economy is rumbling along at 2 or so recession is not really likely nor is inflation assuming no shocks and no war earnings are likely okay to improving now that the china trade war is over sort of the stock market is safe so is the dollar depending on interest rate developments elsewhere see the atlanta fed gdpnow chart it s for q4 but the point is that the model shows a nice upswing from 1 5 in november to 2 3 as of jan 10 the atlanta fed notes that the jobs report contributed but also real personal consumption expenditures grew by 2 4 from 2 3 and real gross private domestic investment growth worsened from 2 5 to 2 7 we continue to worry about this drop in capital spending but that too can improve if stabilization is the key concept this week brings a conventional platter of data the us deficit cpi retail sales and on friday china s gdp the message so far has two parts first the us got through the tariff situation without the us economy stumbling the farm sector suffered and got relief in the form of 22 billion in subsidies according to npr we have seen numbers as high as 38 billion in addition the us consumer keeps rolling along despite some horrible problems unbearable student debt auto loan defaults but just enough inflation to inspire spending and not enough inflation to scare anyone when it comes to china it doesn t matter if the upcoming data is accurate if china wants to pretend the trade war barely affected it that s good for everyone else too it means china won t get nasty and retaliate in any meaningful way besides we do see increasing disclosure and transparency about loan and bond defaults for example time has not been entirely wasted trump is a liar and a fraud but the china trade war was not completely useless trump got nearly all of his facts and tactics wrong but he was not wrong that the system designed mostly by the us was failing the us he can t be said to have set it right but everybody gets the point which is that the us can elect a president who demands better treatment for the us that nato members pay their bills that tariffs are possible if the wto is too slow and cumbersome etc the cost to the us reputation is far too high but if you close your eyes nearly shut you can just see barely why the trump base approves of his macho bs politics our favorite international commentator fareed zakaria wrote trump does not have a foreign policy he has a series of impulses isolationism unilateralism bellicosity some of them completely contradictory one might surge at any particular moment triggered usually by trump s sense that he might look weak or foolish the us historically thinks through its moves carefully but that hard won reputation is now being squandered in arena after arena around the globe we are impressed by the threat to cut off iraq s access to its bank account at the ny fed if it goes through with demanding the us pull all its troops from the country the wsj never does come right out and state who exactly made that threat just naming the white house but the article is crystal clear it s a huge and perhaps fatal blow to iraq which is in no position to annoy the us the bank account is mightier than the sword or something there is talk of weaponizing the dollar a silly term being applied willy nilly everywhere these days the subject is not really the dollar it s the banking system the banking system is easily circumvented too iraq can easily remove its deposits in the us and into london just as russia did back in the 1970 s setting off the invention of the eurodollar system out of whole cloth or it could move its dough into euros or the chinese currency or any other currency oil may be priced in dollars but nothing says it has to be kept there the problem is that much of what iraq wants to buy is priced in dollars especially weapons but also consumer goods like electronics and food after all countries keep reserves in the first place in order to have immediate access to food and weapons but liquidity can be had in euros or pounds too as things now stand though freezing iraqi money is a serious threat it s hardball it will be interesting to see if trump goes through with demanding payment for the us bases a kind of reparations there is historical precedent not only

when atlas shrugs the great default from 2009 have you ever heard this argument the national debt is too high we are laying an enormous burden onto our children it is misleading in what way because our children like atlas in ayn rand s novel will shrug they will send congress a message no more congress always responds to immediate threats regarding future sanctions whenever congress thinks the voters will remember a vote at the next election and will probably impose negative sanctions on incumbents congress always sees the light when we feel the heat we see the light said senator everett dirksen a generation ago his observation still holds true our children are not going to pay off the suckers us who naïvely thought they could pass on the old maid of government debt to them here is economic reality taxpayers and treasury debt buyers are paying for all of the benefits that voters enjoy as recipients of government funded programs voters are not transferring these costs to future generations costs are inescapably the same as benefits if we receive present benefits someone pays for these benefits in the present the only questions are these who wins who loses how soon economists despair about their inability to get across this simple idea we consume only present goods economics students nod their heads in agreement with the professor yes yes we know that but they don t know it as soon as they start to vote they forget the economics of the cookie jar when you catch your child with his hand in the cookie jar you can be certain of one thing he is after a present cookie you can also be sure of something else he does not intend to replace that cookie he is driven by the desire for present gratification when you think of child with its hand in the cookie jar think congress the difference is a child will not respond to being caught with these words this is in the best interests of the nation we are acting as an agent of the people everyone deserves a fair share we owe it to ourselves we promise to replace this cookie with two cookies of equal or greater value in ten years think of national economic production as a cookie factory people are employed to produce cookies they eat cookies but they also make cookies if they made no cookies could they eat cookies only those cookies already in the cookie jar if because of a war the government tells the public that from now on we must support the troops this means that those at work in the cookie factory must send cookies to the troops the troops will be consuming cookies they will not be producing cookies the costs of war in his radio address to the nation on december 9 1941 president roosevelt did his best to substitute the inspirational word privilege for the economically correct word sacrifice this was a way to describe costs as benefits on the road ahead there lies hard work grueling work day and night every hour and every minute i was about to add that ahead there lies sacrifice for all of us but it is not correct to use that word the united states does not consider it a sacrifice to do all one can to give one s best to our nation when the nation is fighting for its existence and its future life it is not a sacrifice for any man old or young to be in the army or the navy of the united states rather it is a privilege it is not a sacrifice for the industrialist or the wage earner the farmer or the shopkeeper the trainmen or the doctor to pay more taxes to buy more bonds to forego extra profits to work longer or harder at the task for which he is best fitted rather it is a privilege it is not a sacrifice to do without many things to which we are accustomed if the national defense calls for doing without it a review this morning leads me to the conclusion that at present we shall not have to curtail the normal use of articles of food there is enough food today for all of us and enough left over to send to those who are fighting on the same side with us but there will be a clear and definite shortage of metals for many kinds of civilian use for the very good reason that in our increased program we shall need for war purposes more than half of that portion of the principal metals which during the past year have gone into articles for civilian use yes we shall have to give up many things entirely and i am sure that the people in every part of the nation are prepared in their individual living to win this war i am sure that they will cheerfully help to pay a large part of its financial cost while it goes on i am sure they will cheerfully give up those material things that they are asked to give up in other words the cookie jar would soon suffer a substantial increase in demand from people who were no longer engaged in the production and distribution of cookies he predicted that those americans who were still involved in the production of cookies would cheerfully eat fewer cookies for the sake of the troops but just in case this cheerfulness waned the president oversaw the creation of the war production board which came into existence on january 16 1942 it set up a rationing system the costs of destruction when a member of the military dies in action he pays the ultimate price there is no deferral of payment he is gone he has to be replaced someone else must now put his life on the line there is no bond market for human lives during world war ii there is no illusion among gold star mothers that this cost of the war could be passed on to a future generation a grave marked the end of that particular generation wherever the occupant had not fathered a child in europe tens of millions of civilian graves marked the reduction of the size of future generations there was no bond market for these productive assets either what voters understand clearly with respect to the most productive assets human beings they do not understand with respect to all other productive assets a crashed airplane a burned out tank a demolished jeep they are all junk they are all finished as assets they were paid for but they are worthless now except as scrap metal on a battlefield they must be replaced what is the difference between the productivity of a burned out tank and the men who died in that tank scrap metal value the burned out tank may be worth more than the remains of those who died inside it we do not like to think this way but from the point of view of economics it is true the bond market in a popular war there is a war bond market the mark of an unpopular war is the absence of any war bond market the last american war bond market was in world war ii the u s government sold war bonds in world war ii the total by the end of the program in 1946 was 186 billion in early 1940 s dollars a gigantic amount the war finance committee and the war advertising council spent more money on this ad campaign than any other in the history of american advertising but why did the government sell them if the cost of the war in men and material was paid for by those on the battlefield who suffered and died as well as by the folks back home who had to reduce their consumption what did the war bond produce of economic value a war bond could not reduce the loss of human life it could not reduce the number of burned out tanks in short a war bond could not reduce the cost of the war then why sell them the reason was motivation the cookie jar was being depleted day by day this meant that replacements were necessary folks back home who were engaged in war production would have to reduce their consumption this output had to replace whatever had been lost let us return to the three crucial questions which folks would have to cut back which folks wouldn t for how long the war bond drives persuaded half of the folks back home to forego present income for the sake of future income income in what form pieces of paper with dead politicians pictures on them no the promised future income would be america s survival as an independent nation the appeal made by the government to buy war bonds was not the promise of personal economic gain in the future it was to win the war by supporting the troops then who were the winners those americans who refused to buy war bonds and who saved their extra money to make down payments on unimproved land especially in the los angeles area or in westchester county north of new york city the bond sellers never explained how buying a war bond supported the war effort they did not say the following buy a war bond so that you will not be tempted to use your money to compete in the consumer goods market that would drive up consumer goods prices the government has imposed price controls on these goods but if you will not buy war bonds you will be tempted to spend the money in the black market we re onto you we know that privilege has long since turned into sacrifice and you are tired of so much sacrificing we are selling war bonds to re kindle the sacrifice motivation this will keep you out of the black market this will in turn lower the costs of whatever the government buys today no one in government is so naïve as to try to sell war bonds there are costs but these costs are funded by congress through taxes and the sale of conventional treasury debt instead of war bond drives the treasury sells bonds to asian central banks and american investors buyers of long term bonds are concentrated in the life insurance industry life insurance companies buy long term bonds to cover long term legal liabilities what are these liabilities to pay dollars this is not a legal liability to pay dollars of constant purchasing power just dollars trust us the government promises to pay off holders of treasury debt the government s debt has a aaa rating note so did lots of subprime mortgages the government sells its debt as a way to keep from having to raise taxes to pay for government programs who pays for these programs taxpayers and buyers of treasury debt when are these costs imposed today what has been transferred to treasury debt investors a promise to pay dollars in the future not dollars of constant purchasing power just dollars question what is the difference between a cashed social security check and crashed warplane answer the plane does not vote do present costs get transferred to future taxpayers no they are paid for by present taxpayers and investors then what do present investors receive iou s lots and lots of iou s issued by whom congress as the mogambo guru would say hahahahaha let s get this straight we are not transferring present costs to future generations we are pressuring congress to write present iou s for future repayment we are transferring present costs to present investors in iou s issued by congress as to whether any future generation decides to pay off these iou s is up to them but if you look at a chart of the iou s in relation to present tax revenues it seems a bit far fetched to imagine the future taxpayers will pay off these debts after all we aren t congress runs an official 1 8 trillion on budget annual deficit this sends a message we prefer that investors pay today s costs why should this change it will not change what will change is the willingness of investors to pay for today s costs in exchange for low interest iou s iou s of our fathers in clint eastwood s movie flags of our fathers there is a scene that stands out as one of the most illuminating scenes in the history of america s movies on world war ii the three surviving military personnel who were in the second iwo jima flag rasing photo the rigged one are stateside they are skeptical about their role as heroes they don t see that they did anything special the marines press secretary informs them that they are there to sell war bonds this seventh war bond drive was expected to fail before the flag photo captured americans hearts he did not say if we can t sell bonds to the public the federal reserve system will be the only buyer and it will have to create the money out of nothing which will produce shortages because of higher prices in the black market but that was the implication the patriotism aspect of buying bonds is long gone today the sales pitch is safety investors will get their money back the market is liquid investors can get their money back at any time yes rates are low yes the federal reserve system doubled the monetary base in 2008 to keep alive the bond market but this market is trustworthy price inflation is not a threat implied message it will never be a threat but if it ever becomes a threat you can sell your bonds and get your money back this means that the iou s of our fathers which were never paid off but were merely rolled over by selling more iou s have set the pattern the patriotism is gone the market for rolled over treasury debt is with us still when it comes to government debt the world war ii song that most closely matches the market is roll me over conclusion all costs are present costs it is only a question of who pays them and why anyone who says that we are passing on present costs to future generations does not understand economic cause and effect we are told that we are using politics to leave a massive debt to our children really which children the typical taxpayer he or she can vote as soon as this tax burden grows too heavy the voters will demand that it be reduced congress will then sell more debt just as it always does at some point that debt will not find a market the great default will then take place at that point congress s iou s will become iou nothings the great default is coming count on it _______________________ published on july 22 2009 the original is here the famous photo was the second photo the flag in the first photo was too small not considered sufficiently impressive the photographer was correct on october 2019 the marine corps admitted that one of the six men was identified incorrectly pfc rene gagnon was not one of the six cpl harold keller was the marines sent gagnon to raise war bond money three years ago it was determined that pfc harold schultz was one of the six flag raisers not navy hospital corpsman john bradley bradley was also sent home to raise money at bond drives the show must go on in recession treasury debt is desirable in your portfolio especially long term bonds in mass inflation they are not the trick is to sell the bonds when the recession has bottomed because the federal reserve s policy of monetary base inflation has become permanent

hong kong cnn business the chinese government wants to do whatever it can to protect the economy in 2020 it s got an enormous task ahead of it beijing has made clear that the world s second largest economy cannot spiral into a slump and risk mass layoffs as it tangles with rising debt cooling domestic demand and an ongoing trade war with the united states that s particularly important this year because it marks the conclusion of the government s 13th five year plan during which it promised to establish a moderately prosperous society and end poverty senior members of the communist party s politburo the seven most powerful men in china said last week that all efforts must be taken to achieve those goals in 2020 in recent weeks the government has bombarded the economy with a wave of stimulus measures from tariff reductions that could help soothe the pain from rising prices to rate cuts that could fuel more bank lending authorities are also amping up the language they re using to describe the situation china s state council last month called on local governments to go to all lengths to prevent massive job losses this year what it characterized as the country s top policy priority the chief administrative office even warned that the country could face massive unexpected incidents if unemployment balloons a euphemism in china widely understood to refer to social unrest and riots and one that is rare in public government documents in recent years the government has said it has to create 11 million new jobs annually to keep employment on track while china s official unemployment data has barely budged over the last several years hovering between 4 and 5 beijing s messaging suggests that it is unusually worried about the slowing economy and the challenges that the year could bring beijing is much more worried about social unrest than about ballooning local debt which at one point seemed to be a priority said david zweig director of transnational china consulting limited and a professor emeritus at the hong kong university of science and technology huge protests after all have for months consumed hong kong which local officials said last november would sink into its first annual recession in a decade the protests have focused on calls for greater democracy but economic factors such as the soaring cost of housing and an increasingly competitive labor market have been fueling a growing sense of dissatisfaction particularly among the city s young people social unrest might be the black swan risk facing the country zweig added using a phrase that chinese president xi jinping himself uttered last year to describe an improbable but chaotic event 2020 is going to be very difficult and mass unemployment may be the most feared problem said frank ching a china political commentator and adjunct associate professor at the hong kong university of science and technology it s not just an economic issue it could develop into a political one mass unemployment brought on by a severe economic slowdown and the failure of businesses in china could cause rising social tensions and generate greater unrest shaking the legitimacy of the chinese regime he added job hunters crowd at a job fair for university graduates at northeastern university on march 21 2019 in shenyang liaoning province of china vcg via getty images major political and business figures in china have expressed concern about the economy too late last month commerce minister zhong shan told people to tighten their belts and prepare for a tough year ahead use every penny on vital things he told dozens of top commerce officials at a policy meeting alibaba baba founder jack ma also recently acknowledged the difficult business climate in 2019 telling entrepreneurs in shanghai last month that we also have to know that it might just be the beginning a slowing economy china is expected to disclose its full year growth figures for 2019 on friday the most recent data available showed that gdp growth in the third quarter slowed to its weakest pace since 1992 the 6 growth was still within the government s target range of 6 to 6 5 for the year but the slowdown is far from over according to gao shanwen chief economist for shenzhen based research firm essence securities while gao expects china s economy to keep growing he predicts that annual gdp growth for the next decade won t exceed 5 on average in a recent research note he suggested that the country would have to work very hard to maintain a growth rate above even 4 at least two percentage points lower than what beijing is expected to set as a goal for this year during its annual meeting in march the us china trade war is responsible for a lot of the country s economic struggles but it s only part of the story debt has soared in the past decade to extremely high levels as the government and state owned companies began borrowing heavily after the 2008 global financial crisis to fund houses and infrastructure projects the buying power of chinese consumers has also taken a hit as housing and pork prices rise which could dampen spending on cars luxury goods and high end smartphones making matters worse china s once vibrant private sector is struggling the government clamped down on unregulated lending between 2017 and early 2019 during a campaign aimed at defusing rising debt risks but that made it harder for private companies to borrow money and the private sector traditionally hasn t been able to rely on substantial government support banks are lending more money to state owned enterprises in recent years which gao attributed to the pressure beijing faces to maintain social order as the economy slows it s not that the state sector is more efficient gao said it s actually the opposite but that it can help stabilize employment in the short term the pace of slowdown has eased gao wrote in his research note but in the longer run the economy is less and less efficient a wave of policy measures china s focus on the economy has been obvious particularly in recent weeks some of the government s most critical actions it has pumped tens of billions of dollars into the banking system announced plans to build more railways and airports lowered import tariffs across the board for hundreds of products and promised to open up several industries to foreign investment just earlier this month the people s bank of china tried to stimulate the economy by reducing the amount of cash banks have to keep in reserve potentially freeing up roughly 115 billion for long term lending china hasn t been ignoring the private sector either premier li keqiang recently said the government is studying how it can offer more funding support to small and micro sized firms that could include requiring the people s bank of china to cut rates for commercial lenders li has also called on chinese banks to give smaller firms more money fiscal stimulus is also in the works the country s transportation ministry recently outlined plans to spend nearly 400 billion on railway highway and waterway infrastructure the country also plans to further open its economy to foreign investment which could help provide more funding for china s growth and fuel innovation according to the commerce ministry last april for example the government said it would allow foreign companies that make commercial vehicles to control or own their chinese joint ventures starting 2020 other industries are opening up too earlier this month china s financial regulator unveiled new rules to increase the amount of access foreign banks have to the market the rules will allow them to open branches and to fully own banks in china and around the same time the government started allowing foreign companies to fully own subsidiaries in the life insurance sector that operate in mainland china similar caps on fund management or securities firms will be lifted later this year the government has also taken more direct action to stem the risk of unemployment it recently made it easier for people to move from rural areas to most chinese cities in search of work by relaxing a mandatory household registration system that could accelerate urbanization in those cities and stabilize china s property market according to analysts from research firm huaxi securities

the wall street journal reported this weekend that far from the dire consequences predicted the u s economy sailed through two turbulent years of trade war with china with barely a scratch the wall street journal farmers took a big hit importers of auto parts furniture and machinery choked down punishing tariffs investment between the world s two largest economies dropped much of the u s economy is largely unscathed by two turbulent years of trade war with china economic indicators show the biggest hit to the u s economy was a decline in agricultural exports to china but this was largely ameliorated by the trump administration s decision to divert 28 billion of income from tariffs to u s farmers perhaps most notably tariffs did not cause prices to rise according to the journal a basket of goods covered by u s tariffs showed prices rising 3 percent but these were offset by prices falling on other goods inflation overall was near or below the fed s target of 2 percent indicating that the trade war did not hurt u s consumers so who paid for tariffs for the most part it appears they were paid out of corporate profits of u s importers those corporations of course got a huge tax cut before the trade war kicked in which means after tax income was higher than it would have been research by alberto cavallo a professor at harvard university and leading expert on inflation showed the prices paid by importers for goods with tariffs jumped meaning chinese exporters didn t cut their prices or absorb tariffs through currency depreciation the burden has mostly fallen on the u s importers because a chinese exporters have not reduced their u s dollar border prices and b u s importers retailers have chosen not to pass on to the u s consumers most of the additional cost said mr cavallo who co wrote a paper on the economic impact of the tariffs with the chief economist of the international monetary fund as well as economists at the boston federal reserve and the university of chicago there likely was a cost to the u s economy from the trade war china s economic slowdown reduced imports from europe which in turn reduced european demand for u s goods and services investment in the u s both domestic and foreign slowed perhaps because the on again off again aspects of the trade war created enough uncertainty that some businesses decided to wait to see what the rules would be before buying equipment or expanding their facilities the main takeaway however is remarkable the u s fought a trade war with its largest trading partner and emerged largely unscathed the u s economy is far more resilient and less reliant on china than trump critics believed
