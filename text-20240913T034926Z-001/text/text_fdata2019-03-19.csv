international economic conditions members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that new information had been somewhat limited over the preceding month because of the government shutdown in the united states and the lunar new year holiday period across asia the global economy had grown above trend in 2018 although it had slowed in the second half of the year and the more recent data that had been received had been consistent with a continuation of slower global growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 and early 2019 particularly in the euro area and parts of asia notwithstanding the slower growth in output labour markets in the major advanced economies had remained tight and there had been ongoing signs of upward pressure on wages however this had not translated into materially higher inflation core inflation had remained around target in the united states and a few other advanced economies but had remained below target in many other economies headline inflation had generally declined because of the substantial fall in oil prices in late 2018 trade tensions had remained a continued source of uncertainty for the global outlook the delay in tariff increases previously scheduled for 1 march had generated some optimism that tensions could ease however the increases in tariffs implemented in 2018 had continued to weigh on trade between the united states and china and there had been spillover effects on some other economies notably a decline in chinese imports both to meet domestic demand and facilitate export production had been apparent in export growth in the september quarter in east asia intra regional export growth had also eased although exports from east asia to the major advanced economies had been relatively resilient and survey measures of new export orders in east asia had declined sharply to be below average early in 2019 the prospect of further tariff increases on automobile imports into the united states had received considerable media attention germany and japan were likely to be particularly affected in the major advanced economies gdp growth had diverged over 2018 the large fiscal stimulus had boosted gdp growth in the united states over 2018 to well above estimates of potential growth in consumption had been supported by strong employment growth and the pick up in wages growth investment particularly in machinery equipment and intellectual property had also contributed significantly to growth in output key surveys of us manufacturing indicated that conditions had eased in recent months by contrast growth in the euro area had eased in the second half of 2018 members observed that this slowing had been quite broadly based across countries some of the loss of momentum had come from weaker external demand particularly from china survey measures of export orders suggested that the weakness in external demand had continued into early 2019 disruptions to german automotive production related to compliance issues around emissions standards had also contributed to the weaker growth and while these were expected to be temporary they had persisted at least into january output growth in japan had picked up in the december quarter following subdued growth in the september quarter which was partly attributable to natural disasters members noted that domestic demand had held up well in japan despite weaker external demand particularly from china in china the authorities had announced a range of new fiscal easing measures and had also taken steps to ease financial conditions in recent months in response to concerns about slower growth in output in the second half of 2018 members noted that the effect of this policy easing on economic activity was difficult to determine because the chinese new year holiday had affected the timing of data releases for january and february the available data such as surveys of business conditions had pointed to subdued conditions in the manufacturing sector early in 2019 price pressures had also remained low in commodity markets the price of brent crude oil had increased since the previous meeting but remained around 25 per cent below its peak in october 2018 coking coal prices had also risen since the previous meeting reflecting disruptions to supply from queensland iron ore prices had been little changed the outlook for australian coking and thermal coal prices had become more uncertain in light of reports that there had been an increase in customs processing times for australian coal at some chinese ports and a build up of inventories domestic economic conditions members observed that labour market conditions had continued to improve despite a slowing in the momentum of output growth in the second half of 2018 members noted that the national accounts for the december quarter would be released the day after the meeting they were expected to show that gdp growth over 2018 had been a little lower than anticipated at the time of the february statement on monetary policy and were likely to confirm a markedly slower pace of growth in the second half of 2018 than in the first half business investment was expected to have increased modestly in the december quarter led by the non mining sector mining investment was expected to have declined consistent with the construction phase of the remaining liquefied natural gas projects nearing completion the abs capital expenditure capex survey had provided an updated estimate of investment intentions for 2018 19 and the first estimate for 2019 20 in the non mining sector the capex survey and other forward looking indicators pointed to modest growth in investment over 2018 19 the gradual pick up was projected to continue into 2019 20 for expenditure on buildings and structures this projection was consistent with the high level of non residential construction work yet to be done although building approvals for non residential construction had declined over preceding months members noted that activity in segments of the commercial property sector had been quite strong some of the recent strength in non mining investment had been in structures which includes investment in roads and renewable energy and this was expected to continue however the capex data suggested that there may be less expenditure on machinery equipment investment in the non mining sector in 2019 20 although members noted that these early estimates were quite uncertain members also noted some of the limitations in the coverage of the capex survey it excludes the investment intentions of a range of sectors including health and education and investment in certain types of assets such as computer software more broadly survey measures of business conditions had ticked up to be slightly above average across most states and industries in early 2019 but were lower than a year earlier the capex data were consistent with mining investment reaching a trough in 2018 19 and increasing gradually in 2019 20 as firms invest to sustain production this increase in sustaining investment was expected to support resource export volumes over the forecast period by contrast conditions in the agricultural sector were expected to remain difficult in the near term limiting rural exports from some regions rainfall in south eastern queensland had been close to the lowest on record between december and february at the same time as northern queensland had experienced flooding the available data indicated that established housing prices in sydney melbourne and perth had declined further since the beginning of 2019 although both price and non price indicators for housing were difficult to interpret during the seasonal lull in sales activity over january in sydney housing prices were 13 per cent lower than their july 2017 peak while in melbourne housing prices were 10 per cent lower than their november 2017 peak auction clearance rates in sydney and melbourne had picked up over february in perth housing prices had declined to 2006 levels although rental vacancy rates had fallen to around average and newly advertised rents had been rising members noted that the perth housing market was still adjusting to lower population growth and higher unemployment rates but that the increase in mining investment was likely to have a positive effect dwelling investment was expected to have decreased in the december quarter preliminary data suggested that investment in both new dwellings and alterations and additions had declined in the quarter members noted that the pipeline of work to be done remained large and was expected to support dwelling investment through 2019 particularly in new south wales and victoria however residential building approvals and information from the bank s liaison program pointed to a marked slowing in dwelling investment in one to two years time unless pre sales increased significantly in the following few quarters the recent weakness in sales of detached new houses had been most pronounced in sydney and melbourne but had also been evident in other locations contacts had reported that tighter access to credit for off the plan and project homes had been constraining buyer demand consumption was expected to have contributed more to growth in the december quarter than in the september quarter when consumption growth had been soft consumer sentiment had been broadly stable supported by ongoing strength in the labour market but the momentum in consumption growth had remained a key source of uncertainty given its variability over recent quarters retail sales volumes had increased by just 0 1 per cent in the december quarter and growth had eased to 1 6 per cent in year ended terms information from liaison indicated that retail conditions had softened in december because some christmas spending had been brought forward to november but had remained stable since then growth in retail sales had been particularly weak in new south wales and for large discretionary items such as household goods and furnishings members noted that sales of motor vehicles to households had also fallen over recent months some part of the slowdown in retail and motor vehicle spending in new south wales was likely to have been related to declines in housing prices and in particular lower turnover in the housing market members noted that retail sales growth had not slowed to the same extent in victoria despite similar declines in housing prices in contrast to the slowdown in gdp growth conditions in the labour market had continued to improve the national unemployment rate had been steady at 5 0 per cent in january but had fallen to around 4 per cent in trend terms in new south wales the unemployment rate in victoria had also declined to low levels while the unemployment rate in western australia had increased in recent months to be around 6½ per cent the heads based underemployment rate had declined in trend terms to be around its mid 2014 levels employment had increased by 0 3 per cent in january and by 2 2 per cent over the preceding 12 months which was well above growth in the working age population the number of full time jobs had increased strongly in january following a couple of months of small declines and employment to population ratios had increased across most age categories members noted that both outcomes were consistent with strong labour market conditions the participation rate had been stable at a high level overall leading indicators continued to suggest that employment growth was likely to remain above average although some indicators had turned down a little recently growth in the wage price index wpi had been broadly as expected in the december quarter and unchanged at 2 3 per cent over the year year ended wages growth in the private sector had picked up to its fastest pace in four years members noted that this increase was more pronounced once bonuses and commissions were included wages growth had been higher than a year earlier in most industries and states the strongest growth in wages had been in victoria at 2 7 per cent consistent with the decline in the unemployment rate as well as relatively stronger public sector wage outcomes in that state growth in the wpi in western australia had remained low at 1 6 per cent over the year western australia was the only state where year ended wages growth had remained below 2 per cent by industry wages growth had been relatively weak in the retail construction and professional scientific technical industries consistent with information from micro level wpi data that wage freezes had been more common in these industries in recent years than had been the case previously financial markets members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that global financial conditions had generally eased in prior weeks reflecting the recent moderation in market expectations for future central bank policy rates some optimism around us china trade negotiations and resilience in corporate earnings the easing in financial conditions had also been seen in australian markets members observed that overall financial conditions remained accommodative globally and in australia expectations for monetary policy in the advanced economies had been little changed over the month following the downward shift in policy expectations around the turn of the year federal open market committee fomc officials had continued to state that with the federal funds rate close to estimates of neutral they will be patient in making any changes to policy and will be closely guided by incoming data members noted however that some fomc officials had continued to indicate that us monetary policy might need to be tightened further financial market pricing indicated that the next move in the federal funds rate was expected to be down although not until late 2020 or early 2021 members noted however that this might reflect market participants views that risks had become more skewed to the downside rather than that an interest rate reduction was the most likely outcome financial market pricing continued to indicate that accommodative monetary policy was expected to be maintained in the euro area and japan for some time with central bank officials having recently noted a weakening in the outlook for economic activity and inflation in those economies in australia and new zealand financial market pricing indicated that policy rates were expected to be lowered by early 2020 following the earlier shift from expected future increases in policy rates members noted that long term bond yields in the major global markets remained below their levels late in 2018 consistent with the more subdued outlook for inflation and the lowering of expectations for future policy rates in the major advanced economies australian long term bond yields had declined further in february in line with the shift down in policy expectations following the previous meeting to be at their lowest levels since late 2016 as a result government bond yields in australia had moved further below those in the united states in china long term government bond yields had also declined over recent months in the context of the easing in financial conditions by the authorities global equity markets had rebounded over the first two months of 2019 following a sharp fall in late 2018 members observed that these swings in equity prices had been driven largely by shifting risk premiums and had been disproportionate to the changes in corporate earnings in the united states share prices were now only 4 per cent below the peak of 2018 in australia on an accumulation basis which takes account of dividend payments share price indices were back to around their 2018 peak chinese share prices had risen particularly strongly since the start of 2019 most likely reflecting optimism around us china trade negotiations and recent and expected future policy easing but had underperformed relative to other markets over the preceding year forecasts for corporate earnings in 2019 in the major markets as well as in australia had been lowered in recent months consistent with the downward revisions to the outlook for growth and inflation in several economies nevertheless some growth in earnings was still expected in australia and abroad underlying profits for listed companies in australia had been little changed in the second half of 2018 profits in parts of the resources sector had been supported by higher commodity prices while profits in sectors exposed to property had tended to decline members noted that the easing in global financial conditions had also been evident in corporate bond spreads which had declined recently and that corporate bond yields had remained close to historically low levels in china growth in total social financing had increased a little in recent months after declining steadily over the preceding year the slowing in growth in total social financing since late 2017 had reflected policy measures to reduce non bank lending activity which had been an important source of funding for private firms in order to reduce overall risks in the financial system more recently the pace of contraction in non bank lending had abated somewhat as the authorities wanted to ensure financing was readily available for smaller private firms growth in corporate bond issuance had also picked up over the preceding year members noted that the chinese authorities were continuing to balance their priorities of supporting growth while addressing financial stability risks financial conditions in other emerging markets had continued to ease after tightening over 2018 equity prices had unwound some of their earlier falls and the increase in bond spreads had also been partly retraced exchange rates of emerging market economies had stabilised and appreciated in some cases and inflows of foreign capital had resumed policy adjustments in some economies as well as the easing in global financial conditions and associated depreciation in the us dollar had contributed to the easing in financial conditions in emerging markets in foreign exchange markets members noted that the chinese renminbi had appreciated slightly since late 2018 the australian dollar had been broadly steady over preceding months and remained within the relatively narrow range of recent years turning to domestic financial markets members noted that growth in housing lending to owner occupiers had slowed to 5 per cent in six month ended annualised terms while growth in lending to investors in housing had stabilised at a rate of around 1 per cent housing loan approvals data indicated that the slowing in housing lending growth had been largely accounted for by the major banks but members noted that more recently loan approvals by other smaller lenders had also declined liaison with banks and other lenders suggested that the requirements for more thorough verification of income and expenditure data had led to an increase in loan approval times in 2018 but subsequent investments in people and technology had reduced approval times the typical time from application to approval was reported to be currently around one week it was reported that approval times for loans for house and land packages remained significantly longer closer to around one month than for loans for established property because of careful management of the greater risks involved in this form of lending overall liaison with lenders suggested that loan approval rates were little changed and that reduced demand from borrowers particularly investors largely explained the slower growth in lending nevertheless members noted that there had been some reduction in the supply of credit as lending practices had been tightened over the previous year members discussed a number of additional factors that could influence credit supply in 2019 including the melbourne institute s household expenditure measure which plays some role in lending assessments had increased by more than it had in recent years tighter lending policies on debt to income ratios and the broadening of comprehensive credit reporting which might reveal under reporting of applicants other liabilities while these factors could affect the maximum amount offered to a borrower only a small proportion of borrowers borrow up to their limits members noted that banks continued to compete for borrowers of high credit quality by offering lower interest rates on new loans than those offered on existing loans growth in business credit had remained robust with both the major banks and other lenders having contributed to the growth over the preceding year although the major banks account for a smaller share of business lending than before the onset of the global financial crisis members observed however that the growth in business lending had been entirely to large businesses with one estimate suggesting that lending to small businesses had declined slightly over the preceding year there had been greater caution around lending to small businesses in response to the royal commission into misconduct in the banking superannuation and financial services industry lower housing prices had also reduced the value of collateral for loans to small businesses members noted that interest rates in the australian short term money market had recently declined from the persistently high levels around the turn of the year in line with developments in international markets although they remained a little above their levels of earlier years members had a detailed discussion of the bank s operations in repurchase and foreign exchange swap markets and their role in achieving the board s target for the cash rate banks longer term funding costs had declined a little over recent months consistent with lower long term government bond yields even though spreads on bank bonds had increased over the preceding year overall the marginal cost of banks wholesale funding had declined a little from 2018 levels to be only slightly higher than in 2017 at the same time the major banks retail deposit rates had continued to drift down financial market pricing implied that the cash rate was expected to remain unchanged during 2019 but that a reduction in the cash rate was expected by early 2020 considerations for monetary policy in considering the stance of monetary policy members observed that growth in the global economy had been above trend in 2018 although it had slowed over the second half of the year and timely indicators suggested that this moderation had extended into 2019 nonetheless output growth had remained sufficient in most advanced economies for labour markets to remain tight putting upward pressure on wages members noted the tension in a number of economies between slower gdp growth and resilient labour markets the transmission of tighter labour market conditions to inflation pressures was taking longer than might be expected based on historical experience the authorities had responded to slowing growth in china by putting in place policies to increase the flow of credit to the private sector and easing fiscal policy in a targeted way to support growth while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector slowing growth in china and ongoing trade tensions had led to lower growth in global trade and continued to be a source of uncertainty for the outlook for global growth the tightening of global financial conditions associated with higher risk premiums required by investors around the turn of the year had eased members assessed that global financial conditions remained accommodative with financial market pricing indicating that little change to the accommodative stance of monetary policy in the advanced economies was expected over the following year or so the terms of trade for australia were expected to have remained above their trough in early 2016 and the australian dollar had remained within its narrow range of recent times domestically there continued to be tension between the ongoing improvement in labour market data and the apparent slowing in the momentum of output growth in the second half of 2018 leading indicators of conditions in the labour market such as vacancies and hiring intentions pointed to further tightening in the labour market in the near term private sector wages growth had picked up further in the december quarter consistent with the bank s forecasts and survey evidence that a significant share of firms were finding it difficult to attract suitable labour although output growth had slowed in the second half of 2018 the outlook for business investment and spending on public infrastructure had remained positive growth in consumption was expected to be supported by an increase in growth in household disposable income however there continued to be considerable uncertainty around the outlook for consumption given the environment of declining housing prices in some cities low growth in household income and high debt levels dwelling investment was expected to subtract from growth in output over the forecast period and unless pre sales volumes started to increase this decline could be sharper than currently expected the process of adjustment in the housing market had continued housing prices in sydney melbourne and perth had declined further and turnover in the housing market had fallen significantly rent inflation had remained low across most of the country despite declines in rental vacancy rates over the previous year except in sydney where rental vacancy rates had been increasing credit conditions had tightened for some borrowers and the demand for housing credit had slowed noticeably as conditions in the housing market had changed mortgage rates had remained low and there was strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been supporting economic activity and had allowed for gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target while the labour market had continued to strengthen less progress had been made on inflation looking forward the central forecast scenario was still for growth in gdp of around 3 per cent over 2019 and a further decline in the unemployment rate to 4¾ per cent over the next couple of years this further reduction in spare capacity underpinned the forecast of a gradual pick up in wage pressures and inflation given this members agreed that developments in the labour market were particularly important taking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions and how they were expected to evolve members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy was supporting jobs growth and a gradual lift in inflation however members noted that significant uncertainties around the forecasts remained with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate the probabilities around these scenarios were more evenly balanced than they had been over the preceding year members agreed to continue to assess the outlook carefully given that further progress in reducing unemployment and lifting inflation was a reasonable expectation members agreed that there was not a strong case for a near term adjustment in monetary policy rather they assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady while new information became available that could help resolve the current tensions in the domestic economic data members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would enable the bank to be a source of stability and confidence and would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time the decision the board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1 5 per cent to read the original minutes click here

what has been known as conservatism in the republican party since ronald reagan left office fully thirty years ago has become inadequate this has been evident for a while though we re only now noticing from the great recession and loss of manufacturing jobs to perpetual war in the islamic world and intensifying culture war at home conservatism as the gop understood it over the last few decades was not only not the answer to our woes but was in many cases their cause thus our present moment post reagan conservative intellectuals soldier on in think tanks and on opinion pages but conservative voters are abandoning the cause donald trump s program when he arrived on the national scene four years ago was in almost every respect the opposite of conservative orthodoxy on trade on the iraq war on the need to apologize for politically incorrect utterances and sometimes worse yet republican voters preferred trump over the paragons of every major conservative faction in the 2016 primaries the latest establishment bush the neocon of the future marco rubio the libertarian rand paul ted cruz the movement conservative s conservative and every other flavor those who claimed that trump only won because the field was so divided overlooked the obvious if post reagan conservatism was satisfactory there should have been a plurality for any one of its champions not for the candidate who campaigned like a nixon republican so now conservatism is in flux there are those who still insist on the old formulas there is the trump administration with its inevitably imperfect implementation of his campaign agenda there are trump imitators mostly unsuccessful so far and there are a great many politicians and policy minds attempting to combine something of trump with a traditional post reagan republican program which way is a conservative to choose with eyes on the good of the country not just on the success of a faction we need a conservative agenda fit for the twenty first century and the closest thing to it is in fact the program that follows through on the themes of trump s 2016 campaign with greater clarity and focus than the administration itself has so far done this is not because trump now defines conservatism as his detractors allege when they complain about a cult of personality trump has no more of a cult than his last two predecessors did and less of one among professional conservatives than the deified reagan rather trump in 2016 whether consciously or not drew upon what has been the clear policy alternative to the elite consensus in favor of global liberalism since the early 1990s economic nationalism and nationalism more generally this is an honorable tradition whose roots in the republican party run all the way back to abraham lincoln so successful was the economic nationalism pursued by america in the twentieth century that we could afford to deviate from it during the cold war for the sake of strengthening allies like west germany japan and south korea and even communist china an ally of convenience against the soviet union but when the cold war ended our economic policy no less than our foreign policy should have taken a turn back toward the national interest over building a liberal world order trump s essential appeal to voters was his promise to do just that he is not an aberration he is not even a second more successful pat buchanan he is a return in however haphazard a fashion to the policy orientation that once really did make america great and the gop grand economic nationalism is not just about tariffs it is less about economic than it is about nationalism that is it takes account of the different needs of different walks of life and regions of the country serving the whole by serving its parts and drawing them together in the past the challenge was to harmonize farmers urban capital and labor the challenge now is to balance those groups with the post industrial classes as well and to strengthen the productive economy against the largely fictional economy of administrators and clerks all of this is for the sake not just of prosperity in raw dollar terms but of a national economy that provides the basis for a healthy culture in which citizens and their families can flourish culture comes first but like a final cause or end in aristotle s philosophy it is first in priority not necessarily first in time or action we need to bring this truth forward for we ve forgotten it over the past few decades conservatives have long believed that politics is downstream from culture as andrew breitbart liked to say variations on the idea go back at least as far as irving babbitt who was a rare conservative on the faculty of harvard college even in 1924 when he wrote that the economic problem will be found to run into the political problem the political problem in turn into the philosophical problem and the philosophical problem itself to be almost indissolubly bound up at last with the religious problem babbitt meant that the class conflict of the nineteenth century still very much alive in his day was symptomatic of something deeper breitbart in turn meant that the cultural contexts created by news and entertainment media by the storylines they script and the emotional cues embedded within them largely define the limits of the possible in politics these two views combine in the conviction that culture in both the social and spiritual senses takes precedence over politics or economics as important as that truth is it is easily misapplied in practice it has meant that conservatives emphasize certain cultural forms of argument without seriously confronting the hard questions of politics or economics as if worldly matters will take care of themselves if only our rhetoric is elevated and our intentions pure sometimes this leads to a politics of cant sometimes it leads to political quietism or a drift toward literary utopianism and sometimes it just leads to ham fisted attempts to produce conservative films or other forms of popular culture in which the political message is almost always more conspicuous than the artistic merit cultural philosophical and religious assumptions suffuse public life and in that sense politics is indeed downstream from culture one can even go further and say that culture broadly understood is the riverbed of politics setting the course along which it flows but that course is checked and channeled by willful human activity by building dams and canals as it were how this is done turns largely on economic questions or rather questions of what used to be called political economy different kinds of political economy not only produce different dispensations of wealth and power but also profoundly shape family life individual character and the civic landscape a political program therefore has to be an economic program not just in the superficial sense of dealing with subjects like taxes and regulation but in the deeper sense of relating the nation s economic way of life to its cultural fabric and the very conditions of its existence the underlying structure of american life should not be questioned at every election but it does need to be considered anew when dramatic changes have taken place in the world or at home our present predicament is the result of letting political thought run on autopilot for too long donald trump s rise and the rise today of an invigorated socialism in the democratic party are signs that conventional politics had failed because conventional politics was built upon an economic order that has ended without its advocates even realizing it there are times in a nation s life when the terms of its politics are settled rival parties might disagree about how to achieve certain goals winning the cold war increasing gdp reducing crime but they agree on the overall story of politics and frame their proposals in light of it republicans and democrats shared a story throughout the latter half of the twentieth century and into the twenty first just as britain s conservatives and liberals shared a story in the latter half of the nineteenth century benjamin disraeli never brought back the corn laws just as william gladstone never contemplated disestablishing the church of england or abolishing the monarchy ronald reagan said he wanted to conserve the new deal while bill clinton after losing a bruising battle over national healthcare decided to go no further and announced that the era of big government is over in foreign policy both republicans and democrats still talk about american leadership even in cultural politics stark differences in policy can be framed within the same narrative abortion is usually about individual rights for example whether a woman s or the unborn s for many conservatives the alternative to accepting same sex marriage a decade ago was to propose domestic partnerships for same sex couples the details matter and they can be matters of life or death but even the gravest questions can often be addressed within a shared idiom yet there are times when a nation faces a fundamental choice about its nature and direction the choice between an agrarian and aristocratic or a commercial and bourgeois political order confronted both britain and france in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries americans too had to choose between agrarian ideals belied by the reality of slavery and industrial development at several points between the constitution s ratification and the outbreak of the civil war in the early twentieth century the relevant choice was between unreconciled class struggle of the sort that had been going on for nearly a hundred years or the imposition of a new settlement upon labor and capital alike the mixed economy america is now at another moment of choice the class compact that came out of the great depression and world war ii stabilized many of the social tensions dating back to the very beginnings of industrialization it has broken down the welfare state is heading toward bankruptcy americans are increasingly working as contractors rather than salaried employees with fewer benefits and less security industrial jobs are vanishing a family wage lifelong work retirement guarantees and brighter prospects for one s children and grandchildren are not part of the bargain anymore economic growth is concentrated in cities and college towns leaving everyplace else to wither if the country continues on its present course all of this will get worse until 2016 however both major parties continued to campaign as if the class compact of the twen tieth century still held sway conservative republican policy ideas were limited to keeping federal spending in check in theory if never in practice and cutting taxes and regulations while looking for novel ways to continue providing the benefits americans had come to expect by privatizing social security for example or mandating the purchase of private health insurance mitt romney s idea before it became obama s progressive democrats simply planned to have the federal government spend more to keep the welfare state expanding indefinitely though just as republicans could spend as freely as democrats democrats experimented with republican solutions for making the welfare state more affordable or acceptable to business obamacare was one result these policies whether right or left can no more save the class compact of the twentieth century than farm subsidies could save the agrarian ideal they may or may not be totally useless in their own right but they are beside the main point the american economy has changed in ways that require a new choice about the kind of country we are up to now the choice has been made by default leaders in both parties in corporate america and in the academy and media have assumed that what worked twenty or thirty years ago will continue to work today the reigning assumption has been that politics should focus on fine tuning the private and public sectors to provide the growth opportunity and security americans have come to rely upon a tax cut or a new entitlement is all we need but the america of the twentieth century was a country in several ways profoundly different from the one we inhabit today it had strong community ties supplied by religious and ethnic groups it had a powerful private sector labor movement its economy was localized not globalized where an industry was located mattered america exported goods to the world enjoying a trade surplus as late as 1975 and manufacturing was at the heart of the economy though it was never the largest employer in europe the class bargains that tamed the strife between labor and capital characteristic of the nineteenth century put primary emphasis on the welfare state but in america the welfare state was secondary more important was the reigning political economy s promise of a vigorous private sector that would provide prosperity and continuous flourishing for all by the late 1970s the postwar economic order was under obvious strain stagflation was one symptom lagging american competitiveness against the allies we had rebuilt was another the liberalization of the economy that started with conservatives in congress under president carter and expanded under president reagan was necessary to restore the postwar promise and it worked in part by unleashing technological innovation that would be more creative than destructive over the next decade the 1970s and 80s also saw the creation or expansion of international institutions that were viewed at the time if not always explicitly acknowledged as instruments of cold war policy everything from the acceptance of china into the american led world economy to the construction of a european union was part of a strategy aimed at constraining the soviet union in the long run only the long run proved to be much shorter than anyone expected by 1992 the strategic environment was totally transformed yet america s leaders did not think through the implications free trade agreements that made sense as a component of cold war strategy took on a logic of their own with plenty of support from academic economists who dreamed of nothing but global efficiency instead of viewing post cold war china as a rising rival america s elites saw the remaining communist superpower as a land of opportunity for themselves the original rationale for america to pursue a global economic order had vanished yet instead of once again focusing on the economic interests of america s workers the country s leaders committed themselves to universal liberalism the result was a political backlash the pat buchanan and ross perot campaigns of 1992 and 1996 featured pitched battles in congress over most favored nation status for china and street protests against the world trade organization in 1999 the battle of seattle but the backlash was undercut by a decade s worth of technology driven prosperity and rather than conceding that the critics had a point the consensus in washington pushed ever further ahead that led to a plunge in american industrial employment after 2000 as china was fully welcomed into the world economy members of the credentialed class like to depict trump s voters as nostalgic for an america that is never coming back if anything it is our leadership that is nostalgic for the 1990s and deep in denial globalization was relatively pain free during the 1990s because going into that decade americans did not know what would happen next the class compact of the past defined the public s outlook and expectations more than the unknown future now the future without a class compact is clear to everyone even if many in the leadership class are reluctant to describe it in frank terms it means an america broken into three relatively immobile classes a credentialed and knowledge based elite a large service class that prepares the first s food and tends to its children also the class of the urban uber driver and suburban amazon warehouse worker and a vast economically unneeded population in what used to be the commercial and industrial heartland in their presidential campaigns barack obama mitt romney and hillary clinton all provided insight into how the elite views those they consider part of the unproductive class as bitter clingers as a parasitical 47 percent who are not job creators and as moral deplorables they are simply unnecessary to the next stage of economic and cultural liberalism they want wages that are too high and career prospects to which they are not entitled their expectations are too great in contrast to those of immigrants whose prospects only brighten if they come to the u s from the developing world the bipartisan elite s policy program for the near future amounts to shoring up its own privileges with respect to intellectual property and bureaucratic know how while fragmenting and buying off the urban service class with identity politics for the unproductives the elite prescribes what might be called palliative liberalism involving wage subsidies tax credits and other measures short of restoring inherent dignity and power to work palliative liberalism is not the same thing as the old welfare liberalism the welfare state of the twentieth century was at least in america meant to be only an adjunct to a productive private economy in which almost all could participate palliative liberalism on the other hand aims not to repair labor capital relations but to euthanize as humanely as possible millions of economically unneeded and politically retrograde americans the justice of this euthanasia is said to be found in the laws of nature and the arc of history the only nature that the prescribers of palliative liberalism recognize is the natural order of economics whereby creative destruction applies not only to firms but to families nations and individuals for the good of all the inefficient must give way to the more productive only selfishness and ignorance can account for the resistance of privileged or formerly privileged working class or middle class americans to this natural process they unlike the entrepreneurial worthies of wall street and silicon valley are not deserving of their status they don t create value and should in effect trade places with the poor of the developing world this is what being on the right side of history requires the injustices of christopher columbus and jim crow will be repaid by the desolation of america s red counties during the earlier class war phase of the modern economy in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries religion moderated the harshness of the struggle as did extended family and to some degree national sentiment the rich felt obliged to be locally charitable not just abstractly philanthropic and civil society provided means for self help the irony is that the success of the twentieth century s grand bargain the welfare state and the middle class growth economy weakened family and religion providing individuals unprecedented freedoms that with the collapse of the bargain have turned into unprecedented loneliness the relief that church and family once provided is now supplied by fentanyl another low priced consumer product from china what factories remain in the emerging america will be ever more automated while the american workforce will be further channeled into the service sector that sector has two tiers some people will engage in physical service work and others will specialize in verbal and financial smarts but even the high status individuals of the latter group will in most cases be administrators and bureaucrats not creators of new things but disentanglers of rules as well as the sources of such entangling rules in the first place the administrative class specializes in making itself seem essential to technological prosperity as if facebook etiquette monitors or corporate diversity officers are as important as the programmers they are after all notionally just as highly educated they went to the same schools as the software engineers and for just as long yet even the winners in post industrial america may find themselves poorer than their paychecks would suggest as urban professionals income has risen the cost of the essential accoutrements of their status has risen as well you can t be a professional without an education and a year of college now costs as much as lower tier professionals earn in a year a credentialed class winner who wants to have a semblance of professional community including all important networking opportunities has to live in a city where real estate prices are sky high some defenders of the emerging economy say that the decline of the middle class is nothing to worry about because it means more americans have moved into upper income brackets but the costs of moving into the higher class are staggering quite commensurate in many cases with the higher pay and not too far into the future the technological redundancy that has struck the middle class will eliminate a good many financial legal and administrative jobs as well unlike factory workers however lawyers and bureaucrats will have the political means to minimize the harm they suffer just consider the different attitudes of our present elite toward protecting intellectual property against china and protecting manufacturing jobs in some senses the lower rung of the new urban service economy suggests a regression to the service economy of the aristocratic manor there are jobs to be had as nannies or as dog walkers there are jobs to be had serving meals in restaurants or chauffeuring the wealthier around these are not jobs that easily allow one to start a family or to retire in comfort they also are not jobs that lend themselves to political organizing instead race and lifestyle become the grounds for organization they are poor substitutes for economic interest the ties they create are looser the issues they involve often more abstract and insoluble the real economy the productive industrial economy is unavoidably local metals have to be mined where they re found factories are located where transportation is easiest which is partly a function of nature waterways and partly design highways and railways with large concentrations of workers in particular industries living in particular places workers can be organized formally or otherwise into political blocs to apply pressure to elected officials in support of their economic interests this geographic proximity and common economic interest as well as a shared way of life related to work once bound together communities the resulting america of the second half of the twentieth century was different from tocqueville s america or thomas jefferson s yeoman dream neither man would have appreciated the welfare state and the lack of independent means characteristic of the employee citizen nevertheless that america was knitted together and worked palliative liberalism and the rest of the political program of today s leadership class hold little promise of keeping the country together whatever else it tries to do an elite has to manage discontent the rise of socialism and nationalism in american politics shows that already the effort is failing the best case scenario for the liberal elite is daunting to contemplate their interests economic and cultural are well served by a completely atomized america one in which states have not seceded but individuals have a heap of loose economic actors who have lost their cultural bearings allows itself to be managed benignly if contemptibly by the wealthy and educated the more likely scenarios however involve upheaval in the name of socialism or something like military imposed order look to latin america for the past as preview there is a better way the most effective and honorable way out of the dilemma we face is to embrace something like nationalism as an economic program at the end of the eighteenth century the french ancien régime paid the ultimate price for failing to mend its ways had nineteenth century britain not adjusted the balance of power and interests between landed lords commercial magnates and the growing urban working class a similar fate would have awaited it america s fundamental political choice now is between mild nationalism resurgent socialism or suicide by liberalism whether of the libertarian or palliative sort that being the case how would the nationalist alternative work it would begin by rejecting propaganda about the end of the export economy world population is still growing and growing wealthier which means there are more people around the world increasingly capable of buying goods made in america we sacrificed some of our competitive advantage after world war ii for the sake of cold war strategy and we were right to do so but now the time has come to compete to the utmost at once politically and economically with our rivals above all china that means driving bargains to open markets for our goods while permitting access to our markets still the most desirable in the world on terms favorable to our citizens in full in their capacity as producers not just as consumers the argument that the loss of manufacturing jobs to technology excuses the extinction of manufacturing employment is not an argument at all what follows is that we ought to minimize the loss of employment due to every factor not technologically inevitable such as ill conceived trade deals tariffs are not an end in themselves of course they are a defensive measure and a source of leverage president trump s instincts are correct about immigration as well it is in need of reform that puts citizens first with emphasis on supporting higher wages for workers less low skill immigration puts upward pressure on wages and what if there just aren t enough american workers to fill all the jobs that s good too because other things being equal it encourages larger family size when parents see opportunities for their children in a world in which more labor is needed they have confidence to have more children this is why populations everywhere boom at the onset of an industrial revolution and it s a reason why frontier settler populations so often have such high rates of family formation get employment growing again for americans who are not already on the top of the heap and their families can grow again too there s an argument to be made for shifting policy preference from low skill immigration to high skill immigration not only so that the country receives more economic value per immigrant but also to put competitive pressure on the professional elite the more the elite feels the same pressures as the working class from technology and immigration the more its attitude toward patriotism may improve naturalization of high skilled immigrants is preferable to the present h 1b visa program which favors employers over native and immigrant workers alike by putting downward wage pressure on natives and making temporary immigrants effectively indentured to their employers the idea that economic nationalism is not compatible with free market economics is absurd the history of america from the founding to the new deal belies the idea that nationalist economics is bad for business or growth its virtue is that it is good for labor and political stability as well from growth a contented middle class and moderate political culture flow a strong country and stronger families and citizens in the early decades of the twenty first century when nations and supranational institutions are in turmoil those benefits are of existential significance the ideal of jefferson s agrarian america as distinct from its too often plantation based reality was a nation of virtuous yeomanry small independent farmers capable of providing for their families themselves abraham lincoln s vision was of a country in which working men not only farmers could improve their standards of life in the twentieth century the american dream became a thing to which every salaryman could aspire a good job enough money to buy a house start a family and retire and the chance to watch one s children rise to a higher station in the twenty first century that dream has given way to delirium feverish uncertainty about whether in midlife one will have to become an amazon deliveryman or a walmart greeter and anxiety about whether one s children will be tech company winners or endlessly indebted gig workers we need to accept the responsibilities of leadership that means governing in the century in which we actually live rather than the one shaped by our political heroes after the fall of the soviet union the world began to change and our country with it those changes have accelerated and are now threatening to tear us apart the way forward requires refocusing on the american citizen as the basic unit of the economy this is the essence of a nationalist political economy which we very much need if our country s tradition of personal independence and limited government is to endure a tradition in which government s primary economic role is not to provide welfare but to safeguard the conditions that make productive work possible daniel mccarthy is editor of modern age a conservative review photo by alex proimos via creative commons image

business news of tuesday 19 march 2019 source goldstreetbusiness com as widely expected by financial markets analysts currency trading speculators are increasingly taking trading positions against the cedi in an effort to reap quick profits from the national currency s ongoing sharp depreciation despite the unexpected rebound of the cedi towards the end of last week the currency gained some three percent against the united states dollar on thursday taking the local foreign exchange market by surprise investors who took up dollar positions at the start of 2019 are still better off now that their counterparts who invested in any other type of financial instrument at the time even with last week s surprise appreciation the cedi had lost 4 7 percent against the dollar by the end of the week since the beginning of this year the ghana stock exchange composite index has declined by 4 58 percent while its financial index has fallen by 0 33 percent this puts the returns on dollar holdings well ahead of weighted average returns on a portfolio of listed equities similarly annualized yields on government treasury securities currently range between 14 71 percent for 91 day treasury bills and about 21 percent for seven year treasury bonds these fall well short of the current annualized returns of 24 5 percent on dollar holdings derived currently from the cedi s depreciation even corporate bonds such as the medium term notes issued by afb ghana and traded on the ghana alternative stock exchange gax currently offer yields of between 22 and 24 percent do not quite match the yields accruing to currency speculators indeed until the cedi s sudden partial recovery during the last two days of last week annualized yields for dollar holdings was some 40 percent currency speculators are consequently investing in dollar holdings and to a much lesser extent other major international trading currencies particularly euros unfortunately such speculative trading is self fulfilling in that it accelerates the depreciation which thus justifies the investment in currencies in the first place fully aware of the threat this poses to the cedi exchange rate and consequently inflation the bank of ghana is taking steps to curtail speculative demand for forex even as it collaborates with government itself to increase both gross international reserves and supply of foreign currencies on the local forex market both of which aim to bolster confidence in the cedi going forward and thus stem rising bid prices in late february the bog issued a new directive aimed at tightening reporting requirements for forex trading and tightening trading margins the first seeks to prevent trading for sheer speculative purposes and the other seeks to reduce the profitability of forex trading merely for profit the central bank is also seeking to increase its foreign reserves by us 850 million to enhance confidence on the local forex market and to enable more direct market intervention in the form of enhanced supply of forex on the market to prop up the exchange rate government itself is scrambling to imminently issue up to us 3 billion in eurobonds it has also negotiated a us 750 million short term loan from two international banks to give the local forex market immediate enhanced liquidity ahead of the eurobond issuance which will provide the monies to amortize the syndicated bridging finance facility government is also looking to draw down the us 300 million minor cocoa crop season component of this season s annual cocoa receivables backed syndicated loan as well as the us 647 million first tranche of the us 2 billion bauxite backed infrastructure development facility negotiated with china s sinohydro corporation add to all these the final us 200 million tranche of the us 918 million in balance of payments support being received from the international monetary fund both government and bog officials privately admit that their sense of urgency in propping up the local forex market is heightened further by the fear of increased speculative trading in 2014 and 2015 speculative trading was a major factor behind the cedi s sharp depreciation of some 30 percent in the first half of each of those two years although in each year the cedi clawed back much of its lost value during the second half of the year as forex traders sold dollars to take profits the situation this year though is different for two opposing reasons on the upside ghana has since late 2016 been making sustained trade surpluses brought about largely by increased oil exports and reduced petroleum imports much of the light crude oil imported for power generation having been replaced by locally sourced natural gas this has given the cedi more fundamental economic strength than the last time speculation by currency traders fueled cedi depreciation on the downside however ghana is now suffering severe net outflows from its capital and financial account because of dis investment by foreign portfolio investors in government s debt securities the previous period of speculative trading driven cedi depreciation was ameliorated by the net portfolio investment inflows being enjoyed by ghana at the time

party owners and operators of our assets or our assessment thereof 5 year outlook our outlook to 2023 assumes that the cobre panama project will have reached its initial 85 million tonnes per year mill throughput capacity before 2023 with no additional expansion using the same commodity price assumptions as were used for our 2019 guidance see above and assuming no other acquisitions franco

140 000 175 000 tonnes of contained copper in 2019 the agreement which indexes precious metal deliveries off the copper in concentrate shipped would equate the midpoint of 2019 production to 59 000 geos due to franco nevada there will be a delay in timing of revenue recognition from the production schedule noted above particularly in 2019 due to shipping schedules and timing of payment for concentrates as a result franco nevada expects deliveries to be between 20 000 to 40 000 geos in 2019 candelaria gold and silver stream geos earned from candelaria were lower due to the temporary processing of lower grade materials as well as a delay in year end deliveries processing of higher grade ore is expected to resume later in 2019 antapaccay gold and silver stream antapaccay had a good

and chief executive officer thank you katie good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on today s call i will review the progress we have made on executing on our global growth strategy including our recently announced strategic partnerships and acquisitions and provide an update on our opportunities for long term growth in the global medical and adult use cannabis markets mark will then review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results in more detail and discuss our long term financial targets after that we will open up the call for your questions we are still in the early stages of the global transformation of 150 billion worldwide industry we believe that over the long term companies such as tilray with a portfolio of trusted brands powered by multinational supply chains who win the market by earning the confidence of patients consumers and governments around the world taking advantage of tilray s best in class global platform our team continues to focus on being a leader in defining the future of the industry and delivering on the potential we see to be a multi billion dollar consumer packaged goods company focusing on our full year results we are pleased with our growth and momentum revenue increased by 110 year over year to 43 1 million in total the kilogram equivalents sold increased both sequentially and on a year over year basis we achieved this growth despite supply chain constraints across canada that have created pricing pressure for cannabis that meets our quality standards forcing us to source from other suppliers over the next 18 months we believe there will be oversupply just as we have seen in certain us states as operators in new legal markets race and government regulators catch up to find an equilibrium between supply and demand to capitalize on global growth opportunities on both medical and adult use cannabis tilray will deploy capital in most promising markets where we see the greatest potential to pursue multiple paths to grow the united states and european markets are orders of magnitude larger than canada so while canada will continue to be an important market for us we expect to focus the majority of future investments on the us and europe we will not purchase or invest in what we believe to be overpriced supply assets in canada which we believe will erode in value in the medium to long term as the market normalizes as we have communicated previously our global growth strategy remains focused on six top line performance drivers that we expect to generate strong returns as the business continues to grow first increase our production capacity and inventory to serve the rapidly growing global market second maintain a rigorous focus on quality as we scale third partner with established distributors and retailers to scale distribution of our products further and faster fourth for the differentiated portfolio brands and products that appeal to a diverse set of patients and consumers fifth expand the addressable medical market by fostering mainstream acceptance with the medical community and governments and finally six pioneer the future of our industry by investing in innovation research and development in clinical research in line with this strategy our recent strategic partnerships include a global alliance with sandoz a division of novartis one of the world s leading pharmaceutical companies our original agreement was focused on canada and this new global deal legitimizes medical cannabis on a global scale and increases access for patients in need across the world in the next year we anticipate distributing medical cannabis to at least a half a dozen more countries globally through this partnership with sandoz we also formed a strategic partnership with ab inbev to research non alcohol beverages containing thc and cbd the 50 50 joint venture combined ab inbev s deep experience and beverages with our expertise in cannabis products and each company intends to invest up to 50 million for a total of up to 100 million we re pleased to report that we have appointed a ceo for the jv and our leveraging the research that tilray has already performed for duration and time the onset on beverages our revenue sharing agreement with authentic brands group abg is a long term partnership designed to leverage abg s portfolio of more than 50 of the world s most iconic brands as well as their extensive distribution network across north america the partnership will initially focus on cbd products in the united states and thc and cbd products in canada and we will expand globally as regulations permit the branding opportunities in the us and europe around the retail and otc consumer products are far more interesting than the branding opportunity today in canada due to packaging and branding restrictions additionally when we look at net new consumers at cbd and thc distributors and retailers mark relationships with brands that they already know and trust which is why we re so excited to partner with abg strategic mergers and acquisitions remain a core focus of our global growth strategy last month we closed the acquisition of manitoba harvest the world s largest hemp natural foods producer for approximately 317 million manitoba harvest has nearly cad100 million in gross revenues distributes its products to more than 16 000 retail locations in the us and canada and is the leading hemp foods company with seed to shelf capabilities maintaining control over quality production manufacturing marketing and distribution of its products the acquisition of manitoba harvest is tilray access to relationships with farmers who plant more than 30 000 acres of hemp as well as some of the largest distributors in retailers across canada and the us we look forward to distributing hemp derived cbd products across north america under the manitoba harvest brand as well as other brands by leveraging manitoba harvest s established supply chain going forward we also recently acquired natura naturals holdings inc a federally licensed cannabis cultivation company based in leamington ontario for approximately cad70 million the increased supply from natura which we have rebranded as high park gardens will allow us to further expand our market share in the canadian adult use market with high quality branded cannabis products finally in december we invested cad7 5 million in rose life sciences a quebec based cannabis producer and have an exclusive sale supply distribution and marketing agreement to deliver adult use products under our portfolio of brands in quebec we believe our recent strategic global partnerships and acquisitions demonstrate our emphasis on the diversification of our global opportunities for long term growth and our disruption of critical industries as we expand our addressable market our team remains disciplined in our approach making key strategic investments to support the sustainable growth we expect to achieve over the next several years last week we announced that andrew pucher has joined us as our chief corporate development officer overseeing m a and corporate investments andrew previously served as the managing director at goldman sachs where he most recently covered the canadian cannabis industry we are excited about the contributions he will make as we accelerate our growth going forward we will continue to pursue strategic m a that opens new territories increases our capacity increases our brand offerings through innovative farm factors brings us r d technologies and we expect this selectively invest in retail distribution as i said earlier our increased focus on the us and europe among other international markets is tied to the fact that we believe they represent a significantly larger opportunity for tilray long term where we can extend beyond our potential in canada simply put we are building a company for the long term we believe that the field of battle has changed and that the us and europe are going to be more important over the long term in the us tilray is building a portfolio of brands and products with the goal of making them industry leaders in every market where cannabis is legal i believe we are a lot closer to federal legalization in the us than most people realize the farm bill presents an excellent opportunity for tilray to capitalize on an estimated us 22 billion hemp derived cbd industry in the us we have us cbd supply chain in place through the acquisition of manitoba harvest in a deal to produce hemp derived cbd infused products for authentic brands group as regulations permit we have also finalized the cbd supply agreement to source cbd from livewell canada and the united states for wellness and medical tilray branded cbd products across north america we expect livewell to begin shipping product to us during the second quarter of 2019 in the coming months we expect to make additional announcements about strategic investments and partnerships in the us to position tilray for long term leadership in the market focusing on europe just last month the european parliament passed a resolution similar to the world health organization s recommendation to increase access to medical cannabis further legitimizing the industry and we believe this decision will encourage other states and countries to legalize we began 2018 with 28 countries having legalized medical use globally and ended the year with 41 and we can easily see how that number grows to 50 or 60 by the end of 2019 our eu campus in portugal completed a successful medical harvest earlier this month and we are well positioned to serve the eu market as more countries legalize we expect the eu campus to produce and distribute cannabis in the eu for the eu and believe that having a local vertically integrated supply chain presence is an important differentiator for us to reduce costs and hedge against regulatory risk our campus includes indoor outdoor and greenhouse cultivation sites as well as research labs processing packaging and distribution sites for medical products this first harvest was a significant milestone for the company and we expect multiple harvests in the coming months by the end of 2019 we expect to increase our production space to 2 2 million square feet approximately double compared to the end of 2018 on our existing properties we have the ability to expand our total production space to 4 5 million square feet our seven production facilities around the world are significantly increasing our global production output compared to 2018 while the canadian market remains challenged with quality supply we are confident the supply demand will become more balanced over time as additional supply becomes available longer term we do not believe tilray will be in the farming business so we re not allowing the near term supply disruption to change our strategy for growth over the next two years from a retail perspective we ve have taken small steps in canada including minority investments in fire flower inner spirit and westleaf and expect to invest more aggressively in the months to come to aiding our global expansion we have formed an international advisory board to provide strategic perspective to our executive team and board of directors the advisory board consists of 10 internationally renowned business and government leaders who continue to provide us with strategic insights as we pioneer the future of our industry as mentioned earlier we have also expanded our global senior leadership team with six strategic executive hires from world class organizations to help our existing teams spearhead our future growth and development internationally in addition to andrew pucher as our new chief corporate development officer from goldman sachs we hired greg christopher who joined from nestle to be our executive vice president of operations rita seguin joined from diageo as executive vice president of human resources dara redler our general counsel joined from coca cola charlie cain our vice president of retail joined from starbucks and sascha mielcarek our managing director europe joined us from grunenthal at the same time our team remains deeply committed to clinical research this is important for the future of medicine as well as being a competitive differentiator in the industry and has accelerated awareness very positive awareness in international medical cannabis market most recently in the fourth quarter we partnered with researchers at the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics at the university to sydney to complete a study examining the effects of cannabis on driving and cognitive function the trial phase of the study culminated in 2018 and results are expected to be published sometime this year looking ahead to the balance of the year and into 2020 we continue to anticipate the following corporate milestones launching tilray and manitoba harvest cbd products in the us as regulations permit signing additional adult use supply agreements in canada shipping tilray products to pharmacy chains in canada exporting tilray medical products to new countries expanding tilray s medical cannabis product offerings in the international markets we currently serve extending our existing pharmaceutical partnerships to additional countries and regions obtaining a sales license for high park s processing facility in london ontario additional clinical trials recruiting additional executives from outside of the industry to further strengthen our management team and finally adding strategic partnerships and acquisitions in the united states and europe in summary we are incredibly proud of our achievements in 2018 and are excited about our growth potential over the next several years we will continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and take actions that will fuel long term value for our shareholders as well as our customers consumers patients and employees around the world with that i would like to turn the call over to mark mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer thanks brendan good afternoon to those of you joining us on the today s call and webcast it is a pleasure to be speaking with you today please note all the financial information we discussed today is prepared in accordance with us gaap that is in us dollars unless otherwise indicated we are pleased to report the fourth quarter financial results and the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead focusing on fourth quarter results in more detail q4 revenue was 15 5 million representing an increase of 204 as compared to the fourth quarter last year revenue growth is driven by the inaugural sales for the canadian adult use market bulk sales and accelerated wholesale distribution in export markets extract products represented a greater mix at approximately 54 of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 24 of revenue for the same period last year we are pleased with the performance in adult use market so far and expect adult use to be a growth driver for 2019 as we continue to ramp up supply and with additional form factors that are expected to be included in our results later this year moving on to operational metrics total kilogram equivalents sold increased more than threefold to 2053 kilograms from 694 kg in the same quarter of 2017 the overall average net selling price per gram increased to 7 52 from 7 13 in the prior year the increase is primarily due to an increase in mix of higher priced extract products with improved price per gram as a percentage of total revenue compared to the prior year looking at the canadian direct to patient sales our average selling price per gram increase 9 4 to 7 43 compared to 6 79 per gram again primarily due to product mix drilling into adult use our average and selling price per gram was 5 40 per gram which we expect to increase over the longer term as higher price value added products become available in q4 on the production side we continue to expect significant increase throughout 2019 as we expand our capacity to 90 metric tonnes as we bring our ontario greenhouse and portugal facilities fully online as brendan mentioned we ve recently completed successful harvest at our eu campus in portugal and has a multiple harvest in the coming months gross margin for q4 decreased to 20 from 57 in the same period last year as a result the procurement of third party supply costs related to ramping up our production and absorbing the tax for medical patients we expect to see margin pressure during the ramp up of our production facilities and during the temporary lack of industry supply longer term we continue to expect 50 plus gross margins as we lower our costs through greenhouse and outdoor cultivation and as we ramp those facilities past the start up phase we also expect reduced revenue per unit as selling wholesale in the adult use market becomes a bigger mix of our revenues our total operating expenses increased to 26 million which includes 4 1 million in non cash stock compensation expense excluding that operating expenses increased to 21 9 million from 5 5 million in the prior year the increase was primarily due to 12 3 million increase in g a associated with higher professional fees and increased resources that support our growth and expansion for the start up of operations for adult use net loss for the quarter was 31 million or 0 33 per share compared to 3 million or 0 04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 net loss included non cash stock compensation charge of 4 1 million compared to 34000 charged in the prior year adjusted ebitda was a loss of 17 8 million compared to a loss of 2 1 million in the fourth quarter of last year the increase in net loss and adjusted ebitda was primarily due to the expected increase in operating expenses related to driving our expansion forward such as investing on continued growth expansion of international teams and costs related to m a and public company costs turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of approximately 517 million as a reminder in october we announced the pricing of a 475 million convertible debt private placement resulting a net proceeds before expenses of about 460 million we intend to use the proceeds for working capital future acquisitions and general corporate purposes we believe we have sufficient capital to execute our capex and offer an expansion plans for the next 12 to 18 months on a longer term basis we intend to further build on our early leadership in the global cannabis industry and to achieve growth for years to come we see an opportunity to capture a sizable portion of this market with estimated gross margins of 50 plus and adjusted ebitda margins of 25 to 30 the ebitda margins are based on the legal markets that exist today and as new markets are added we will invest to develop those markets which could have a short term impact on those margins but also provide for greater revenue upside and a stronger business longer term we are proud of our results and confident we are well positioned to continue to be a leader in the global cannabis industry this concludes our prepared remarks brendan and i are now available to take your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from vivien azer with cowen and company your line is open steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst hi this is steve schneiderman pinch hitting for vivien tonight thanks for taking the call just to lead off just quick housekeeping item can you please clarify whether the revenue numbers of 15 5 million are based on a gross or on a net basis mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer yeah that s net revenues but it does include taxes that s your question steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst yeah thank you that s helpful and you mentioned that you re absorbing the excise tax thank you for that clarification too mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer okay steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst can you guys provide a little bit more detail on the outlook for 2019 in terms of revenues is there any cadence we should be thinking about for the on boarding of novel form factors later in the year mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer yeah so as we mentioned nine months ago we re doing our ipo roadshow we talked about 2018 being double from 2017 and 2019 being at least 3x what 2018 is so as you know we don t give specific guidance but we do give some directional guidance and that 3x was excluding manitoba harvest and for manitoba harvest it s about cad100 million or call it us 75 million and we only had a for 10 months of the year so let s call it around 65 million for this year steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst okay great and while we appreciate the need to buy from third party and it seems like it s weighing on your gross margin yeah i understand that you re looked at double your square footage with supply coming online but can you talk a little bit more about the sequencing of that and how to alleviate some of your headwinds and in particular how much is natura naturals coming into play brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so natura is coming into play it s relatively short small for q1 just because we purchased it during the quarter there was also some commitments for them to sell to other third parties so the off take we re going to have is relatively small in q1 for the full year it s around 10 metric tonnes and could be up to 20 for next year if we do an expansion project there steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst and on the rest of your supply in terms of when we see that coming online this year brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so we continue to see increases each quarter just as the facilities become more mature and we re able to use 100 of the facilities as supposed to having to scale it up throughout this year so you ll see revenues continue to grow especially revenues from our own harvest continue to grow so you ll see margins improve sequentially each quarter this year mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer we ve also completed our first harvest from portugal and we anticipate regular harvest from that facility we won t sell product from portugal until later on this summer so you ll see inventory begin to accumulate there in anticipation of our gmp inspection so that we can export from portugal to other countries around the world steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst and just a follow up to that point brendan can you can you offer some specificity how that may impact the financial model and how that buildup may impact gross margins and will sales from that facility be gross margin accretive to the company brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yes so if you think about portugal and this cost it s cost basis is significant lower than canada and we re going to do an outdoor crop as well as greenhouse crop so again significantly lower cost than our canadian costs so as we re able to sell that product which is going to be more the second half of this year that ll be that will definitely expand the margins and that s all medical product which generally has higher price points mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer and then the final thing you ll see from that portugal facility is that we ll use that facility to meet demand from countries around the world and we ll begin to leave product cultivated in canada inside of canada and so no longer export nearly as much from canada steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst all right great thank you guys very much operator thank you our next question is from tamy chen with bmo capital markets your line is open tamy chen bmo capitals analyst thanks hi brendan and mark first question i just want to go back on the procurement from third party supply is that because of the where the timeline of the ramp is at enniskillen or is it just quality differences or is it there s different strains that the provinces want that you re not growing at enniskillen right now i m just trying to understand that the rationale on the third party supply brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so that the third party supply is primarily because we have significant demand for our products and we re just not able to produce enough to demand as in our built in our model originally as we were planning to have third party supply and if you remember the articles from a year ago we re saying that we were going to be oversupply in canada at this point in time that hasn t happened so it has been part of our plan to use third party supply the quality of that supply is just not available as well as just not enough product available tamy chen bmo capitals analyst okay got it and in terms of the enniskillen facility so i just want to confirm it s the facility now is fully licensed then all areas are planted and growing and can you help me think in terms of timing of the next big harvest from that facility that we should keep in mind when it comes to thinking about your pace of sales in q1 q2 the rest of this year brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah so as far as licensing so that facility is licensed today the production facility in london is not fully licensed so we re using some of the space in the enniskillen facility that will be used for other things like trying so we re not using the full capacity of our at enniskillen facility because of the licensing requirements in london so that will happen we believe in the near term and we ll be able to use enniskillen at more full capacity tamy chen bmo capitals analyst got it okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from rob wertheimer with melius your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hi good evening i wanted to ask about your view on the progress and development of edibles or beverages and other products that might be on sale in canada in 4q just general thoughts and then specific question is that clear to you obviously you re brand new in the jv you re doing but is that clear to you that thc and cbd beverages can be made like attractive and shelf stable in the near term or is that sort of i think you re going to figure out an indeterminate amount of time brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so we think that they can be manufactured and be shelf stable and be tasteful yes tasty over the short term i think that so those are obviously in terms of prioritizing our objectives those are the first things we re looking at we ve also spent a lot of time over the last few years looking at other simple scientific problems to solve so water availability bioavailability time to peak effect duration of effect and we ve solved a lot of those issues and so we were excited to bring a number of different edible products to market whenever we can i guess the big uncertainty is when we re anticipating october of this year but that hasn t there s not complete clarity there and there s also not complete clarity on which exact form factors which exact ingredients will be allowed and what s the packaging for those products will be rob wertheimer melius research analyst do you have a view on whether your experience to date allows you to have a leg up in that when and if it becomes allowed in 4q i don t know what the process is going to be like for approvals whether past experience or manufacturing expertise or whatever i don t know if you view as that of a differentiator or it s early out of the gate or not brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer i think we have some advantages so while we were building out our london ontario facility we built out space for beverages we built out space for oil extraction we built out space for edibles and so from an operations perspective i think being licensed we already we have some advantages there i think where we have a lot of experience that will turn out to be advantageous is that we ve licensed the brand called the goodship that operates in washington state i believe california and there there s knowledge in terms of manufacturing specifically with goodship edibles that contains cbd and thc recipes sops what packaging what manufacturing equipment to use and so those are all things that we re putting into our facility in london ontario and we do feel like we have a leg up because of our that brand and the know how from that brand we also think that our joint venture with ab inbev gives us a leg up on beverage they own 8 of the top 10 beer brands in the world they know how to manufacture beverages all over the world and they have a as you can imagine a robust supply and distribution chain globally rob wertheimer melius research analyst very helpful thank you if i can ask one other one on europe and without trying to get your give specific guidance or outlook but i mean can you see a path where you actually have ready demand for production out of portugal for the full facility when you do it i just don t know the pace of acceptance you know obviously we re trending in a great direction i just don t know the pace of acceptance in the medical community there and i don t know whether you can talk about your efforts to educate or whether that channel doesn t need education it s going to pour in when it becomes available brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer i believe that there s demand for all of our current supply in portugal today and demand for our forecasted supply as we ramp that facility we export today from canada to about a half a dozen european countries we have a global agreement with the sandoz division of novartis that we signed last december and we think we ll add roughly a half a dozen extra countries to that agreement most of which will be in the eu when the european parliament passes resolution on medical cannabis a few weeks ago we were expecting that and so that we expect continued growth not only within the countries in europe that have already legalize medical cannabis but in really in additional countries in europe that will legalize medical cannabis and just to put it in perspective you know in germany back in 2015 there were about 800 patients medical cannabis patients there at the start of last year there are about 16 000 finished last year about 40 000 i expect i estimate that we ll get to about 100 000 patients in germany by the end of this year and so we re seeing rapid growth not only in the number of countries but the number of patients within individual eu countries rob wertheimer melius research analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question is from brett hundley with seaport global your line is open luke perda seaport global analyst hi this is luke perda on for brett hundley here thank you for the detail on your interest in the cbd products market in the us and given the fda s stance i m hoping you can help me understand kind of your approach your view on what the company expects on this front it s our understanding that large cpg companies are putting out rfps for fairly large quantities of cbd in the us is that something that tilray plans to be meaningful one brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer it is so we ve signed an initial supply agreement for a number of different cbd products from either farmers or groups of farmers or processors within the united states and we anticipate signing additional agreements additional supply agreements in the coming months and quarters there s tremendous demand for cbd isolate and hemp derived cbd extracts we ve been approached by a number of cpg companies that have asked us to certify their supply chain whether it s from cbd hemp farmers in montana or colorado or oregon and so we are obviously having conversations with a number of different cpg companies it s really the rationale behind our acquisition of manitoba harvest with manitoba harvest if you can imagine buyers at amazon whole foods costco albertsons as they re looking to put cbd products on their shelves there are a lot of unknown brands out there and a lot of unknown sources of cbd and those retailers they re going to go with a brand they know and a supply chain they trust like manitoba harvest which has been in that business for years the world s largest hemp food manufacturer they control 30 000 acres of hemp cultivation and they re already on the shelves of 16 000 major retailers in the united states and canada luke perda seaport global analyst thank you and kind of building off that manitoba harvest acquisition do you have any growth rate expectations for the next couple of years and kind of an ultimate target margin for that business mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer so the growth rate can just on the food side is between 10 and 15 with the cbd side it is going to be significantly higher than that so we haven t given again we don t give guidance but and some of that is dependent upon timing of cbd and when we can get it on shelves in the us as far as margins gross margins in that business will be around the 50 range with cbd being a larger portion will actually tick up even higher than that luke perda seaport global analyst great thank you and just one more here kind of looking at m a what s on the top of the list for your company what are your view toward products from market areas have your views toward products or market areas changed since the cannabis industry evolved and what are your thoughts on ownership of us dispensary assets that s something that ultimately attractive to tilray or would you rather position yourself elsewhere in the supply chain brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so i ll start with the first part of that question you know when we look at strategic m a we look at transactions we look at companies that open new territories that increase our capacity that increase our brand offerings through new form factors we look at r d so some disruptive technology and selectively we are looking at retail and i put the second part of your question into that retail category i guess when we think about geography we do we are focused right now on the united states and europe and focused on aggressively deploying capital there we certainly are not spending a whole lot of time looking at state licensed dispensary retail locations in the united states today luke perda seaport global analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question is from graeme kreindler with eight capital your line is open graeme kreindler eight capital analyst yeah hi good evening and thanks for taking my call just a first question here as a matter of housekeeping just wanted to confirm the treatment of the excise tax is any of that showing up in the cost of goods sold line and if so what is the amount that mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer so excise tax is it does show up in cost of goods sold i don t have those numbers handy it s relatively small if you think about excise tax it s about a dollar per gram so you can do the math on what we sold at adult use graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay sure understood thanks and then just to go back to follow on the questions with respect to the cbd market in the united states we ve seen i think a bit of a different tap on strategy some people waiting for individual states to regulate and that will be an acceptable framework versus waiting for you know i guess a full fda ruling where does tilray stand on that side in terms of what s needed before we can see commercialization brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so the fda commissioner scott gottlieb announced his resignation is coming up here in april and our perspective is that over the short term that actually speeds up clarification from the fda in the us and so i think we ll see before his departure some clarification on cbd derived from hemp and so we are looking to that as a next step and we re also looking at additional paths to get products to market in the united states that contain cbd certainly before the before the end of the year graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay thanks with respect to your comments earlier brendan on investing in the united states what could that look like in the near to medium term before we see any sort of federally legal cannabis framework in place what sort of forms could that take on brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so i think i mean for us we have secured supply of cbd from us hemp cbd source and i would expect to announce additional sources of us hemp derived cbd in the coming months so that was the first step the second step is if you think about manitoba harvest manitoba harvest sells their products at about 13 000 retailers in the united states plus 3 000 in canada and so if you think about 13 000 retailers in the us that care the manitoba harvest products at expo west in anaheim a few weeks ago manitoba harvest was showing their line of cbd wellness products and so those would be the products that we initially would expect to bring to market as well as additional brands and when i say additional brands if you think about our partnership with authentic brands group they own over 50 of the world s most iconic brands and we have been meeting with them to determine not only which brands but which products we re going to bring to market by the end of the year and i expect that we ll see products from an authentic brands group brands such as something like nine west by year end graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay great and just to follow up on that with respect to the cbd supply chain you talked about the steps made in sort of the procurement of the hemp and cbd isolate on one end and then the end branding packaged goods side on the other things on the other end what about the extraction and formulation step in between that in terms of investments being made to take it from seed or from biomass down to sale brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer if you think about manitoba harvest they receive hemp from 30 000 acres worth of hemp cultivated in canada every year they receive it into the processing facility in winnipeg it then goes from that processing facility to a manufacturing and packaging to state of the art manufacturing and packaging facility outside of winnipeg a town called ste agathe and so that s their experts in hemp processing we would expect to either acquire invest or partner with a group in the us that would enable us to leverage manitoba harvest experience in into the us graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay thanks and one last question here on your comments on investing selectively in retail is that specifically for the canadian market or does that other does that extend to other jurisdictions brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer it does extend to other jurisdictions the retail will look a little bit different in different jurisdictions in canada obviously it s adult use retail if you think about retail in the united states certainly for hemp derived cbd products it will look slightly different from that and if you contrast that with some sort of retail venture in europe it ll be much more wellness focused or pharmaceutical focused graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay thank you very much that s it for me brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question is from michael lavery with piper jaffray your line is open michael lavery piper jaffray analyst thank you can you touch on the abi jv and what are the steps needed for expansion globally is it just as simple as getting recreational use legalized in other markets or how turnkey is it to expand that as new markets open up brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah at the start of last year at the start of 2018 we announced a partnership with the sandoz division of novartis that was specific to canada i think we announced it in january and in december of last year so a few months ago we announced that canadian partnership had become a global partnership with sandoz we took a similar approach with ab inbev and our initial joint venture is for r d of beverages for the canadian market and if you think about a company of that size going through the process that we went with them for a year in terms of performing due diligence in meeting with our team neither party hopes that agreement is just for r d in canada so clearly there is an interest and desire to potentially expand that agreement in the future and so that s what i expect will happen that s what i hope will happen but the first thing we need to do is develop the products and develop the brands and the packaging reform factor and further refine the science and get those products to market when we have an opportunity to commercialize them perhaps as soon as october in canada michael lavery piper jaffray analyst okay that s great thank you we ve covered the us cbd pretty well but can i just follow up one clarification there if before gottlieb leaves he doesn t give more detail or color what s your understanding of the products that are within the regulation and i know you have the tinctures and the hemp oils and the hemp hearts and hemp foods under the manitoba harvest brands you showed it at expo west like you talked about would it just be limited to that is there potentially more are any of those ones you think have any question marks around it what s the right way to understand what your guardrails are if he doesn t give any color before he leaves brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah obviously the existing manitoba harvest products are already in retailers across the united states and don t need any approval from the fda they ve already been approved we believe there s a path to market for cbd products but we need to do it in a way that ensures we comply with sec and nasdaq regulations michael lavery piper jaffray analyst okay thanks and then just one last one for some of the export opportunities that you ve talked about especially as markets open up what are some of the restrictions or conditions if any that might be in place and specifically how dependent is it on those markets not yet having supply built up such that if they built internal capabilities would they be able to turn off the imports and potentially box you out how does the trajectory look or is there any risk to that runway there brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so when i when we think about opportunities we think about three buckets obviously we think about the global medical opportunity in currently 41 countries i think will easily end this year with more than 50 countries that legalized medical cannabis there s a chance we could get to 70 60 or 70 countries over the next really 18 to 24 months and so that s a clear opportunity you know those most countries are not looking to sources product from within their countries certainly none of the 28 members of the eu are looking for that we picked a facility in we picked portugal as a place to build a facility because it had an ideal climate it had a low regulatory costs it had tariff free access to the to eu and so it would be very difficult for a country to prevent product to from it would be very difficult for an eu country to prevent product from portugal from entering that market so we re already building that supply in portugal and we have a global medical distribution partner in sandoz novartis that already has an established supply chain and so when we meet with regulators elected officials bureaucrats in countries around the world as they enter a new regulatory framework as they look to legalize medical cannabis there are so many uncertainties that they face they are strongly encouraged when they see that we have a partner like sandoz and i guess my final point would be that also translates to physicians and pharmacists who are looking for a trusted supplier trusted provider of medical cannabis products and when they see when they see that sandoz a novartis division label on our products it inspires confidence and trusts it builds a halo around our brand michael lavery piper jaffray analyst that s great thank you very much brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from mike hickey with benchmark your line is open mike hickey benchmark co analyst hey guys great quarter thanks for taking my questions appreciate it i think you reiterated your view that you d be increasing your capacity to 90 000 kilograms or 90 metric tons by the end of 19 did that sort of were you already sort of assuming m a because i believe you acquired natura after that you re saying that adding 10 metric tonnes so should that be added or is that sort of already implied in your guidance that you did with m a mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer yeah the 10 of natura should be added but we won t get a full 10 out of natura this year again we didn t buy it in january 1 and we do have some off take agreements that we inherited so we re not going to get the full 10 for tilray mike hickey benchmark co analyst okay thank you indeed on your guidance for 19 or what you re originally expected 3 times 2018 sales it sounds like you re confident on that plus 65 million in net from manitoba is that correct brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer that s correct mike hickey benchmark co analyst and then how did the has the construct of that guidance changed i mean have you sort of fully contemplated the cbd opportunity or is that become a bigger piece of the puzzle and how much of that x manitoba s sales sort of canada versus what you would expect from international mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer so i ll break it down you had a couple of questions in there so so has it changed or hasn t included us cbd originally when we gave that guidance it did not include us cbd the original guidance also assumes that we were going to get plenty of product from canadian suppliers so there are some pluses and minuses for those two and then your question about manitoba i m not sure i understood it mike hickey benchmark co analyst i was just curious i think you answered it primarily just 65 million on top of the 18 yes i think you answered it the last question in the us you re seeing an effort from some of the states that are legalized cannabis to offer locations to publicly consume cannabis curious your view on how that could potentially happen in canada or not and i guess specifically on beverages you know at least in the us where we see quite a bit of work in beverage products and still remains a very niche product category and so i guess the second part of that question is do you think for the beverages to really work you ll need that a sort of social public consumption points call it bars or restaurants for that to be meaningful for you in the future brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer definitely you know in terms of beverages it s all about consumer occasions to consume and whether that s product that s purchased in a you know in a bar or restaurant or a product that s purchased from a 7 eleven or a circle k these products just aren t readily available but we are seeing more and more millennial consumers who aren t interested in or are less interested in alcoholic beverages and they are interested in cannabis and so we think that as a category of cannabis beverages will significantly increase not only in canada but in the us mike hickey benchmark co analyst okay thank you last little question for me when you look at sort of what canada health is given as they re sort of initial view maybe around the regulatory framework around edibles you re seeing sort of maybe limitations on per serving potency or you re seeing maybe limitations on sweeteners and coloring and maybe that the necessity to have separate manufacturing facilities just curious how you sort of fold all that up into making competitive edible products versus the illegal market where they ve already sort of achieved scale and sort of know what the consumer want some of which seems like canada health want to limit particularly like gummies and other products that adult use has shown a lot of demand for brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah when we ve looked at the opportunity in canada over the past two years it s always seemed a little incongruous that a public health organization was limiting the product form factor and essentially limiting consumer s options or choices and essentially forcing them to smoke a product it didn t quite make sense to us we are extremely interested in the opportunity that will be made available to us when we can begin manufacturing and selling non combustible form factors such as edibles and beverage i think you touched on a really important point scale and marketing brands are what beat the black market and if you look at individual us dates the black market has been decimated in washington state it s been decimated in colorado and every restriction that health canada places on the edible market in canada all of those restrictions empower the black market empower products and brands that are already in illicit products and brands that are already in consumer hands having said all that we are strong supporters of portion sizing and limiting the potency of edible products and whether that is a 10 milligram portion cap or a 5 milligram of thc portion cap we ll adjust our products accordingly mike hickey benchmark co analyst thanks guys best of luck brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer thanks mike operator thank you and our last question is some mike grondahl with northland securities your line is open mike grondahl northland securities analyst yeah thank you guys hey brendan i know you kind of called out germany but what other countries do you think are most promising for medical use in the near term brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer oh gosh we re i ll sort of bifurcate that into existing and then future so the uk australia new zealand we continue to see growth there and really chile argentina peru brazil are really early on in their growth curve and then in europe czech republic croatia cyprus all countries that we already ship to i think that we ll see progress and really interesting opportunities inside of the eu really by the end of this year and so whether that s ireland poland france et cetera those are the opportunities that we think are going to come online there s 19 countries in europe that have legalized medical cannabis and so we expect we expect that a population of more than 500 million people will have access to medical cannabis in europe over the next really over the next 12 to 24 months and i think really an important distinction to make between canada and europe is that in canada the government of canada s taxing medical cannabis and in germany they re subsidizing medical cannabis in germany and the rest of europe you re going to see this product made available through government subsidized medical programs and so it s a really different approach from canada that s sometimes it s hard for people to grasp in germany any doctor can write prescription any patient for any illness distributed through a pharmacy with insurance company coverage and you just don t see that in north america today mike grondahl northland securities analyst sure sure and then quick on cbd is there any form factors that you think really stick out with hyper demand or is it just anything with cbd can sell like crazy how do you think about it brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah that s what s interesting about what we saw a few weeks ago at expo west we might we had a pretty large team there from tilray our almost our entire us team was there as well as the team from manitoba harvest and everyone on the team was sending me they re all sending me pictures of different cbd products produced by really mainstream manufacturers and it was i mean it was a cross it ran the gamut in terms of form factors and i think i made a joke the final day that the only thing i didn t see was the cdb toothpaste and two people sent me a cbd toothpaste and so were send me a picture of a cbd toothpaste and so we re seeing it in virtually every form imaginable form factor i think that i think what you re going to see are products mainstream products that contain cbd but then you re also going to see really pharmaceutical grade dietary supplement nutritional supplement products that come from established brands and trusted trusted sources and i think that s probably the i guess probably the biggest opportunity mike grondahl northland securities analyst okay thanks a lot operator thank you and i would like to turn the call back to management for any final remarks brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thanks everyone for joining our call we are very pleased with our performance in q4 and in

brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you katie good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us on today s call i will review the progress we have made on executing on our global growth strategy including our recently announced strategic partnerships and acquisitions and provide an update on our opportunities for long term growth in the global medical and adult use cannabis markets mark will then review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results in more detail and discuss our long term financial targets after that we will open up the call for your questions advertisement advertisement we are still in the early stages of the global transformation of 150 billion worldwide industry we believe that over the long term companies such as tilray with a portfolio of trusted brands powered by multinational supply chains who win the market by earning the confidence of patients consumers and governments around the world taking advantage of tilray s best in class global platform our team continues to focus on being a leader in defining the future of the industry and delivering on the potential we see to be a multi billion dollar consumer packaged goods company focusing on our full year results we are pleased with our growth and momentum revenue increased by 110 year over year to 43 1 million in total the kilogram equivalents sold increased both sequentially and on a year over year basis we achieved this growth despite supply chain constraints across canada that have created pricing pressure for cannabis that meets our quality standards forcing us to source from other suppliers over the next 18 months we believe there will be oversupply just as we have seen in certain us states as operators in new legal markets race and government regulators catch up to find an equilibrium between supply and demand to capitalize on global growth opportunities on both medical and adult use cannabis tilray will deploy capital in most promising markets where we see the greatest potential to pursue multiple paths to grow the united states and european markets are orders of magnitude larger than canada so while canada will continue to be an important market for us we expect to focus the majority of future investments on the us and europe we will not purchase or invest in what we believe to be overpriced supply assets in canada which we believe will erode in value in the medium to long term as the market normalizes advertisement advertisement as we have communicated previously our global growth strategy remains focused on six top line performance drivers that we expect to generate strong returns as the business continues to grow first increase our production capacity and inventory to serve the rapidly growing global market second maintain a rigorous focus on quality as we scale third partner with established distributors and retailers to scale distribution of our products further and faster fourth for the differentiated portfolio brands and products that appeal to a diverse set of patients and consumers fifth expand the addressable medical market by fostering mainstream acceptance with the medical community and governments and finally six pioneer the future of our industry by investing in innovation research and development in clinical research in line with this strategy our recent strategic partnerships include a global alliance with sandoz a division of novartis one of the world s leading pharmaceutical companies our original agreement was focused on canada and this new global deal legitimizes medical cannabis on a global scale and increases access for patients in need across the world in the next year we anticipate distributing medical cannabis to at least a half a dozen more countries globally through this partnership with sandoz we also formed a strategic partnership with ab inbev to research non alcohol beverages containing thc and cbd the 50 50 joint venture combined ab inbev s deep experience and beverages with our expertise in cannabis products and each company intends to invest up to 50 million for a total of up to 100 million we re pleased to report that we have appointed a ceo for the jv and our leveraging the research that tilray has already performed for duration and time the onset on beverages our revenue sharing agreement with authentic brands group abg is a long term partnership designed to leverage abg s portfolio of more than 50 of the world s most iconic brands as well as their extensive distribution network across north america the partnership will initially focus on cbd products in the united states and thc and cbd products in canada and we will expand globally as regulations permit the branding opportunities in the us and europe around the retail and otc consumer products are far more interesting than the branding opportunity today in canada due to packaging and branding restrictions additionally when we look at net new consumers at cbd and thc distributors and retailers mark relationships with brands that they already know and trust which is why we re so excited to partner with abg advertisement advertisement strategic mergers and acquisitions remain a core focus of our global growth strategy last month we closed the acquisition of manitoba harvest the world s largest hemp natural foods producer for approximately 317 million manitoba harvest has nearly cad100 million in gross revenues distributes its products to more than 16 000 retail locations in the us and canada and is the leading hemp foods company with seed to shelf capabilities maintaining control over quality production manufacturing marketing and distribution of its products the acquisition of manitoba harvest is tilray access to relationships with farmers who plant more than 30 000 acres of hemp as well as some of the largest distributors in retailers across canada and the us we look forward to distributing hemp derived cbd products across north america under the manitoba harvest brand as well as other brands by leveraging manitoba harvest s established supply chain going forward we also recently acquired natura naturals holdings inc a federally licensed cannabis cultivation company based in leamington ontario for approximately cad70 million the increased supply from natura which we have rebranded as high park gardens will allow us to further expand our market share in the canadian adult use market with high quality branded cannabis products finally in december we invested cad7 5 million in rose life sciences a quebec based cannabis producer and have an exclusive sale supply distribution and marketing agreement to deliver adult use products under our portfolio of brands in quebec we believe our recent strategic global partnerships and acquisitions demonstrate our emphasis on the diversification of our global opportunities for long term growth and our disruption of critical industries as we expand our addressable market advertisement advertisement our team remains disciplined in our approach making key strategic investments to support the sustainable growth we expect to achieve over the next several years last week we announced that andrew pucher has joined us as our chief corporate development officer overseeing m a and corporate investments andrew previously served as the managing director at goldman sachs where he most recently covered the canadian cannabis industry we are excited about the contributions he will make as we accelerate our growth going forward we will continue to pursue strategic m a that opens new territories increases our capacity increases our brand offerings through innovative farm factors brings us r d technologies and we expect this selectively invest in retail distribution as i said earlier our increased focus on the us and europe among other international markets is tied to the fact that we believe they represent a significantly larger opportunity for tilray long term where we can extend beyond our potential in canada simply put we are building a company for the long term we believe that the field of battle has changed and that the us and europe are going to be more important over the long term in the us tilray is building a portfolio of brands and products with the goal of making them industry leaders in every market where cannabis is legal i believe we are a lot closer to federal legalization in the us than most people realize advertisement advertisement the farm bill presents an excellent opportunity for tilray to capitalize on an estimated us 22 billion hemp derived cbd industry in the us we have us cbd supply chain in place through the acquisition of manitoba harvest in a deal to produce hemp derived cbd infused products for authentic brands group as regulations permit we have also finalized the cbd supply agreement to source cbd from livewell canada and the united states for wellness and medical tilray branded cbd products across north america we expect livewell to begin shipping product to us during the second quarter of 2019 in the coming months we expect to make additional announcements about strategic investments and partnerships in the us to position tilray for long term leadership in the market focusing on europe just last month the european parliament passed a resolution similar to the world health organization s recommendation to increase access to medical cannabis further legitimizing the industry and we believe this decision will encourage other states and countries to legalize we began 2018 with 28 countries having legalized medical use globally and ended the year with 41 and we can easily see how that number grows to 50 or 60 by the end of 2019 our eu campus in portugal completed a successful medical harvest earlier this month and we are well positioned to serve the eu market as more countries legalize we expect the eu campus to produce and distribute cannabis in the eu for the eu and believe that having a local vertically integrated supply chain presence is an important differentiator for us to reduce costs and hedge against regulatory risk our campus includes indoor outdoor and greenhouse cultivation sites as well as research labs processing packaging and distribution sites for medical products advertisement advertisement this first harvest was a significant milestone for the company and we expect multiple harvests in the coming months by the end of 2019 we expect to increase our production space to 2 2 million square feet approximately double compared to the end of 2018 on our existing properties we have the ability to expand our total production space to 4 5 million square feet our seven production facilities around the world are significantly increasing our global production output compared to 2018 while the canadian market remains challenged with quality supply we are confident the supply demand will become more balanced over time as additional supply becomes available longer term we do not believe tilray will be in the farming business so we re not allowing the near term supply disruption to change our strategy for growth over the next two years from a retail perspective we ve have taken small steps in canada including minority investments in fire flower inner spirit and westleaf and expect to invest more aggressively in the months to come to aiding our global expansion we have formed an international advisory board to provide strategic perspective to our executive team and board of directors the advisory board consists of 10 internationally renowned business and government leaders who continue to provide us with strategic insights as we pioneer the future of our industry as mentioned earlier we have also expanded our global senior leadership team with six strategic executive hires from world class organizations to help our existing teams spearhead our future growth and development internationally in addition to andrew pucher as our new chief corporate development officer from goldman sachs we hired greg christopher who joined from nestle to be our executive vice president of operations rita seguin joined from diageo as executive vice president of human resources advertisement advertisement dara redler our general counsel joined from coca cola charlie cain our vice president of retail joined from starbucks and sascha mielcarek our managing director europe joined us from grunenthal at the same time our team remains deeply committed to clinical research this is important for the future of medicine as well as being a competitive differentiator in the industry and has accelerated awareness very positive awareness in international medical cannabis market most recently in the fourth quarter we partnered with researchers at the lambert initiative for cannabinoid therapeutics at the university to sydney to complete a study examining the effects of cannabis on driving and cognitive function the trial phase of the study culminated in 2018 and results are expected to be published sometime this year looking ahead to the balance of the year and into 2020 we continue to anticipate the following corporate milestones launching tilray and manitoba harvest cbd products in the us as regulations permit signing additional adult use supply agreements in canada shipping tilray products to pharmacy chains in canada exporting tilray medical products to new countries expanding tilray s medical cannabis product offerings in the international markets we currently serve extending our existing pharmaceutical partnerships to additional countries and regions obtaining a sales license for high park s processing facility in london ontario additional clinical trials recruiting additional executives from outside of the industry to further strengthen our management team and finally adding strategic partnerships and acquisitions in the united states and europe in summary we are incredibly proud of our achievements in 2018 and are excited about our growth potential over the next several years we will continue to execute on our strategic initiatives and take actions that will fuel long term value for our shareholders as well as our customers consumers patients and employees around the world with that i would like to turn the call over to mark mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer thanks brendan good afternoon to those of you joining us on the today s call and webcast it is a pleasure to be speaking with you today please note all the financial information we discussed today is prepared in accordance with us gaap that is in us dollars unless otherwise indicated we are pleased to report the fourth quarter financial results and the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead focusing on fourth quarter results in more detail q4 revenue was 15 5 million representing an increase of 204 as compared to the fourth quarter last year revenue growth is driven by the inaugural sales for the canadian adult use market bulk sales and accelerated wholesale distribution in export markets extract products represented a greater mix at approximately 54 of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 24 of revenue for the same period last year we are pleased with the performance in adult use market so far and expect adult use to be a growth driver for 2019 as we continue to ramp up supply and with additional form factors that are expected to be included in our results later this year moving on to operational metrics total kilogram equivalents sold increased more than threefold to 2053 kilograms from 694 kg in the same quarter of 2017 the overall average net selling price per gram increased to 7 52 from 7 13 in the prior year the increase is primarily due to an increase in mix of higher priced extract products with improved price per gram as a percentage of total revenue compared to the prior year looking at the canadian direct to patient sales our average selling price per gram increase 9 4 to 7 43 compared to 6 79 per gram again primarily due to product mix drilling into adult use our average and selling price per gram was 5 40 per gram which we expect to increase over the longer term as higher price value added products become available in q4 on the production side we continue to expect significant increase throughout 2019 as we expand our capacity to 90 metric tonnes as we bring our ontario greenhouse and portugal facilities fully online as brendan mentioned we ve recently completed successful harvest at our eu campus in portugal and has a multiple harvest in the coming months gross margin for q4 decreased to 20 from 57 in the same period last year as a result the procurement of third party supply costs related to ramping up our production and absorbing the tax for medical patients we expect to see margin pressure during the ramp up of our production facilities and during the temporary lack of industry supply longer term we continue to expect 50 plus gross margins as we lower our costs through greenhouse and outdoor cultivation and as we ramp those facilities past the start up phase we also expect reduced revenue per unit as selling wholesale in the adult use market becomes a bigger mix of our revenues our total operating expenses increased to 26 million which includes 4 1 million in non cash stock compensation expense excluding that operating expenses increased to 21 9 million from 5 5 million in the prior year the increase was primarily due to 12 3 million increase in g a associated with higher professional fees and increased resources that support our growth and expansion for the start up of operations for adult use net loss for the quarter was 31 million or 0 33 per share compared to 3 million or 0 04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 net loss included non cash stock compensation charge of 4 1 million compared to 34000 charged in the prior year adjusted ebitda was a loss of 17 8 million compared to a loss of 2 1 million in the fourth quarter of last year the increase in net loss and adjusted ebitda was primarily due to the expected increase in operating expenses related to driving our expansion forward such as investing on continued growth expansion of international teams and costs related to m a and public company costs turning to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of approximately 517 million as a reminder in october we announced the pricing of a 475 million convertible debt private placement resulting a net proceeds before expenses of about 460 million we intend to use the proceeds for working capital future acquisitions and general corporate purposes we believe we have sufficient capital to execute our capex and offer an expansion plans for the next 12 to 18 months on a longer term basis we intend to further build on our early leadership in the global cannabis industry and to achieve growth for years to come we see an opportunity to capture a sizable portion of this market with estimated gross margins of 50 plus and adjusted ebitda margins of 25 to 30 the ebitda margins are based on the legal markets that exist today and as new markets are added we will invest to develop those markets which could have a short term impact on those margins but also provide for greater revenue upside and a stronger business longer term we are proud of our results and confident we are well positioned to continue to be a leader in the global cannabis industry this concludes our prepared remarks brendan and i are now available to take your questions operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from vivien azer with cowen and company your line is open steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst hi this is steve schneiderman pinch hitting for vivien tonight thanks for taking the call just to lead off just quick housekeeping item can you please clarify whether the revenue numbers of 15 5 million are based on a gross or on a net basis mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer yeah that s net revenues but it does include taxes that s your question steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst yeah thank you that s helpful and you mentioned that you re absorbing the excise tax thank you for that clarification too mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer okay steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst can you guys provide a little bit more detail on the outlook for 2019 in terms of revenues is there any cadence we should be thinking about for the on boarding of novel form factors later in the year mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer yeah so as we mentioned nine months ago we re doing our ipo roadshow we talked about 2018 being double from 2017 and 2019 being at least 3x what 2018 is so as you know we don t give specific guidance but we do give some directional guidance and that 3x was excluding manitoba harvest and for manitoba harvest it s about cad100 million or call it us 75 million and we only had a for 10 months of the year so let s call it around 65 million for this year steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst okay great and while we appreciate the need to buy from third party and it seems like it s weighing on your gross margin yeah i understand that you re looked at double your square footage with supply coming online but can you talk a little bit more about the sequencing of that and how to alleviate some of your headwinds and in particular how much is natura naturals coming into play brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so natura is coming into play it s relatively short small for q1 just because we purchased it during the quarter there was also some commitments for them to sell to other third parties so the off take we re going to have is relatively small in q1 for the full year it s around 10 metric tonnes and could be up to 20 for next year if we do an expansion project there steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst and on the rest of your supply in terms of when we see that coming online this year brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so we continue to see increases each quarter just as the facilities become more mature and we re able to use 100 of the facilities as supposed to having to scale it up throughout this year so you ll see revenues continue to grow especially revenues from our own harvest continue to grow so you ll see margins improve sequentially each quarter this year mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer we ve also completed our first harvest from portugal and we anticipate regular harvest from that facility we won t sell product from portugal until later on this summer so you ll see inventory begin to accumulate there in anticipation of our gmp inspection so that we can export from portugal to other countries around the world steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst and just a follow up to that point brendan can you can you offer some specificity how that may impact the financial model and how that buildup may impact gross margins and will sales from that facility be gross margin accretive to the company brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yes so if you think about portugal and this cost it s cost basis is significant lower than canada and we re going to do an outdoor crop as well as greenhouse crop so again significantly lower cost than our canadian costs so as we re able to sell that product which is going to be more the second half of this year that ll be that will definitely expand the margins and that s all medical product which generally has higher price points mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer and then the final thing you ll see from that portugal facility is that we ll use that facility to meet demand from countries around the world and we ll begin to leave product cultivated in canada inside of canada and so no longer export nearly as much from canada steve schneiderman cowen and company analyst all right great thank you guys very much operator thank you our next question is from tamy chen with bmo capital markets your line is open tamy chen bmo capitals analyst thanks hi brendan and mark first question i just want to go back on the procurement from third party supply is that because of the where the timeline of the ramp is at enniskillen or is it just quality differences or is it there s different strains that the provinces want that you re not growing at enniskillen right now i m just trying to understand that the rationale on the third party supply brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so that the third party supply is primarily because we have significant demand for our products and we re just not able to produce enough to demand as in our built in our model originally as we were planning to have third party supply and if you remember the articles from a year ago we re saying that we were going to be oversupply in canada at this point in time that hasn t happened so it has been part of our plan to use third party supply the quality of that supply is just not available as well as just not enough product available tamy chen bmo capitals analyst okay got it and in terms of the enniskillen facility so i just want to confirm it s the facility now is fully licensed then all areas are planted and growing and can you help me think in terms of timing of the next big harvest from that facility that we should keep in mind when it comes to thinking about your pace of sales in q1 q2 the rest of this year brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah so as far as licensing so that facility is licensed today the production facility in london is not fully licensed so we re using some of the space in the enniskillen facility that will be used for other things like trying so we re not using the full capacity of our at enniskillen facility because of the licensing requirements in london so that will happen we believe in the near term and we ll be able to use enniskillen at more full capacity tamy chen bmo capitals analyst got it okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from rob wertheimer with melius your line is open rob wertheimer melius research analyst hi good evening i wanted to ask about your view on the progress and development of edibles or beverages and other products that might be on sale in canada in 4q just general thoughts and then specific question is that clear to you obviously you re brand new in the jv you re doing but is that clear to you that thc and cbd beverages can be made like attractive and shelf stable in the near term or is that sort of i think you re going to figure out an indeterminate amount of time brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so we think that they can be manufactured and be shelf stable and be tasteful yes tasty over the short term i think that so those are obviously in terms of prioritizing our objectives those are the first things we re looking at we ve also spent a lot of time over the last few years looking at other simple scientific problems to solve so water availability bioavailability time to peak effect duration of effect and we ve solved a lot of those issues and so we were excited to bring a number of different edible products to market whenever we can i guess the big uncertainty is when we re anticipating october of this year but that hasn t there s not complete clarity there and there s also not complete clarity on which exact form factors which exact ingredients will be allowed and what s the packaging for those products will be rob wertheimer melius research analyst do you have a view on whether your experience to date allows you to have a leg up in that when and if it becomes allowed in 4q i don t know what the process is going to be like for approvals whether past experience or manufacturing expertise or whatever i don t know if you view as that of a differentiator or it s early out of the gate or not brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer i think we have some advantages so while we were building out our london ontario facility we built out space for beverages we built out space for oil extraction we built out space for edibles and so from an operations perspective i think being licensed we already we have some advantages there i think where we have a lot of experience that will turn out to be advantageous is that we ve licensed the brand called the goodship that operates in washington state i believe california and there there s knowledge in terms of manufacturing specifically with goodship edibles that contains cbd and thc recipes sops what packaging what manufacturing equipment to use and so those are all things that we re putting into our facility in london ontario and we do feel like we have a leg up because of our that brand and the know how from that brand we also think that our joint venture with ab inbev gives us a leg up on beverage they own 8 of the top 10 beer brands in the world they know how to manufacture beverages all over the world and they have a as you can imagine a robust supply and distribution chain globally rob wertheimer melius research analyst very helpful thank you if i can ask one other one on europe and without trying to get your give specific guidance or outlook but i mean can you see a path where you actually have ready demand for production out of portugal for the full facility when you do it i just don t know the pace of acceptance you know obviously we re trending in a great direction i just don t know the pace of acceptance in the medical community there and i don t know whether you can talk about your efforts to educate or whether that channel doesn t need education it s going to pour in when it becomes available brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer i believe that there s demand for all of our current supply in portugal today and demand for our forecasted supply as we ramp that facility we export today from canada to about a half a dozen european countries we have a global agreement with the sandoz division of novartis that we signed last december and we think we ll add roughly a half a dozen extra countries to that agreement most of which will be in the eu when the european parliament passes resolution on medical cannabis a few weeks ago we were expecting that and so that we expect continued growth not only within the countries in europe that have already legalize medical cannabis but in really in additional countries in europe that will legalize medical cannabis and just to put it in perspective you know in germany back in 2015 there were about 800 patients medical cannabis patients there at the start of last year there are about 16 000 finished last year about 40 000 i expect i estimate that we ll get to about 100 000 patients in germany by the end of this year and so we re seeing rapid growth not only in the number of countries but the number of patients within individual eu countries rob wertheimer melius research analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question is from brett hundley with seaport global your line is open luke perda seaport global analyst hi this is luke perda on for brett hundley here thank you for the detail on your interest in the cbd products market in the us and given the fda s stance i m hoping you can help me understand kind of your approach your view on what the company expects on this front it s our understanding that large cpg companies are putting out rfps for fairly large quantities of cbd in the us is that something that tilray plans to be meaningful one brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer it is so we ve signed an initial supply agreement for a number of different cbd products from either farmers or groups of farmers or processors within the united states and we anticipate signing additional agreements additional supply agreements in the coming months and quarters there s tremendous demand for cbd isolate and hemp derived cbd extracts we ve been approached by a number of cpg companies that have asked us to certify their supply chain whether it s from cbd hemp farmers in montana or colorado or oregon and so we are obviously having conversations with a number of different cpg companies it s really the rationale behind our acquisition of manitoba harvest with manitoba harvest if you can imagine buyers at amazon whole foods costco albertsons as they re looking to put cbd products on their shelves there are a lot of unknown brands out there and a lot of unknown sources of cbd and those retailers they re going to go with a brand they know and a supply chain they trust like manitoba harvest which has been in that business for years the world s largest hemp food manufacturer they control 30 000 acres of hemp cultivation and they re already on the shelves of 16 000 major retailers in the united states and canada luke perda seaport global analyst thank you and kind of building off that manitoba harvest acquisition do you have any growth rate expectations for the next couple of years and kind of an ultimate target margin for that business mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer so the growth rate can just on the food side is between 10 and 15 with the cbd side it is going to be significantly higher than that so we haven t given again we don t give guidance but and some of that is dependent upon timing of cbd and when we can get it on shelves in the us as far as margins gross margins in that business will be around the 50 range with cbd being a larger portion will actually tick up even higher than that luke perda seaport global analyst great thank you and just one more here kind of looking at m a what s on the top of the list for your company what are your view toward products from market areas have your views toward products or market areas changed since the cannabis industry evolved and what are your thoughts on ownership of us dispensary assets that s something that ultimately attractive to tilray or would you rather position yourself elsewhere in the supply chain brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so i ll start with the first part of that question you know when we look at strategic m a we look at transactions we look at companies that open new territories that increase our capacity that increase our brand offerings through new form factors we look at r d so some disruptive technology and selectively we are looking at retail and i put the second part of your question into that retail category i guess when we think about geography we do we are focused right now on the united states and europe and focused on aggressively deploying capital there we certainly are not spending a whole lot of time looking at state licensed dispensary retail locations in the united states today luke perda seaport global analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question is from graeme kreindler with eight capital your line is open graeme kreindler eight capital analyst yeah hi good evening and thanks for taking my call just a first question here as a matter of housekeeping just wanted to confirm the treatment of the excise tax is any of that showing up in the cost of goods sold line and if so what is the amount that mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer so excise tax is it does show up in cost of goods sold i don t have those numbers handy it s relatively small if you think about excise tax it s about a dollar per gram so you can do the math on what we sold at adult use graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay sure understood thanks and then just to go back to follow on the questions with respect to the cbd market in the united states we ve seen i think a bit of a different tap on strategy some people waiting for individual states to regulate and that will be an acceptable framework versus waiting for you know i guess a full fda ruling where does tilray stand on that side in terms of what s needed before we can see commercialization brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so the fda commissioner scott gottlieb announced his resignation is coming up here in april and our perspective is that over the short term that actually speeds up clarification from the fda in the us and so i think we ll see before his departure some clarification on cbd derived from hemp and so we are looking to that as a next step and we re also looking at additional paths to get products to market in the united states that contain cbd certainly before the before the end of the year graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay thanks with respect to your comments earlier brendan on investing in the united states what could that look like in the near to medium term before we see any sort of federally legal cannabis framework in place what sort of forms could that take on brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so i think i mean for us we have secured supply of cbd from us hemp cbd source and i would expect to announce additional sources of us hemp derived cbd in the coming months so that was the first step the second step is if you think about manitoba harvest manitoba harvest sells their products at about 13 000 retailers in the united states plus 3 000 in canada and so if you think about 13 000 retailers in the us that care the manitoba harvest products at expo west in anaheim a few weeks ago manitoba harvest was showing their line of cbd wellness products and so those would be the products that we initially would expect to bring to market as well as additional brands and when i say additional brands if you think about our partnership with authentic brands group they own over 50 of the world s most iconic brands and we have been meeting with them to determine not only which brands but which products we re going to bring to market by the end of the year and i expect that we ll see products from an authentic brands group brands such as something like nine west by year end graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay great and just to follow up on that with respect to the cbd supply chain you talked about the steps made in sort of the procurement of the hemp and cbd isolate on one end and then the end branding packaged goods side on the other things on the other end what about the extraction and formulation step in between that in terms of investments being made to take it from seed or from biomass down to sale brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer if you think about manitoba harvest they receive hemp from 30 000 acres worth of hemp cultivated in canada every year they receive it into the processing facility in winnipeg it then goes from that processing facility to a manufacturing and packaging to state of the art manufacturing and packaging facility outside of winnipeg a town called ste agathe and so that s their experts in hemp processing we would expect to either acquire invest or partner with a group in the us that would enable us to leverage manitoba harvest experience in into the us graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay thanks and one last question here on your comments on investing selectively in retail is that specifically for the canadian market or does that other does that extend to other jurisdictions brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer it does extend to other jurisdictions the retail will look a little bit different in different jurisdictions in canada obviously it s adult use retail if you think about retail in the united states certainly for hemp derived cbd products it will look slightly different from that and if you contrast that with some sort of retail venture in europe it ll be much more wellness focused or pharmaceutical focused graeme kreindler eight capital analyst okay thank you very much that s it for me brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question is from michael lavery with piper jaffray your line is open michael lavery piper jaffray analyst thank you can you touch on the abi jv and what are the steps needed for expansion globally is it just as simple as getting recreational use legalized in other markets or how turnkey is it to expand that as new markets open up brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah at the start of last year at the start of 2018 we announced a partnership with the sandoz division of novartis that was specific to canada i think we announced it in january and in december of last year so a few months ago we announced that canadian partnership had become a global partnership with sandoz we took a similar approach with ab inbev and our initial joint venture is for r d of beverages for the canadian market and if you think about a company of that size going through the process that we went with them for a year in terms of performing due diligence in meeting with our team neither party hopes that agreement is just for r d in canada so clearly there is an interest and desire to potentially expand that agreement in the future and so that s what i expect will happen that s what i hope will happen but the first thing we need to do is develop the products and develop the brands and the packaging reform factor and further refine the science and get those products to market when we have an opportunity to commercialize them perhaps as soon as october in canada michael lavery piper jaffray analyst okay that s great thank you we ve covered the us cbd pretty well but can i just follow up one clarification there if before gottlieb leaves he doesn t give more detail or color what s your understanding of the products that are within the regulation and i know you have the tinctures and the hemp oils and the hemp hearts and hemp foods under the manitoba harvest brands you showed it at expo west like you talked about would it just be limited to that is there potentially more are any of those ones you think have any question marks around it what s the right way to understand what your guardrails are if he doesn t give any color before he leaves brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah obviously the existing manitoba harvest products are already in retailers across the united states and don t need any approval from the fda they ve already been approved we believe there s a path to market for cbd products but we need to do it in a way that ensures we comply with sec and nasdaq regulations michael lavery piper jaffray analyst okay thanks and then just one last one for some of the export opportunities that you ve talked about especially as markets open up what are some of the restrictions or conditions if any that might be in place and specifically how dependent is it on those markets not yet having supply built up such that if they built internal capabilities would they be able to turn off the imports and potentially box you out how does the trajectory look or is there any risk to that runway there brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer so when i when we think about opportunities we think about three buckets obviously we think about the global medical opportunity in currently 41 countries i think will easily end this year with more than 50 countries that legalized medical cannabis there s a chance we could get to 70 60 or 70 countries over the next really 18 to 24 months and so that s a clear opportunity you know those most countries are not looking to sources product from within their countries certainly none of the 28 members of the eu are looking for that we picked a facility in we picked portugal as a place to build a facility because it had an ideal climate it had a low regulatory costs it had tariff free access to the to eu and so it would be very difficult for a country to prevent product to from it would be very difficult for an eu country to prevent product from portugal from entering that market so we re already building that supply in portugal and we have a global medical distribution partner in sandoz novartis that already has an established supply chain and so when we meet with regulators elected officials bureaucrats in countries around the world as they enter a new regulatory framework as they look to legalize medical cannabis there are so many uncertainties that they face they are strongly encouraged when they see that we have a partner like sandoz and i guess my final point would be that also translates to physicians and pharmacists who are looking for a trusted supplier trusted provider of medical cannabis products and when they see when they see that sandoz a novartis division label on our products it inspires confidence and trusts it builds a halo around our brand michael lavery piper jaffray analyst that s great thank you very much brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question is from mike hickey with benchmark your line is open mike hickey benchmark co analyst hey guys great quarter thanks for taking my questions appreciate it i think you reiterated your view that you d be increasing your capacity to 90 000 kilograms or 90 metric tons by the end of 19 did that sort of were you already sort of assuming m a because i believe you acquired natura after that you re saying that adding 10 metric tonnes so should that be added or is that sort of already implied in your guidance that you did with m a mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer yeah the 10 of natura should be added but we won t get a full 10 out of natura this year again we didn t buy it in january 1 and we do have some off take agreements that we inherited so we re not going to get the full 10 for tilray mike hickey benchmark co analyst okay thank you indeed on your guidance for 19 or what you re originally expected 3 times 2018 sales it sounds like you re confident on that plus 65 million in net from manitoba is that correct brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer that s correct mike hickey benchmark co analyst and then how did the has the construct of that guidance changed i mean have you sort of fully contemplated the cbd opportunity or is that become a bigger piece of the puzzle and how much of that x manitoba s sales sort of canada versus what you would expect from international mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer so i ll break it down you had a couple of questions in there so so has it changed or hasn t included us cbd originally when we gave that guidance it did not include us cbd the original guidance also assumes that we were going to get plenty of product from canadian suppliers so there are some pluses and minuses for those two and then your question about manitoba i m not sure i understood it mike hickey benchmark co analyst i was just curious i think you answered it primarily just 65 million on top of the 18 yes i think you answered it the last question in the us you re seeing an effort from some of the states that are legalized cannabis to offer locations to publicly consume cannabis curious your view on how that could potentially happen in canada or not and i guess specifically on beverages you know at least in the us where we see quite a bit of work in beverage products and still remains a very niche product category and so i guess the second part of that question is do you think for the beverages to really work you ll need that a sort of social public consumption points call it bars or restaurants for that to be meaningful for you in the future brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer definitely you know in terms of beverages it s all about consumer occasions to consume and whether that s product that s purchased in a you know in a bar or restaurant or a product that s purchased from a 7 eleven or a circle k these products just aren t readily available but we are seeing more and more millennial consumers who aren t interested in or are less interested in alcoholic beverages and they are interested in cannabis and so we think that as a category of cannabis beverages will significantly increase not only in canada but in the us mike hickey benchmark co analyst okay thank you last little question for me when you look at sort of what canada health is given as they re sort of initial view maybe around the regulatory framework around edibles you re seeing sort of maybe limitations on per serving potency or you re seeing maybe limitations on sweeteners and coloring and maybe that the necessity to have separate manufacturing facilities just curious how you sort of fold all that up into making competitive edible products versus the illegal market where they ve already sort of achieved scale and sort of know what the consumer want some of which seems like canada health want to limit particularly like gummies and other products that adult use has shown a lot of demand for brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah when we ve looked at the opportunity in canada over the past two years it s always seemed a little incongruous that a public health organization was limiting the product form factor and essentially limiting consumer s options or choices and essentially forcing them to smoke a product it didn t quite make sense to us we are extremely interested in the opportunity that will be made available to us when we can begin manufacturing and selling non combustible form factors such as edibles and beverage i think you touched on a really important point scale and marketing brands are what beat the black market and if you look at individual us dates the black market has been decimated in washington state it s been decimated in colorado and every restriction that health canada places on the edible market in canada all of those restrictions empower the black market empower products and brands that are already in illicit products and brands that are already in consumer hands having said all that we are strong supporters of portion sizing and limiting the potency of edible products and whether that is a 10 milligram portion cap or a 5 milligram of thc portion cap we ll adjust our products accordingly mike hickey benchmark co analyst thanks guys best of luck brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer thank you mark castaneda chief financial officer secretary and treasurer thanks mike operator thank you and our last question is some mike grondahl with northland securities your line is open mike grondahl northland securities analyst yeah thank you guys hey brendan i know you kind of called out germany but what other countries do you think are most promising for medical use in the near term brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer oh gosh we re i ll sort of bifurcate that into existing and then future so the uk australia new zealand we continue to see growth there and really chile argentina peru brazil are really early on in their growth curve and then in europe czech republic croatia cyprus all countries that we already ship to i think that we ll see progress and really interesting opportunities inside of the eu really by the end of this year and so whether that s ireland poland france et cetera those are the opportunities that we think are going to come online there s 19 countries in europe that have legalized medical cannabis and so we expect we expect that a population of more than 500 million people will have access to medical cannabis in europe over the next really over the next 12 to 24 months and i think really an important distinction to make between canada and europe is that in canada the government of canada s taxing medical cannabis and in germany they re subsidizing medical cannabis in germany and the rest of europe you re going to see this product made available through government subsidized medical programs and so it s a really different approach from canada that s sometimes it s hard for people to grasp in germany any doctor can write prescription any patient for any illness distributed through a pharmacy with insurance company coverage and you just don t see that in north america today mike grondahl northland securities analyst sure sure and then quick on cbd is there any form factors that you think really stick out with hyper demand or is it just anything with cbd can sell like crazy how do you think about it brendan kennedy president and chief executive officer yeah that s what s interesting about what we saw a few weeks ago at expo west we might we had a pretty large team there from tilray our almost our entire us team was there as well as the team from manitoba harvest and everyone on the team was sending me they re all sending me pictures of different cbd products produced by really mainstream manufacturers and it was i mean it was a cross it ran the gamut in terms of form factors and i think i made a joke the final day that the only thing i didn t see was the cdb toothpaste and two people sent me a cbd toothpaste and so were send me a picture of a cbd toothpaste and so we re seeing it in virtually every form imaginable form factor i think that i think what you re going to see are products mainstream products that contain cbd but then you re also going to see really pharmaceutical grade dietary supplement nutritional supplement products that come from established brands and trusted trusted sources and i think that s probably the i guess probably the biggest opportunity mike grondahl

the mission of the international monetary fund completed its work in kyiv the national bank once again did not dare to lower its key rate while the government continued to raise social standards and take new loans ahead of the elections these are the key economic news of the outgoing week this week the mission of ukraine s key creditor the international monetary fund completed its work in kyiv the main topic of discussions with the ukrainian authorities was the resonant decision of the constitutional court of ukraine on the abolition of illegal enrichment article in the criminal code the norm had been introduced in 2015 as part of anti corruption measures in the course of the previous cooperation program with the fund the ccu ruling has already sparked sharp reaction from international partners and may become an obstacle for further cooperation with the imf but so far no statements from the fund have followed as the delegation simply gathered the necessary information and left experts believe that the lender will make an informed decision the issue concerns the implementation of the previous imf program restoration of responsibility for this violation is a complex legal and procedural issue which is difficult to figure out from afar all the way from washington explains olena belan chief economist at dragon capital she recalls that the mission s decisive visit on the next bailout tranche is expected in may and by this time ukraine needs to have fulfilled a number of conditions including to appoint judges of the high anti corruption court adopt the split law on optimization state regulation of markets of non banking financial services and review gas prices by the way the issue of raising by 15 gas prices for households from may 1 2019 as stipulated by the imf cooperation program and set out in the state budget may also be a subject of debate the relatively warm winter contributed to the fact that european prices for natural gas fell almost to the level of the current gas price for ukrainian households given this fact in the outgoing week prime minister volodymyr groysman announced negotiations between njsc naftogaz of ukraine the ministry of finance and the international monetary fund видео дня i will instruct naftogaz together with the ministry of finance to start a working discussion with the international monetary fund to resolve the issue and prevent any increases in gas relying on the proposal of naftogaz of ukraine the pm said obviously the upcoming review of the program by the imf will be a difficult one meanwhile the national bank is seeing no risks for continued cooperation with the fund even taking into account the ruling of the constitutional court we continue to work as usual and see no risks in this for the continued cooperation with the imf and receiving the next tranches which are scheduled for may and november said nbu governor yakiv smolii nbu assessing risks despite the slowdown in inflation and optimistic expectations the national bank did not dare to lower its key rate which could contribute to cheaper bank loans and accelerate economic growth at a traditional monetary briefing on thursday the nbu governor announced that the rate remained unchanged at 18 per annum for the fourth consecutive time previously the national bank made similar decisions in october and december 2018 as well as in january 2019 the nbu explained their indecisiveness by the relevance of previously identified risks that may impede a further decrease in inflation as well as a number of new risks associated with the next increase in social standards it s about monetization of subsidies that started in march of this year for which almost uah 5 7 billion will be allocated from the state budget this month in addition since march the government has introduced automatic indexation of pensions thanks to which payments will increase for almost 9 million of 10 2 million ukrainian pensioners the amount of the increase will average uah 515 according to nbu estimates raising social standards is unlikely to have a significant impact on consumer price hikes while being able to push inflation expectations we evaluated the impact of individual decisions regarding monetization of subsidies and the increase in pensions but for each of these elements we had estimates of up to 0 1 commented serhiy mykolaichuk head of the nbu monetary policy and economic analysis department but this may affect inflation expectations given the information campaign that accompanied these measures despite nbu fears the cabinet in its pre election fever has been pumping social spending at its traditional meeting on wednesday the government introduced additional payments for large families from april 1 they will receive an additional uah 1 700 for each child starting from the third until their kids reach the age of six as stated by the minister of social policy andriy reva the cabinet of ministers is this way implementing the initiative of president poroshenko to help children in large families by the end of the year uah 2 4 billion will have been allocated in the framework of this program new loans the unprecedented generosity of ukrainian authorities in relation to the electorate does not reduce the urgency of financing the budget deficit to this end in the outgoing week the ministry of finance increased by 350 million the amount of ten year eurobonds issued in october last year the interest rate as in october was at 9 75 while the settlement on the transaction is scheduled for march 21 finance minister oksana markarova explained that the transaction was due to the need for timely financing of budget expenditures considering that in 2019 we must spend uah 418 billion on servicing and paying off debts besides clearly monitoring tax and non tax revenues we must conduct monthly internal and external borrowings she said the finance ministry recalled that this year ukraine has already attracted a eur 529 million loan guaranteed by the world bank and also announced talks with official lenders on new concession loans in addition funds are being actively attracted in the domestic market in the first two months of this year the state budget received almost uah 35 billion us 886 million and eur 33 million from auctioning off domestic bonds it should be noted that the rates on domestic loans remain very high at 19 for securities in uah 6 5 in dollars and 4 5 in euros on the other hand investors are not yet ready to lend ukraine funds at more attractive rates given that the credit ratings remain low in the outgoing week fitch confirmed ukraine s sovereign rating at b which reflects the country s external liquidity which is still weak as well as political risks next week promises to be no less interesting the state statistics service will release data on the growth of the ukrainian economy over the past year and the dynamics of industrial output we might also see the outcome of an ongoing conflict between naftogaz ceo andriy kobolyev and prime minister volodymyr groysman the head of government promised to discuss the proposal of naftogaz supervisory board to extend kobolyev s contract for another year while reducing his salary by half in addition groysman proposed to oblige the head of naftogaz to ensure the growth of domestic gas output transmission of russian gas from 2020 and the company unbundling kobolyev s dismissal under groysman s scenario could be rather costly for the ukrainian treasury according to valeria hudiy a lawyer with ilyashev and partners the termination of the contract provides for a severance pay which taking into account the salary of naftogaz ceo may amount to about uah 171 million failure to pay this benefit as well as dismissal in violation of the established procedure without a proper motion of the supervisory board may be the subject of litigation olha hordienko
state investment in transportation public buildings water treatment systems and other forms of vital infrastructure is key to creating good jobs and promoting full economic recovery states should reject the flawed economic growth strategy of cutting taxes and offering corporate giveaways and instead identify and make investments in infrastructure that provide the foundation for a strong economy it s a good time for states to make those investments every state needs infrastructure improvements that can pay off economically in private sector investment and productivity growth the condition of roads bridges schools water treatment plants and other physical assets greatly influences the economy s ability to function and grow commerce requires well maintained roads railroads airports and ports so that manufacturers can obtain raw materials and parts and deliver finished products to consumers growing communities rely on well functioning water and sewer systems state of the art schools free from crowding and safety hazards improve educational opportunities for future workers every state needs infrastructure improvements that can pay off economically in private sector investment and productivity growth states may be hoping that a promised federal plan to invest more in roads bridges and other public infrastructure will materialize more federal help would be welcome but states should take the lead in this area because the type and amount of assistance they d receive under any new federal initiative remain unclear the president s fiscal year 2019 infrastructure proposal for example claimed to invest 1 5 trillion in real new federal infrastructure resources but it is a mirage the budget in fact would have cut total federal funding for infrastructure in the long run the proposal would have added 200 billion in new federal funds that the administration claimed could support at least 1 5 trillion in investment but in the long run it would have deeply cut the highway trust fund and suggests that states and localities would have to fill the gap president trump also noted the need for infrastructure investment in his 2020 budget which again calls for allocating 200 billion but provides no new details on how it would be used but rather than investing in infrastructure many states have cut taxes and have offered corporate subsidies in a misguided approach to boosting economic growth tax cuts will spur little to no economic growth and take money away from schools universities and other public investments essential to producing the talented workforce that businesses need this pattern of neglect of infrastructure by states the primary stewards along with their local government partners of the nation s infrastructure has serious consequences for the nation s growth and quality of life as roads crumble school buildings become obsolete and outdated facilities jeopardize public health states should address unmet infrastructure needs now for several reasons the investment will improve state economies now and in the future higher quality and more efficient infrastructure will boost productivity in states that make the needed investments lifting long term economic growth and wages in the short term even though overall employment has recovered millions of americans are working less than they would like and making less than it takes to get by key infrastructure investments would provide immediate job opportunities opportunities to finance infrastructure investment abound states often pay for building new schools roads airports water treatment facilities and the like using debt a sound practice for financing infrastructure that can serve generations today s historically low interest rates are especially favorable to such borrowing and state and local debt is below pre recession levels but with the federal reserve raising interest rates this opportunity may diminish soon states also have many other revenue sources available including user fees like tolls as well as federal grants most states are in a relatively strong position to afford these investments the nation s economy has slowly recovered from the great recession finally lifting state revenues above pre recession levels better enabling states on average to afford infrastructure investments the long recovery has improved state revenues significantly but the pace of state tax growth is slowing in many states revenues remain insufficient to adequately cover the costs of needed services such as education and health care and still make the necessary infrastructure investments these states will need to consider tax increases to preserve public capital that is crucial to long term economic growth while meeting other needs a number of states have recognized the historic opportunity and need for infrastructure investments for example washington is in the midst of a multi year transportation improvement initiative and more than half of the states have raised their gas taxes a key source of funds for road construction since 2013 but overall states are cutting infrastructure spending as a share of the economy the opposite of what is needed spending by state and local governments on all types of capital dropped from its high of 3 percent of the nation s gross domestic product gdp in the late 1960s to less than 2 percent in 2017 falling federal spending on infrastructure is exacerbating the problem states must turn their attention back to the type of infrastructure investments that will boost productivity support business growth create jobs provide a healthier environment and improve opportunities for all of their residents the specific investments needed will differ from state to state depending on factors like the condition of the existing infrastructure and the mix of industries in the region but states continue to ignore needed investments at the country s peril investment in public infrastructure is falling with real consequences in the decades after world war ii the united states built an interstate highway system hundreds of airports a massive network of waterworks and expanded port facilities and other infrastructure that significantly boosted the country s economic output much of this infrastructure is in dire need of repair in addition better functioning infrastructure including more efficient public transit systems and more environmentally friendly water and sewer systems could boost economic growth and quality of life despite these needs governments at all levels are failing to make the improvements that the nation s roads bridges and other infrastructure need the nation s infrastructure needs improvement across the united states years of neglect have resulted in crumbling roads bridges in need of repair inadequate public transport outdated school buildings and other critical infrastructure needs in its most recent report card on the condition of america s infrastructure the american society of civil engineers asce gave u s infrastructure a d or poor rating the engineers estimated the cost of bringing america s infrastructure to a state of good repair a grade of b by 2025 at 4 6 trillion of which only about 55 percent has been committed improving roads and bridges alone would require 1 1 trillion more than states localities and the federal government have allocated schools need another 380 billion beyond what s been invested see figure 1 and table 2 in the appendix other studies have supported and built on the asce findings for instance america s drinking water treatment and distribution systems need 473 billion in investments over the next 20 years according to the environmental protection agency over half of america s public schools need to be repaired renovated or modernized according to a u s department of education survey and almost 20 percent of the country s roads are in poor condition according to the federal highway administration s most recent survey these needs vary significantly by state because of differences in size congestion and age of existing infrastructure for example 54 percent of the roads in rhode island are in poor condition while only 9 percent of roads in north carolina are according to asce ohio needs over 100 billion to improve its drinking water treatment facilities while georgia with a population similar to ohio needs just over 20 billion the asce report card also includes information on state infrastructure needs and investment state and local governments are the primary stewards of the country s infrastructure state and local governments are the stewards of most of the country s public capital they own over 90 percent of non defense public infrastructure assets and although the federal government assists in the building and maintenance of these assets state and local governments pay 75 percent of the cost of maintaining and improving them see figure 2 states and localities spend the vast majority of their capital dollars 85 percent on key building blocks of a state s economy schools transportation and drinking water treatment and distribution see table 1 not surprisingly current investment varies significantly by state based on factors like the size and population density of a state or the age of existing infrastructure but some differences result from the willingness of the state to identify and fund needed investments overall investments have been declining as needs have risen figure 3 shows the portion of total state spending devoted to capital spending in 2014 several large states with small populations alaska north dakota south dakota and wyoming spent over 15 percent of their budget on capital expenses at the other end of the spectrum three states michigan rhode island and new hampshire spent less than 7 percent table 1 state and local governments account for nearly 75 of public infrastructure spending billions 2004 public federal

62 5 170 3 173 5 how states pay for infrastructure projects states pay for public buildings facilities roads and other infrastructure somewhat differently than they fund other types of spending for example they use debt more frequently and often rely on user fees like tolls to fund infrastructure in addition the federal government provides grants for roads transit and other infrastructure but state revenues are required regardless of the funding method that s used borrowing must be repaid and federal grants often require matching funds borrowing there are sound reasons why states and localities borrow to pay for infrastructure rather than use annual tax collections and other revenues public buildings roads and bridges are used for decades but entail large upfront costs borrowing enables the state to spread out those costs as a result taxpayers who will use the infrastructure in the future help pay for it which promotes intergenerational equity borrowing also makes infrastructure projects more affordable by reducing the pressure on a state s budget in any given year on average states finance 27 percent of their capital spending with bond proceeds share chart on facebook share chart on twitter chart some states either by law or by tradition do not usually issue general obligation bonds for infrastructure or other spending twenty two states report that they maintain a formal or informal policy of funding infrastructure on a pay as you go basis according to a 2014 national association of state budget officers nasbo survey a this means they look exclusively or primarily to cash on hand from taxes fees grants or other sources to pay for capital projects bond proceeds make up less than 10 percent of funding for capital projects in 16 states b taxes and fees on average states finance only a small share 5 percent of infrastructure with general fund taxes typically sales or income taxes not designated for specific purposes however this practice varies by state states that shy away from borrowing for infrastructure projects depend much more heavily on general fund taxes to pay for building and maintaining infrastructure general fund spending makes up more than 20 percent of funding for capital projects in six states colorado georgia indiana new jersey tennessee and wyoming b more typically the general fund share is small and other state funds make up over a third of funding for capital projects this includes taxes designated for infrastructure such as gas taxes or user fees like tolls water and sewer fees or facility entry fees grants the federal government is an active partner with states in building and maintaining infrastructure states use federal grants to pay for some 28 percent of their infrastructure spending the federal government provides grants for road and public transit projects for utilities and a host of other capital expenditures public private partnerships in addition the private sector sometimes partners with states and localities to jointly fund a needed infrastructure project or in some cases the private sector builds or maintains a road or a public facility in return for collecting tolls or other user fees associated with the facility any state spending related to public private partnerships is not identified separately by nasbo in the chart above a national association of state budget officers capital budgeting in the states spring 2014 b national association of state budget officers state expenditure report 2017 infrastructure spending is down across government federal infrastructure investment has fallen by half from 1 percent to 0 5 percent of gdp over the last 35 years leaving more of the task to state and local governments for example federal spending on transportation and water infrastructure has fallen in real terms since 2003 and the federal gas tax has not been increased since 1992 the five year federal transportation bill enacted in 2015 falls short of providing the amount needed to maintain and expand the nation s road system and even the new investments in the 2015 legislation will be at risk in future years because they are paid for with cuts in other parts of the budget rather than an increase in the gas tax the congressional budget office estimates that the federal highway trust fund will be insolvent after 2021 that is the projected costs will exceed revenue from federal gas and other taxes and interest generated by the fund in the 1990s when the economy was particularly strong states and localities increased their investments but this trend ended after the turn of the century except for a temporary boost fueled by federal infrastructure funding to states and localities from the 2009 recovery act spending by state and local governments on all types of capital fell from 2 4 percent of gdp in the early 2000s to 1 87 percent in 2017 and is now lower than it has been since the 1950 see figure 4 total capital spending as a share of state gdp fell in all but nine states between 2002 and 2016 with the largest drops in nevada arizona utah and florida these states revenues were hit particularly hard by the great recession resulting in cuts in all parts of the budget especially after the federal recovery act funds were depleted but capital spending has not bounced back in these states or most others even as the economy has recovered see figure 5 investment in public infrastructure fuels economic growth the condition of roads bridges schools water treatment plants and other physical assets greatly affects the economy s ability to function and grow commerce requires well maintained roads railroads airports and ports so that manufacturers can obtain raw materials and parts and deliver finished products to consumers improving many types of public infrastructure boosts the productivity of businesses by reducing their costs growing communities rely on well functioning water and sewer systems state of the art schools free from crowding and safety hazards improve educational opportunities for future workers better roads and public transit make it feasible or more efficient for workers to get from their home communities to more of the places where the jobs are carefully targeted initiatives to maintain and improve public infrastructure boost a state s long term productivity resulting in more economic growth and higher wage jobs in the short term when conditions are right public infrastructure investments also can create needed jobs well targeted public investment in infrastructure improves private productivity research shows recent research has found that infrastructure investments generally result in a more productive economy which typically means higher wages and a better quality of life the interactions between public infrastructure investments and private sector growth are however highly complex and difficult to quantify early studies on the topic showed mixed results but on balance studies conducted between the late 1990s and 2007 tended to confirm a relationship between public infrastructure investment and economic growth although not all studies find a growth enhancing effect of public capital there is more of a consensus in the recent literature than in the older literature a 2007 survey of over 75 studies of the relationship concluded the search for ways to restore economic growth following the 2007 09 recession prompted additional research on this topic many of these more recent studies found that spending on public infrastructure has a positive and statistically significant effect on productivity and thus economic growth although the magnitude of the effects found in individual studies differed the general findings of the most recent studies are that an increase in the value of existing current capital stock roads bridges and other infrastructure would increase productivity growth economists prepared a number of estimates of the impact of an additional dollar of infrastructure spending on gdp growth in 2008 during the debate over a federal fiscal stimulus package these estimates found that in the depths of the great recession a dollar in infrastructure investment would result in 1 50 in gdp growth according to the council of economic advisers similarly moody s a leading private econometric firm estimated the effect at 1 60 the congressional budget office found that that the impact ranged from a low estimate of 1 00 to 2 50 even when the economy is at or near full employment investment in infrastructure increases the productivity of companies and workers and thus the rate of growth of the economy this is especially true now when there is such significant room for improvement in the country s transportation water treatment and other assets poor roads bridges and transit greatly influence a company s ability to do business outdated water treatment systems and schools hurt the health and quality of life of a community and its residents other key points for state policymakers to keep in mind include a portion of the economic benefits may spill over into neighboring states the majority of the studies of the effects of infrastructure investment focus on national spending but some have looked specifically at the effect of infrastructure spending in u s states or cities generally the effect of state infrastructure spending on economic growth was found to be different often somewhat smaller than the effect of federal spending because of something called the spillover effect that is the benefits of improving the roads or other infrastructure of one state may spill over to neighboring states and improve commerce in both states because of the spillover effect state investments have a larger impact on national economic growth than on growth in the individual state making the investment and somewhat paradoxically failing to account for these spillover effects in economic models can lead to an artificially low estimate of the overall effect of state capital spending the majority of the studies of the effects of infrastructure investment focus on national spending but some have looked specifically at the effect of infrastructure spending in u s states or cities generally the effect of state infrastructure spending on economic growth was found to be different often somewhat smaller than the effect of federal spending because of something called the spillover effect that is the benefits of improving the roads or other infrastructure of one state may spill over to

the investment and somewhat paradoxically failing to account for these spillover effects in economic models can lead to an artificially low estimate of the overall effect of state capital spending the size of the impact may vary by region not surprisingly a number of studies on the differences among countries find that the largest positive effects occur in places where the quantity and quality of infrastructure lag the same would hold true within the united states regions that have underinvested in infrastructure historically are thus ones where increased investments could have the largest payoffs not surprisingly a number of studies on the differences among countries find that the largest positive effects occur in places where the quantity and quality of infrastructure lag the same would hold true within the united states regions that have underinvested in infrastructure historically are thus ones where increased investments could have the largest payoffs states need to evaluate the tradeoffs state policymakers will need to prioritize infrastructure projects and weigh their value against other state needs since states generally have so underinvested in their infrastructure there s little question that they can identify affordable projects that will boost productivity over time at the same time many states have also neglected to invest properly in their residents education health and quality of life in some cases states will need to raise revenue to meet these various needs and all states will need to evaluate the tradeoffs involved in choosing various investments over others in addition some revenue sources often used to finance infrastructure such as tolls fall more heavily on low income taxpayers states may choose to avoid these sorts of financing options for this reason or consider ways to offset the negative effects such as by enacting or expanding targeted tax credits like the earned income tax credit public infrastructure investment can spur job growth under the right conditions investment in infrastructure boosts employment as soon as building begins with large public construction projects generating hundreds of well paying jobs many of the new jobs last only as long as the project is being constructed but for major projects they can last for multiple years plus other jobs will be needed to maintain the structures once they have been built extending the project s job creation impact the jobs created mainly in fields like construction tend to pay middle or high wages so they can boost workers standard of living this job creation has the greatest impact on state economies when there s slack in the economy and many unemployed or underemployed workers are available to fill these jobs when the economy moves closer to full employment as it has now improving the country s infrastructure generates better paying jobs and can reduce inequality for example a number of the jobs that will be required to operate maintain and build the country s infrastructure such as electricians pump operators and bus drivers offer competitive wages and are available to workers without a college degree in addition improvements to transportation systems can address pockets of higher unemployment that exist even when the country approaches full employment by making it easier for workers to get to areas with jobs when there are readily available workers projects that bring an influx of new money into a state because they are funded with federal dollars or through borrowing as most state infrastructure projects are can be particularly effective at boosting employment and earnings on the other hand if a state raises taxes or cuts other spending to pay for some or all of the project at the outset the impact on a state s employment would be smaller but likely still positive especially if the taxes raised are those paid by high income individuals or businesses if their taxes were lower businesses or individuals might otherwise save that money or spend it outside the state but if these dollars are instead used to pay for a public construction project a significant portion goes to in state workers improving the local economy as workers spend their paychecks in the area materials and equipment purchased from in state companies would have a similar effect state infrastructure projects may leverage private funds as well adding to the economic benefits see the discussion of the various funding methods in the box above investment in public infrastructure can improve a state s quality of life the environment and opportunity on top of the economic benefits well designed investments in parks libraries schools and better roads and public transit can improve residents quality of life there are also a host of ways to improve the country s environment with investments in green technology for waste treatment energy production and public transit improved quality of life new and improved public amenities can bring less tangible but very real benefits to state residents for example a community is improved in ways that may be difficult to measure when children are taught in up to date and uncrowded schools that provide the latest technology as well as good athletic and arts facilities these sorts of investments can expand the opportunities available to children and enhance their learning experiences an area s quality of life also increases when people have easy access to modern libraries and well designed and maintained parks and well maintained roads bridges and public transit that make commutes smoother improve both commerce and quality of life a better environment many types of public infrastructure play a major role in maintaining and improving the country s environment fully one quarter of the country s non defense public capital directly affects the environment with water and sewer plants conservation and recreation facilities and power plants making up 11 percent 6 5 percent and 3 percent of non defense public capital respectively transportation other than roads accounts for another 6 5 percent of non defense public capital states can improve their local and regional environment by carefully designing new power plants public transit and water and sewer treatment facilities these benefits to the state and region are very real even if they do not always show up in typical measurements of economic growth and productivity that are studied in the research on the impact of infrastructure a cleaner environment can improve the health of residents and improve quality of life by providing places for recreation and wildlife improved opportunity for all a major reason for public as opposed to private investment in infrastructure is to ensure that people of all income levels have access to amenities like good roads schools and hospitals when an investment s benefits are so spread out over time and place that it is not feasible to profit from them the private sector cannot be relied upon to provide those investments rather it is up to government at all levels to ensure equal access but even when the public sector plays the leading role in providing for an asset such as elementary and secondary schools inequities can arise for example a higher percentage of public schools in poor areas are in need of repair than those in the wealthiest places see figure 6 part of the reason for this is that schools are often funded by local property taxes and property values are lower in poor areas in addition poorer areas are often home to outdated infrastructure beyond schools for example aging lead water pipes are much more common in the lowest income neighborhoods or cities this brings the potential for dire health problems and the associated health and economic costs as the experience of flint michigan has demonstrated increased investment by states that is targeted to low income areas can help address these problems it s time for states to invest more in infrastructure a decade from the great recession some states and localities may still be hesitant to take on more debt despite their extensive infrastructure needs that s a mistake in part because conditions for borrowing remain good states and localities current interest costs are low interest payments on debt averaged just 3 4 percent of current spending in 2016 the lowest level since census began tracking this data in 1977 interest payments made up less than 5 percent of state and local spending in all states but illinois interest payments on debt averaged just 3 4 percent of current spending in 2016 the lowest level since census began tracking this data in 1977 interest payments made up less than 5 percent of state and local spending in all states but illinois total state and local debt is below pre recession levels measured as a share of the economy state and local debt has fallen since 2009 and is below pre recession levels if borrowing returned to pre recession levels as a share of the economy an additional 790 billion would be available with which states and localities could address infrastructure needs for comparison the aggregate value of all bonds issued for school construction and rehabilitation between 2003 and 2012 was 514 billion measured as a share of the economy state and local debt has fallen since 2009 and is below pre recession levels if borrowing returned to pre recession levels as a share of the economy an additional 790 billion would be available with which states and localities could address infrastructure needs for comparison the aggregate value of all bonds issued for school construction and rehabilitation between 2003 and 2012 was 514 billion borrowing is inexpensive for many years the federal reserve has kept the short term interest rate that banks charge to borrow from each other very low this in turn has kept the interest rates charged for other types of loans including bonds purchased from state and local governments low as well although the federal reserve has begun raising short term interest rates the congressional budget office projects that interest rates will remain below historical levels for many years the federal reserve has kept the short term interest rate that banks charge to borrow from each other very low this in turn has kept the interest rates charged for other types of loans including bonds purchased from state and local governments low as well although the federal reserve has begun raising short term interest rates the congressional budget office projects that interest rates will remain below historical levels the federal government subsidizes state and local borrowing the federal government provides that interest from investments in state and local government bonds is exempt from federal income taxes the federal tax exemption effectively subsidizes state and local infrastructure projects since states and localities otherwise would need to pay bond investors a higher interest rate the federal tax bill enacted in 2017 retained this exemption state economies are finally recovering from the great recession as the nation s economy has slowly recovered overall state revenues have exceeded their pre recession levels better enabling states on average to afford infrastructure investments but in many states revenues still aren t sufficient to adequately cover the costs of needed services such as education health care and infrastructure investments so some states will need to consider tax increases to preserve the public capital that is crucial to long term economic growth and revenue collections remain below historic averages as a share of the economy in many states suggesting that there is room for tax increases for important investments in roads

the imf mission left ukraine quietly without official statements about future cooperation at stake are two tranches that are very important given the repayment of billions of dollars in debts scheduled for this year the national bank and the ministry of finance say there is no need to worry everything goes according to schedule experts are less optimistic the inflows may be delayed which means that pressure on the hryvnia exchange rate is inevitable the mission of the international monetary fund which worked in kyiv from march 5 to march 13 left quietly without making a single statement following the negotiations with the ukrainian authorities the national bank explained this by the fact that the visit was technical and it did not provide for making a decision on granting or delaying the next tranche and there will be two of them this year 1 3 billion each in may and november the tranches will be allocated on the basis of a review of compliance with the conditions of the new 14 month stand by program in the amount of 3 9 billion which was approved by the imf in december 2018 in the same month ukraine received the first tranche of 1 4 billion the fate of the next loan will traditionally be decided by the imf mission it is scheduled to arrive on may 15 and november 15 the main beacons of the fund are the increase in gas prices for the households which is stipulated by the budget for the current year set to start in may the start of large scale privatization which has been frustrated for the fifth year in a row the split law stipulating optimization of state regulation of non banking services market the reform of the fiscal service to separate it into tax and customs agencies and the intensification of the fight against corruption including the creation of the anti corruption court and while the latter is almost at the finish line the anti corruption innovations of ukraine as a whole became the main topic of discussion between the imf and ukraine authorities this is about a resonant decision of the constitutional court on the abolition of criminal liability for illegal enrichment this rule was introduced in 2015 as part of anti corruption measures in the course of the previous cooperation program with the fund the verdict of the ccu has already provoked a strong reaction from international partners the g7 and the world bank consider the ccu decision to be a defeat in the fight against corruption in our country this may affect relations with the imf and its help is needed more than ever in 2019 2020 the needs of ukraine in external financing will be very high for example this year 4 3 billion will be spent on servicing external public debt alone 1 7 billion on repayment and about 2 4 billion on repayment in 2020 2021 meanwhile the national bank does not yet see any risks for continued cooperation with the fund we continue to work as usual continue to cooperate with the imf and expect to receive tranches in may and in november said head of the nbu yakiv smolii видео дня head of the ministry of finance oksana markarova is also calm she assures that ukraine has fulfilled most of the conditions of the imf to receive the next tranche of the loan most of the conditions that must be fulfilled by the end of march have been fulfilled or are in the process of their implementation she said stressing that the current program with the imf is quite realistic according to her the authorities are looking for mechanisms to resume responsibility for illegal enrichment after its abolition by the decision of the constitutional court while preserving the already launched cases against corrupt officials the experts interviewed by unian are less optimistic they allow the delay of the next tranche of the loan and the reason for this may be the verdict of the constitutional court as well as the delay in the implementation of the terms of the memorandum will there be a tranche mykhailo rebryk a senior analyst at raiffeisen bank aval believes that the issue of the abolition of the article on illegal enrichment by the constitutional court is a principled thing which frags from previous programs and if it is not resolved in the near future the fund s tranche will be at least delayed the postponement of the tranche is a bad signal to investors who are already nervous about the upcoming elections in my opinion the situation is more alarming than it was in february the exchange rate may jump and pull inflation if the tranche is delayed but in general ukraine s international reserves are at a good level and the banking system is strong so we don t expect the negative scenario to be realized the expert noted olena belan chief economist at dragon capital stressed that the latest visit of the imf mission was a working one aimed to assess the situation on the ground and understand the details in particular regarding the decision of the constitutional court since this issue concerns the implementation of the previous imf program restoration of responsibility for this violation is a complex legal and procedural issue which is hard to grasp from washington based on the mission s information the fund s management will negotiate with ukraine on this aspect the evaluation mission for the revision of the current program is expected to arrive in may ukraine demonstrates some progress in the implementation of structural beacons the key conditions of the imf in particular in the matter of creating the anti corruption court which was considered one of the most difficult ones to implement we are almost at the finish line candidates have already been selected for the posts of judges now it remains to appoint them but there are failures by the end of march it is necessary for the verkhovna rada to adopt a split law the division of the functions of the national commission for regulation of financial services markets between the national bank and the national commission on securities and stock market so far there is no consensus in parliament on this issue most likely this beacon will not have been completed by the deadline but it can be executed later as a rule during the work of an assessment mission unfulfilled structural beacons fall into the list of preliminary measures without which the receipt of the tranche is impossible it also seems that the issue of gas prices is back on the agenda but in an unusual context for ukraine due to the warm winter gas prices are dropping in europe if european prices remain at this level then the planned 15 increase in the domestic price will raise it above the import parity therefore it is possible that this issue will be a subject for discussion with the imf the expert noted according to her the delay of the next tranche from the imf bears significant risks for the economy since in this case the government will not be able to receive funding from the eu budget and enter the foreign market with a large issue of eurobonds which is necessary to replenish the treasury these foreign borrowings can be postponed to september when large external repayments are coming including 1 1 billion in sovereign eurobonds otherwise it will be necessary to squeeze budget expenditures as much as possible in order to pay off external debts and this would be very painful for the economy and even more painful for politicians amid the election year belan stressed that non payment of external debt will negatively affect ukraine when a country does not pay its debts this is a default that is fraught with the closure of credit lines for international projects and trade finance for companies panic among businesses and the public and a surge in demand for currency in the end the situation may spin completely out of control which will also affect the ratings of political parties on the eve of parliamentary elections oleksandr martynenko head of the corporate analysis department at icu believes that of the four key conditions the so called structural beacons of the program which must be implemented this spring only two have been implemented this is the division of the state fiscal service into tax and customs services as well as the publication of a report on asset recovery and trials relating to state banks the split law has not been adopted and the process of electing anti corruption judges has not been completed the adoption of the split law on the redistribution of the functions of supervision of the non banking financial sector in parliament is particularly problematic and could be delayed until the end of the presidential election also a number of other conditions specified in the imf memorandum are not fulfilled this may postpone the revision of the program conditions by the fund and the release of the second tranche which is scheduled for may 15 in addition the second tranche of macro financial assistance from the eu in the amount of 500 million euros may be postponed because continued cooperation with the imf is one of the conditions of this package finally it will cause great difficulties in raising funds on financial markets to finance the payment of foreign currency debt the government s need to attract them is estimated by us at least 7 billion for this year the expert explained according to the head of the expert analytical council of the ukrainian analytical center borys kushniruk the main role in the question of relations with the imf is played by elections and the risk is considerable if we have another head of state no matter who we will need to re discuss relations with the imf since the memorandum of cooperation with the foundation has been signed by the incumbent president most likely further relations with the fund will be paused until ukraine s position under the new government has been clarified in addition parliamentary elections are coming what promises can groysman give to the fund and partners if his own fate is unclear that is for the fund the future of ukraine as a whole will be more important than that of personalities the implementation of the fund s beacons is not as significant as a change in the country s leadership i think in view of the political component there will not be a tranche until at least next spring moreover the change of leadership will take place at the end of may and the mission should arrive in ukraine in mid may and there is an important mismatch it will not yet be clear how the president will behave if there is a change in addition according to the budget list from may 1 the gas price for the households should be revised upwards and there is a question how the new president will act but this year our country will have to repay billions in liabilities and if there is no tranche then there is a big risk of destabilization of the national currency rate which could trigger panic on the market and taking into account the populist statements of politicians which are now voiced on the eve of elections such a scenario cannot be ruled out a change of leadership always implies a new dialogue with partners and this takes time and it does not play into the hands of ukraine that is there will be new negotiations and nobody will give money during this period therefore the pressure on the hryvnia exchange rate will be unequivocal the expert concluded and while the fate of ukraine s relations with the imf is being determined rating agencies have started publishing their outlooks on ukraine fitch ratings has affirmed ukraine s long term foreign currency issuer default rating idr at b with a stable outlook fitch notes that the ranking reflects weak external liquidity high external financing needs driven by sovereign external debt repayments a weak banking sector institutional constraints and political risks according to experts timely compliance with the new imf program is key to facilitating external financing supporting progress in macroeconomic stability and mitigating vulnerabilities related to weak external liquidity the potential for increased domestic political uncertainty and broader emerging markets volatility that is without external funding the country could find itself on the verge of default so the authorities should take balanced and reasonable decisions rather than dive too deep into their election campaigns nana chornaya
briefing highlights what to expect in the budget stocks loonie oil at a glance air canada grounds max 8 jets from today s globe and mail brace for march spending madness craig wright finance minister bill morneau has a lot to juggle but he also has some mad money and you can expect to share in it when he drops his pre election budget after markets close economists expect mr morneau and his liberals under siege amid the snc lavalin affair to offer canadians a fair bit under a second trudeau government while still coming across as fiscally responsible the backdrop is an interesting one economic growth has flatlined but the jobs market is solid and unemployment low canada still has a strong credit rating and revenue has topped expectations open this photo in gallery finance minister bill morneaudave chan the globe and mail we expect the march 19 federal budget to reflect this government s penchant for spending said royal bank of canada chief economist craig wright after all it had no trouble boosting spending by an average of 6 5 per cent annually while the political and economic winds were blowing favourably he added in his budget lookahead titled brace for march spending madness with storm clouds appearing in the form of weaker than expected domestic economic growth we doubt the finance minister will change course here s a look the goodies what to expect observers are betting on child care measures at least some talk of pharmacare and ways to boost labour skills each could have substantial costs associated with them mr wright said we re betting that each of these initiatives will get a down payment in the current budget with promises of more to come in future years he added we would welcome a focus on skills since it could address a current business challenge while at the same time creating better conditions for stronger economic growth in the period ahead mr morneau is also expected to do something to help millennials get into the housing market possibly by extending the maximum mortgage amortization among other things economists have warned that housing measures risk driving up home prices again after policy makers at the federal and provincial levels have worked so hard to bring them down and corral a debt bubble as for pharmacare it s not clear how far the government will go in terms of universal coverage in this budget said laurentian bank securities chief economist sébastien lavoie and economist dominique lapointe every province has its own mix of private and public drug prescription coverage they said this patchwork of insurance plans is inefficient they added noting that canada has the third highest per capita spending on drugs across the countries of the organization for economic co operation and development after the united states and switzerland second many canadians do not have access to the medication they need due to steep prices and insufficient coverage a sweeping pharmacare plan would cost 19 3 billion if ottawa absorbed the whole thing the laurentian economists said citing numbers from the parliamentary budget officer the federal government could propose later this year the creation of such an initiative for 2020 as part of their election campaign they added the government of canada would likely bear the cost by transferring new funding to the provinces which would ease financial pressures indeed we believe that the most likely scenario is that the new federal program will preserve private sector and provincial public coverage that goes beyond the essential medicine formulary and under partial coverage costs would probably come in shy of that pbo number the goods the economic backdrop economic growth is suffering almost stalling in the fourth quarter and expected to do little better in the current three month period the canadian economy is in stagnation a much worse situation than a year ago when global economic momentum was strong said laurentian s mr lavoie and mr lapointe particularly the rising number of consumer insolvencies fading consumer spending and the cooling in activity in some housing markets calls for action at the same time the labour market is strong the economy is expected to perk up later this year when you put everything together including whatever mr morneau does today bank of nova scotia chief economist jean françois perrault projected a significant acceleration in growth once we re through this quarter of course that will be then and this is now rbc s mr wright warned that mr morneau has to assume a weakening revenue backdrop as he spends given the stall in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter and probably in the first as a result growth forecasts for nominal gdp a key driver of government revenues are being reduced mr wright said we currently expect nominal gdp to rise by 2 1 per cent this year compared to an assumed growth rate of 4 1 per cent in the government s fall economic statement he added calling on mr morneau to exercise spending caution lest he miss his targets and upset the downward trend in the ratio of debt to gdp to be sure the government will get a break from lower than anticipated interest rates but this won t be enough to offset the impact of slower economic growth hey good lookin budget balances the fiscal situation is certainly not dire with the deficit weighing in at a modest 0 8 per cent of gdp bank of montreal senior economist robert kavcic and benjamin reitzes canadian rates and macro strategist said in bmo s budget preview also ottawa s 3 billion risk adjustment is enough at this point to absorb a chunk of the downside from a weaker near term economic growth forecast cibc world markets chief economist avery shenfeld also has an interesting way of looking at it recall that in the last election canadians voted for the major party that wasn t promising a balanced budget mr shenfeld said in that they were running ahead of economists who only recently are coming around to a more benign view of debts and deficits in a low interest rate era albeit within limits and the liberals are lookin good at this point so far this fiscal year ottawa s finances are in far better shape than expected with an actual surplus in the first nine months of more than 300 million thanks to a surge in revenue keep in mind that mr morneau s target for the full 2018 19 year is 18 1 billion as of the fall economic statement and you get a sense of that mad money but this month is interesting because where fiscal policy is concerned march tends to come in like a lion and go out like a lion our view is bolstered by the fact that the final month of the government s fiscal year is typically a large deficit month said rbc s mr wright over the last 10 years the march deficit has averaged 7 3 billion and the average over the last three under the current finance minister was 10 billion he added the most recent run includes three of the four largest monthly federal deficits on record with that history in mind we anticipate the march madness to continue in the form of substantial spending announcements the projected 18 1 billion deficit is deemed small particularly when compared to other countries and the liberals are looking at a different measure ottawa has held to its promise of keeping its new fiscal anchor the debt to gdp ratio steady it is actually on pace to dip for a second straight year said mr kavcic and mr reitzes there s an issue there for the bmo economists though the concern with this measure is that it s an anchor that is destined to break they said given we are late in the economic cycle the next downturn will immediately weaken the denominator sending that metric higher from a longer term credit perspective it would be prudent to see this ratio falling more significantly late in the cycle read more markets at a glance read more more news from today s globe and mail

officer thank you raphael we appreciate everyone joining us for the quarterly call before walking through our q4 results and plans for 2019 i wanted to briefly highlight some key financial and strategic takeaways from 2018 as i believe they will provide great context for what we hope to accomplish this year first we achieved our sixth consecutive year of comparable restaurant sales growth across the del taco system with a 2 5 increase while our company operated restaurants generated a 1 5 increase franchise comparable restaurant sales grew at even faster rate of 3 8 which we view as indicative of our strengthening franchise system and del taco s brand portability across a diverse geographic footprint in fact franchise auvs have increased approximately 30 in the last five years across a 13 state footprint with more than half of these restaurants located outside of california our franchise momentum coupled with our non core western market refranchising strategy that i will discuss shortly is expected to stimulate development interest across existing and new franchisees to help expand del taco s brand reach second we hold our restaurant contribution margin steady at 19 7 demonstrating our effective margin management strategy despite only modest same store sales growth at company restaurants fiscal 2018 was our fourth consecutive year achieving a restaurant contribution margin of approximately 20 and we only recently achieved a 1 5 million auv margin management has become a strong confidency to del taco and is critically important during this extended inflationary cycle third we opened 25 restaurants across the del taco system in 2018 including 13 company operated in 12 franchise restaurants this compares to 20 openings in 2017 and only 13 in 2016 we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing both in terms of more openings and the expanding geographic breadth of our openings as 10 states had openings in 2018 and we expect openings in 14 states during 2019 our franchise acceleration has been particularly encouraging and has been enabled by strengthening our franchise foundation through enhancements and investments in recent years to position franchising as a pillar of our growth strategy and fourth we successfully rolled out elevated combined solutions the latest iteration of our brand strategy to further our mission to be the leader in the value oriented qsr segment it included brand catalysts and operational improvements to elevate our brand positioning through a deeper focus on our fresh preparation quality attributes and of course hospitality we also work to further strengthen our great culture with the launch of our new advertising campaign centered on real employees highlighting our freshly prepared ingredients and qsr positioning by celebrating the hardest working hands in fast food regarding q4 itself we extended our track record of comparable restaurant sales growth to 21 consecutive quarters to the del taco system with a 1 9 increase and to 26 quarters for a company operated restaurants with a 1 increase average check growth in company operated restaurants was 4 9 including over 1 of menu mix growth although transactions declined to 3 9 franchised comparable restaurant sales grew 3 2 again outpacing company operated restaurants we also increased our restaurant contribution margin by 40 basis points to 20 3 and our adjusted ebitda by 0 3 million to 23 6 million finally we had 15 systemwide openings consisting of seven company operated in eight franchised restaurants q4 marks the return of a fan favorite premium limited time offer protein shredded beef which has not been on the menu since 2012 shredded beef included mid tier and premium products to provide a great value and a quality food experience designed to elevate the brand we paired that lto with additional new product news around epic burritos with the launch of the new triple meat epic burrito featuring freshly grilled steak chicken and bacon these promotions help to drive over 1 of menu mix growth and a q4 premium mix that exceeded 10 turning to our 2019 plans we re focused on driving traffic momentum profitably through a series of strategic initiatives using a phased approach this starts with our digital transformation through our new app and expanded third party delivery followed by enhancements to our core value program and delivering exciting new products designed to generate incremental occasions let me start with our digital transformation progress last november we launched our new app as a key pillar of our crm development strategy our initial focus is to provide offers to build our database which is now eclipsed 400 000 registered users since november we are encouraged by the early momentum of this marketing platform and a long term opportunity it provides us to drive guest frequency as it scales we expanded our delivery initiative as well during the first quarter by launching grubhub delivery and substantially all company operated del toco locations we believe a multiple dsp approach will optimize driver coverage to maximize consumer demand and we expect to launch both doordash and postmates later this year while we continue to leverage the buck change feature of buck under to provide pricing flexibility we are also enhancing our value platform with the recent launch of fresh faves boxes fresh faves addresses growing consumer demand for abundant value and better positions us to meet value oriented guests needs these are full meal deals with two or three entrees french fries and a drink designed to deliver best in class abundant value and variety that differentiates del toco from the competition that differentiation really starts with our pricing approach by offering 4 5 and 6 options which provides the consumer great choice the new fresh face boxes will work in concert with buck under and buck change to offer expansive value ranging from all the card items to bundled meal deals underpinning the launch of fresh faves boxes is our seasonal seafood promotion featuring our popular jumbo shrimp limited time offer and two beer battered fish tacos for just 4 made with hand cut sustainable wild caught alaska pollock in a crispy beer batter it sounds delicious finally we plan to leverage innovation to drive incremental occasions with the launch of the beyond taco and beyond avocado taco during the second quarter the growing guest demand for vegan vegetarian options created an opportunity for us to partnered with beyond meat to be the first mexican qsr chain to develop a proprietary blend of seasoned 100 plant based protein that taste similar to our current ground beef we have tested beyond meat in selected restaurants in greater la our entire san diego market and more recently in all oklahoma restaurants the response on social media and the results have been impressive increasing both check and traffic as many new or lapsed users and regular del taco fans visit our restaurants eager to sample something innovative which delivers on the better for united states we believe this program will drive sales while further strengthening our qsr brand position currently our first quarter system wide comparable restaurant sales trends to date are running slightly negative and below our prior expectations as expressed in mid january this outcome is influenced by the anticipated shift of lent which began three weeks later this year and adversely impacts q1 due to our very popular seasonal seafood promotion as well as the unanticipated extremely cold and wet weather we have experienced in california and throughout the west looking forward the expected combination of normalized weather and the favorable reversal of the lent shift in the second quarter is expected to sequentially improve same store sales across our system particularly our strategic initiatives kick in and transaction compares ease lastly i wanted to reiterate our portfolio optimization strategy which is designed to help grow auvs and stimulate new unit development by shifting our portfolio mix to 55 franchised by summer 2020 our company operated footprint will predominantly reflect strong auvs and restaurant margins in our core western market plus a strategic presence in our emerging markets we expect this to also drive a sharpened operational focus and financial benefits including improved company auvs and restaurant margins reductions in returning existing unit capital and reduced exposure to cost side inflation in california concentration in the first quarter we acquired three high volume franchised restaurants and sold 13 lower volume units in the la area to existing multi unit del taco franchise groups these transactions are expected to optimize these restaurants for auv growth and also we will consider buying or selling other restaurants in our core la market nothing further is planned at this time we also plan to refranchise our core our non core western markets to help stimulate development as we begin to solve for the common prospective franchisee desire to buy then build we have no additional updates at this time other than to say that the process will proceed with a focus on transacting with the buyers who are most likely to deliver on their growth commitments we remain confident they can all be refranchised by next summer 2020 over time the net proceeds from such refranchising may help fund new companies seed markets enabling co development or adjacent franchise growth opportunities and other efficiencies in closing there are a lot of exciting things happening at del taco our digital value and innovation strategies will serve as important catalysts for sales growth and as always we plan to complement our top line initiatives with effective margin management and now steve will review our q4 financials and full year guidance for 2019 steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john total fourth quarter revenue rose 7 3 to 157 3 million from 146 5 million in the year ago fourth quarter and included 4 1 million of franchise advertising

the del taco system is now generated 21 consecutive quarters of positive same store sales fourth quarter company restaurant sales increased 4 4 to 146 7 million from 140 6 million in the year ago period this increase was driven by contributions from additional company operated stores as compared to the fourth quarter of last year along with company operated comparable restaurant sales growth of 1 fourth quarter company operated comparable restaurant sales growth represents the 26th consecutive quarter of gains and was comprised of a 4 9 increase in check including over 1 in positive menu mix partially offset by a 3 9 decline in transactions franchise revenue increased 7 year over year to 5 3 million from 5 0 million last year the increase was driven by a franchise comparable restaurant sales growth of 3 2 other franchise revenue related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules and additional franchise operating stores as compared to the fourth quarter of last year turning to our expense item s food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales have decreased approximately 40 basis points year over year to 27 4 from 27 8 this was driven by many price increases partially offset by modest food inflation including increased distribution costs we also experienced slight margin pressure from our shredded beef and epic triple meat promotions which feature is slightly lower than typical margin percentage labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased approximately 40 basis points to 31 6 from 32 this was driven by lower payroll taxes due to the elimination of the federal unemployment payroll tax surcharge on california wages that was retroactively eliminated in november of 2018 for the entire 2018 tax year the favorable impact from this payroll tax elimination was 26 basis points for fiscal 2018 which was entirely realized during the fiscal fourth quarter we expect to retain this permanent lower rate prospectively occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased by approximately 30 basis points to 20 6 from 20 3 last year the 30 basis points of deleverage was due to inflationary pressure within this category that outpaced our modest same store sales gain of 1 based on its performance restaurant contribution was 29 8 million compared to 28 0 million in the prior year an increase of 6 5 restaurant contribution margin increased approximately 40 basis points to 20 3 from 19 9 general and administrative expenses were 13 4 million and as a percentage of total revenue increased by approximately 100 basis points year over year to 8 5 this increase was driven by increased legal and related expenses performance based management incentive compensation stock based compensation expense incremental sox 404 b compliance costs and the expense side of the other franchise revenue that is now reported on a gross basis as well as lower than expected revenues which magnified the percentage adjusted ebitda increase 1 2 to 23 6 million from 23 3 million last year as a percentage of total revenues adjusted ebitda decreased 90 basis points to 15 from 15 9 last year depreciation and amortization expense increased 9 6 to 8 2 million compared to 7 5 million last year with the increase driven by the addition of new assets as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization rose 10 basis points to 5 2 interest expense was 3 1 million compared to 2 4 million last year the increase was due to an increased one month libor rate and a higher average outstanding revolver balance compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as of the end of the fourth quarter we had 159 million outstanding under our revolver and our applicable margin for libor loans remained at 1 75 the income tax expense was 2 1 million during the fourth quarter for an effective tax rate of 27 1 as compared to a 24 8 million benefit during 2017 which included a one time income tax benefit as a result of the recent tax reform excluding this one time benefit the prior year rate would have been 41 6 and the lower effective tax rate is due to the impact of the recent tax reform net income for the fourth quarter was 5 6 million or 0 15 per diluted share compared to 35 2 million or 0 89 per diluted share last year in addition we are reporting adjusted net income which excludes impairment of long lived assets restaurant closure charges and other income related to insurance proceeds adjusted net income in the quarter was 7 0 million or 0 18 per diluted share compared to 6 2 million or 0 16 per diluted share last year turning now to our repurchase program covering common stock and warrants during the quarter we repurchased 765 209 shares of common stock at an average price of 11 05 per share and 20 596 warrants at an average price per warrant of a 1 93 for an aggregate of 8 5 million at fiscal year end approximately 29 6 million remained under the 75 million authorization i should add that during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 we have remain active when we repurchased approximately 200 000 shares in over 830 000 warrants so far this year one balance sheet point is the presentation of the held for sale captioned in current assets to reflect the carrying value of property and equipment sold in connection with the 13 unit refranchised transaction during the first quarter as well as own property for three new restaurants open in 2018 that we expect the sale leaseback in 2019 two such sale leaseback transactions were finalized in the first quarter the sale leaseback proceeds helped to net down our capital expenditures to align with our capital guidance that is provided on a net basis whereas our gaap presentation uses a gross basis before covering our fiscal year 2019 annual guidance i want to discuss the new lease accounting standard that is effective at the start of fiscal 2019 and how it is expected to impact our balance sheet and p l upon adoption all existing build to suit leases will become operating leases and we will be recognized all the existing doordash assets and deemed landlord financing liabilities going forward substantially all restaurants will be operating leases to be accounted for on the balance sheet we expect to recognize operating lease liabilities of approximately 220 million to 240 million and right of use assets of approximately 210 million to 230 million from a p l perspective there is no material change to our accounting for existing operating leases however the accounting for our prior build to suit leases will impact several key expense lines primarily occupancy and other operating expenses or build to suit leases will now be reported the expenses for these leases were previously reported in depreciation and interest expense this reclassification is expected to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 70 basis points on our restaurant contribution margin and adjusted ebitda and has been incorporated into our annual guidance it is important to note that this change is non cash expected to be net income neutral and does not reflect any underlying economic changes in performance in terms of guidance we are reiterating what we issued in january revised for the new lease accounting standard where appropriate and are furnishing several additional key metrics our top line expectations are unchanged including low single digit systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth with total revenue between 517 million and 527 million and company restaurants sales between 481 million and 491 million we continue to expect menu pricing of up to 4 to help mitigate the impact of food inflation of approximately 2 to 3 including higher distribution and transportation costs and labor inflation of approximately 6 primarily driven by 1 increase in california minimum wage general and administrative expenses between approximately 8 7 at 9 of total revenue this range reflects a plateau compared to 2018 in light of our first quarter refranchising activity which created an estimated 15 basis point increase as the g a savings from this transaction cannot be offset on a percentage basis given the reduction in restaurant sales with the aforementioned new lease accounting rules we revised our restaurant contribution margin expectations by 70 basis points to between 18 1 and 18 6 we also revised our adjusted ebitda estimate by the same of 70 basis points from the new lease accounting rules and we now expect between 66 5 million and 69 0 million the interest expense was now expected between 7 2 million and 7 6 million which represents the recent fourth quarter annualized run rate less approximately 2 6 million due to the new lease accounting rules which will now be recorded and operating in other expenses effective tax rate of approximately 26 5 to 27 5 diluted earnings per share of approximately 0 47 to 0 52 at least 25 systemwide new unit openings on a gross basis skewing toward franchise restaurants and an estimated 1 system wide closure rate and finally net capital expenditures of approximately 42 million to 47 million including approximately 18 million to 20 million for new unit construction approximately 14 million to 15 million to maintain or enhance existing restaurants and approximately 10 million to 12 million for discretionary investment including a remodel program test and technology investments such as mobile ordering and delivery drive through enhancements to improve throughput and learning management and workforce management upgrades to drive operational efficiencies with that we thank you for your interest in del taco and we are happy to answer any questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of alex slagle with jefferies please proceed with your question alex slagle jefferies analyst hey guys thanks for the question just wonder if you could provide additional perspective on the plan refranchising strategy and frame up what the range of outcomes might look like in terms of timing and potential impact on operating results in 2019 john d cappasola president and chief executive officer hey alex it s john let me start with the strategy here and now we re thinking about that and let steve kind of lend a bit on in your impact so clearly on a the franchising refranchising peers there s two components one which is really kind of falling under our portfolio optimization umbrella is what we did most recently that were the deals that were completed here in q1 2019 that was the 13 units that we refranchise to three local franchises in the la market that we feel really good about giving them the opportunity to turn these restaurants into a big win and they have a proven capability of doing that and some other acquisitions that they have done within our systems who are excited for them and excited about what they can do with these units and obviously we saw the opportunity too also acquire three franchise restaurants to company because these were in territories where the company operations was very strong so as i said you know as i said we don t have any plans to do anything further in that area but we re going to be very opportunistic in regards to portfolio optimization where it makes sense we re looking at other opportunities as we go down the road the other big component that we talked about obviously was the refranchising of non core western markets and a little bit different part of the strategy one that as we said has not been fully activated yet and there s no set timeline on that other than we d like to get all the markets done by the summer of 2020 so we re in process of evaluating right now and trying to make the best decisions there with the ultimate focus being let s partner with either existing or new franchisees that can deliver on growth and that s really kind of the thrust of that part of the strategy let me just throw it over to steve to see if it has any color on the impact of the 13 divestitures steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that has definitely been factored into our q1 guidance you know that is the purchase of 13 stores sales of three stores you know as we ve said a couple of months ago that we ll have an accretive impact to earnings has been fully reflected inside of our guidance however the non core markets in the west has not yet been factored into our guidance you know for now there s no specific update on timing other than to say you know there will be a process moving forward with a big focus on making sure we transact with the buyer or buyers most likely buyers who will most likely deliver on the growth commitments that will be part and parcel with those expected transactions alex slagle jefferies analyst got it and to what extent of you identified future new markets that you want to seed john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah we re in the process so we ve been evaluating several markets and we re not ready to announce anything just yet but i would say that we re getting we re getting close and realizing that you know what we re doing down in the southeast is actually a very viable strategy to move forward with in another territory or two so we ll make that decision here you know in the near future and we ll make sure that we you know we update everyone as appropriate alex slagle jefferies analyst and then just the last follow up if you had an estimate on the magnitude of the weather impact you saw in the first quarter and maybe any other views on the underlying momentum you see in business with the recent value efforts with the mixed two and recently the fresh faves boxes steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john touched on certainly adverse impacts q1 in the west very wet very cold as john said both company and system right now are slightly negative it s not a perfect calculation but had we experienced normalized weather we believe we would apply to slightly positive for company in system as well so maybe that percentage area of swing due to the weather alex slagle jefferies analyst thanks operator our next question comes from the line of craig bibb with cjs securities please proceed with your question craig bibb cjs securities analyst just maybe i ll just quickly follow up on that in terms like including the impact of weather quarter to date which is like a week left in the quarter you re running like a minus 5 almost in traffic is that do you have 4 prior to steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yes you re in the ballpark the traffic for the first quarter will be sequentially lower than the 3 9 ph that we experienced in the fourth quarter so in that 5 plus area is a good has to make although there is nine days left to go craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay and your kind of you re pushing 4 price which is aggressive and needed if you re confident that there s nothing push back there john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes i mean craig it s john so so far all of our internal analysis and the work that we ve done with our econometric modelling firm just continues to indicate that these pricing actions have been accretive and you know that said you can impact traffic to some degree when you take some level of pricing but the answer right now for us is i think overall it s been accretive for us and the focus now is let s really execute well our transaction momentum strategy which we believe as we assess the business coming out of elevated combined solutions mid last year we understood there were some it can be a conclusion there were some gaps that we needed to address on the digital front as well as some enhancements we can make to our value platform and then some exciting new news we needed to bring to the table and we had that and beyond meat that will be coming soon so i think all and we re ok with our pricing strategy we re going to continue to watch it and watch the market very closely and see what the competition is doing and measure it but we don t think that it s having a adverse impact a massively adverse impact to traffic at this point steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer and two other things we do there craig we consistently regularly measure or monitor our value and affordability perception ratings performed mpt grou we continue to be very strong both of those attributes so that s an important part of our thought process then also reading the competitive landscape it s certainly a level playing field in our view when it comes to wage and we definitely observe a lot of accelerated price happening out there in the marketplace you know most of our markets certainly in california by our peers as well craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay and lastly of the 400 00 app downloads sounds like a lot relative to your response to your store base do you know how it compares to your peers and do you have a goal for where you want to be and are they buying more or less than your average customer steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i d say you know our strategy going into this year was obviously use offers to build a database so that we could pivot coming out of 2019 to either a deeper loyalty program or really starts to leverage scale this platform so you know when we came into the year our focus was really around building the database and getting registered users up that was our number one goal and what we had put out there internally was that we wanted to you know we believed we could achieve somewhere in the high six figure range i d love to see us achieve somewhere just right over seven figures if we can and that s certainly what the team s doing of course we re ramping up quickly we re at about 700 registered users per store right now and as you know as you move through time it probably will become a little bit more difficult to register folks but i could see us in the high in a high six figure range maybe low seven figure range this year and what s important with that is you know obviously we are giving these folks reasons to come back to del toco on a weekly basis where we re looking at their activity we re sending them targeted offers and over time as that database becomes bigger it ll be easier for us to be more certain in regards to how we can move the needle on the same store sales side of the business so over time it s a crm platform but right now it s about building that database craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay thanks a lot john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah thanks operator our next question comes from the line of jeremy hamblin with dougherty co please proceed with your question jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst hi thanks i want to start by coming back to the labor comments and the payroll taxes for q4 i think you if i caught this right 26 basis points for fiscal 18 in total does that imply that it was roughly 100 basis points for the year i m sorry 100 basis point impact for q4 what was the the impact steve for q4 on that particular item the benefit steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer the 26 basis points for the year it could drive just over 1 2 million which would be about 83 basis points for the fiscal fourth quarter so looking at that line item the leverage of 40 basis points you know absent that positive news from california file would have been deleverage of 40 to 50 basis points in the full year would have deleveraged probably 40 basis points rather than the 10 basis points that we reported so a bit of a one time good guy in some respects but very positively it is a permanent relief if you will that rate has permanently gone away so it is a benefit that we will carry forward into future years jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst understood and as i think about your guidance for 6 wage inflation this year and how that compared to 2018 one of the factors as we think about that labor line item that s been a hurdle for a while how we should be thinking about that this year do you expect maybe slightly higher impact to that line item in total in 2019 steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer we think the 6 estimate is solid so we have 1 of wage increase this year last year there was 0 50 so last year the original guide was 4 to 5 and we landed that inflation rate somewhere in that mid 4 area so we do feel good about the 6 this year every extra dollar becomes a little bit less proportionately and unfortunately things that are more fixed in nature the agm salaries health insurance as well as workers compensation have all trended in a much less inflationary manner so it allows us to kind of net that all down to more of that msd type rate that right now we see at 6 for 2019 jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst got it thanks and then wanted to ask a question on g a moving forward so after we get through the refranchising effort and you see some normalization you continue to see your g a line item grow as a percent of sales over the last several years you mentioned it plateauing this year how can we be thinking about that now as you go from 55 to 45 company owned locations as we look forward is that something where g a it s popping out and potentially could even be lower on an absolute basis with 10 fewer location steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer sure good question yeah near term for 2019 as i mentioned kind of pro forma for that first quarter refranchising activity you know that itself causes about 15 bps of pressure so the 2018 prior ph would have otherwise been reported around 8 8 so the guide for the year ahead of 8 7 to 9 more or less colors at outcome so we are in essence flat telling this year and the midpoint reflects about 5 5 dollar inflation year on year which is more reflective of the very lower unemployment inflationary environment that we re in so that s what we re expecting for the year ahead as far as getting into our refranchising of the non core markets that you know will happen over time as those happen we ll be very careful to give you a very good update and guidance on what will happen you know restaurant level royalties as well as the g a impact so without a doubt as you refranchise larger numbers of restaurants there certainly is you know i ll call it variable g a you know the above store leader who usually runs 8 to 12 stores is a great example you know those cuts will be made and essentially transfer to the franchisees when they happened but naturally ph there is a large drop in restaurant sales as well as revenues so you know over time if this happened we ll try to bring more color into what the percent of revenue will do it may actually take up somewhat but you know as we are maybe more important is what is the dollar inflation year over year in light of what we need to manage the business naturally we need to saw lot of restaurants a lot of those needs do go down so we ll be very focused on you know taking those variable g a cost of our p l as those restaurant refranchise transactions happen and giving good color on what that then translates to on a percent of revenue basis as we move forward jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst thanks for taking the questions good luck john d cappasola president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of peter saleh with btig please proceed with your question peter saleh btig analyst great thank you and thanks for taking the question guys i want to ask about the refranchising and how franchisees are thinking about their capital i guess not just this year but going forward as the franchisees absorb some of these company units over the course of the next year 18 months do we think about you know that any sort of acceleration in new unit development as a system to get pushed out to 2021 and beyond you know maybe as franchisees are absorbing some of these units is this going to limit the amount of capital they have to put into new unit gross openings going forward steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer you see peter i wouldn t say that would be the case i mean how we re thinking about this is it s a combination of new and existing franchisees is instead we re definitely looking to bring some new blood into the system that can leverage a base of company operations to get really competent on the brand very quickly and then pivot obviously into growth and that s going to be the real catalysts of selling these markets so whether it s a new franchisee or an existing franchisee their ability to move and deliver on a growth agreement that s material for us so the idea there is to spur new unit growth specifically franchise growth peter saleh btig analyst so are all the refranchise units or all the deals together planning to put together over the course of the next year or so they come with required sort of new unit build going forward in those markets with the franchisees john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes absolutely growth will be a big part of the sale process and that ll be really one of the driving pieces for us in regards to divesting these units but it won t necessarily be just in the markets growth in the markets that they currently reside in there may also be adjacent growth or new territories attached to that so again these are folks that are likely going to be sophisticated franchisees some of them may have multi state operations some of them may not but either way we would expect to be able to attach some level of agreement to it that would be either within the existing market or outside of the market tbd ph dependent on the groups and the attractiveness of the groups that we take a lot of look at here over the next couple of quarters peter saleh btig analyst great and then just my last question is i think you guys mentioned the addition of couple more third party aggregators doordash and postmates later this year can i just talk about that decision why you decided to move forward with more partners and what exactly is entailed to add these partners is it more tech investment are they making the tech investment what needs to be done to further integrate these other delivery partners steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i mean what we talked about in the past is really our strategy on delivery is we believe a multi year delivery service provider approach is the best way for us to kind of break through and optimize consumer demand once we got our heads around the economic model associated with delivery which for us we ve talked about the kind of the big pillars for us were check average is what we re seeing so far with our launch is nearly 2x so the store level checkout inaudible there s a lot of as far as us a lot of as far as room to play with on the margin dollars side and also we wanted to be able to do premium pricing and we are doing now we tested that and we found that at a reasonable level it was the consumer was willing to pay it because of that convenience additional convenience suit been able to get del taco delivered to your doorstep so we ve activated that so that s helped us so the economic model we feel really good about so now it s about let s get as much demand as we can and what we saw on our test is that as we layered on the multi delivery service providers we actually saw step ups in the in some units in the actual delivery rate that we were seeing at these restaurants so we like that approach we think every trader is a little bit different every market is a little bit different and the breadth of having the three dsps and that s grubhub postmates and doordash activated together is important to us the other component i would only mention is you know we absolutely want to have pos integration we found through our test that you know the tablet approach in having tablets laying around the restaurant wasn t very conducive to an efficient and seamless transaction for our operators and it was actually hurting overall satisfaction from a perspective of order accuracy so if pos integration is done for us is actually we ve seen overall satisfaction scores in some cases surpass what we see through or drive through in dining experience so we ve removed that order accuracy issue because you know with the stand alone tablet that employee is actually having the key and the order manually to the pos and we don t want that to have to happen so pos integration is really important and we re leveraging existing technology that we have in our restaurants today along with some new technology features that come along with platforms like we although brings to the table to make sure that we have integration peter saleh btig analyst great thank you very much very helpful john d cappasola president and chief executive officer you got it operator our next question comes from the line of joshua long with piper jaffray please proceed with your question joshua long piper jaffray analyst great thank you for taking my question i wanted to circle back to some of the comments you mentioned about moving into more states year over year and just curious on how you re thinking about driving brand awareness or maybe leveraging some of the new platforms and tools that you have this year versus 2018 to make sure you re really getting the most leverage out of everything in driving awareness of the brand john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah great question josh our playbook that we ve developed over the last several years which has really helped us to perform across our diverse geographic footprint within our franchise base certainly it is a very local market driven approach to trying to own the four walls and inaudible we so we call it being best on block and it starts with combined solutions obviously that s our overarching strategy that is to make sure that we are absolutely focused on guest metrics operating metrics and people metrics at the restaurant level to drive our performance so when the marketing comes in we re going to able to deliver on that promise so having really solid operations underneath us being best on block is an absolute driver of our performance the other piece is obviously getting ourselves into good real estate so you know we want to make sure especially as we getting into a market that may be considered more an emerging market or a state where we don t quite have the level of brand awareness picking the right sites and getting into the right straight areas are critical and you know that kind of two things working together we ve talked about this over time we really see success like what we ve seen over the years in a market like michigan and what we re starting to see down in the southeast is pick the right real estate with the right operating model and mindset and you can win and then obviously we do a lot on the local marketing side we don t have national advertising to fall back on so typical to kind of who we are as a brand we re very scrappy and as the combined solutions is all about so we do a lot of local marketing digital advertising we try to get involved in the trade area and the communities around the trade area and we want franchisees that have that belief and willingness to do that as well so that s been some of the key things that we ve seen that we set ourselves up for that have helped the brand in some of these newer markets over the last few years joshua long piper jaffray analyst very helpful color i appreciate that when thinking about some of your commentary about how trends improved sequentially you mentioned the comparison and obviously we can see that as well just curious of that was more of a back half of your comment knowing that comparisons do materially ease the 3q 4q period if you felt confident enough in the initiatives and some of the new mini platforms you have for them to start being more of a contributor here into 2q in the first half the year as well john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes i mean i think the way to think about it is as these big transitory headwinds start to subside weather and lent offset which we ve been very transparent about and talked about on this call today i think we re poised for same store sales improvements in q2 and i think you should expect some further acceleration as the year goes on and we implement both the transaction momentum strategy but also this compare start to ease specifically in q3 and q4 so i think when you look at the transaction momentum strategy we ve gotten the second phase out the door now in the last couple of weeks with fresh faves boxes beyond meat is about to come toward the back end of the april so right within q2 and we feel really good about those platforms being on transaction momentum drivers for the brand joshua long piper jaffray analyst okay that s exactly what i was looking for i appreciate that context and then last one for me in terms of some of the discretionary spending you highlighted in the capex bucket curious if there s anything you could talk about in terms of the remodel test that you outlined or maybe some of the other upgrades around operations and operational efficiency i m sure it s still early and you re testing a lot of things that try to really be getting the specific details but just curious can you give us a sense of where some of those dollars or what some of the projects you re thinking about could be down the road john d cappasola president and chief executive officer sure good question josh so certainly we did touch on our plans to have a remodeled test program during 2019 we always looking to make sure we understand what the right design and look feel of that next generation remodel looks like during this year go there being to optimize that program look at the return profile and then beyond 2019 we ll be in a position to talk about more of the likely acceleration of that on a longer term basis other exciting things kind of discretionary uses of capital certainly technology investments ranging from you know investment to further operationalize and roll out things like mobile ordering as well as expanding delivery some drive through technology enhancements to help improve throughput at the drive through and other investments in both learning management and workforce management systems that help drive operational efficiencies long term so a number of items going on there that we re pretty optimistic about steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer one other thing i wanted to just add because i think it s a good point and color and context in regards to you know setting ourselves up for success within the four walls with combined solutions is we ve got nearly 450 restaurants today that have rolled out the new two tier warning devices which we re excited about some of you guys may have seen those in our restaurants we ve talked about them a bit so that innovation is going to provide a real quality and consistency within our operations we have 250 million products sold annually in the two tire del taco and we want them to be hot so this device really improves throughput for us because it s been a bottleneck for us in the past while also improving quality for our guests so that s another piece that we re excited about and our operators and franchisees are really getting on board with an excited about as well joshua long piper jaffray analyst great thank you for taking my question today john d cappasola president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of nick setyan with wedbush securities please proceed with your question nick setyan wedbush securities analyst thank you my question is on the third party delivery i mean so far have you guys been happy relatively through your expectations around the economics are you seeing that attach rates turn into the higher margin items like sodas kind of in line with your original expectations you know aside from obviously the top line impact you know what the margin impact any just kind of any color around the early learnings would be helpful is there any kind of way to think about you know to what extent it s benefiting makes but it s impacting transactions as a shifting individual people into maybe bigger groups john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah nick these are all great questions i can answer every single one of them right now sitting here today as we re in the middle and we just kind of finished up our full roll out here with grubhub and we re learning each and every day so far what i d say about the volume is you know as we kind of expected was on an overall average it s relatively low right now but you know we are seeing some locations that are significantly outperforming and we think that as we move forward we believe the performance is going to continue to get better and there is going to be further demand driven you know a couple of things are gonna help out one is really in just this quarter we just started the marketing around it and each promotion you re going to see more marketing related to grubhub delivery in the markets that we are offering in and as doordash and postmates come on you ll see marketing around that s so driving brand awareness is going to be a key piece for us as we move forward and then obviously the other piece that s going to help create some more demand on the delivery front is going to be adding the additional few providers so right now it is a single provider that we re using really with grubhub outside there are some tests that we re doing with doordash and once doordash comes on and postmates come on on full system now you ve got the full suite if you will really helping us to drive demand and we would expect performance to improve so i would say as we move forward on the transactional front or the demand front that should get better and get stronger as we move through times as we move through time for the reasons that we outlined and just in regard to the overall mix check listen you know the check average like i said is about to 2x right now that what we re experiencing in our restaurants compared to what we re seeing on the delivery front we kind of anticipated that would happen so it s nice to see that what we saw on test markets is fairly similar and we feel good about that and we feel good that we re not getting a lot of pushback on the incremental pricing that we ve put out thus far like i said the overall satisfaction associated with delivery transactions actually rivals to that of our drive through and our dining room right now so steve any color you want to add on on the margin front steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the 2x check helps create some margin efficiencies if you will things like the credit card fee wipes are on the dsp not us and the premium pricing that s not the whole commission but you know a very good chunk of it those all can go a long way to neutralize any potential adverse margin percentage impact so we feel good about that so at this point about scaling the first two and three in the later this year we ll have a better for overall velocity and what how it kind of ramps up as it becomes more material as the year progresses nick setyan wedbush securities analyst got it and a similar question on the app we ve gotten a lot of reports from others that maybe it s not necessary driving our transactions and it is putting pressure on mix what s been the early experience so far with the app john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes i mean like i said we re 400 000 registered users almost 700 registered users per restaurant the way you think about probably margin management on this nick is in the long term as crm kicks in we believe this can become very creative obviously in the long term you re thinking about you can start to target to an individual user to spur behavior that you wouldn t have otherwise received right so it becomes incremental on transactions that you re driving right now we re in build the database load and let s do that through offers so that we can get to the point that we can use crm so in the short term as we think about 2019 well what we re really doing is we re managing the discount rate across the business right so we have other discounts that are happening in our business whether it be email marketing or print marketing that we do out and some of our markets for coupons are offered local store marketing efforts that field marketing uses so whether we ve asked marketing to do is really rationalize some of that existing discount that is in our margin line already or baked in to pivot that over to or transition that over to the mobile app as we know that we re going to have to invest a bit to get this thing up and running right so what you saw in our guidance that steve provided was that we modeled that fully out within our guidance range and that kind of horse trading that s occurring between you know the different marketing avenues right now and obviously we played our cards right we re able to manage the margin in the short run while we build the database which provides a bigger opportunity down the road operator our next question comes from the line of steven anderson with maxim group please proceed with your question steven anderson maxim group analyst yes good afternoon just want to ask about some of the menu news you have forthcoming address value most recently mostly in the middle of the menu bar bell last year you did the lower end of that barbell so actually if you having is coming toward the higher end i know you had the plateaus come out coming up against the two and three year anniversary of that and just want to see if you have any news forthcoming on that later this year john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah so i said beyond meat is definitely in what we re thinking about beyond taco that s definitely more in that kind of inaudible premium range of our menu strategy steven so we feel really excited about what the opportunity is with beyond and you know obviously one of the things we wanted to do here was tap into that better for unique state to really help to further differentiate del taco as a qsr plus brand but we also believe it s going to drive incremental sales by attracting a user that maybe a new user or a lapsed user and we ve seen through our tests that it s also applicable to existing users so the consumer opportunity is immense and it s exciting and we think that activating that platform more in that mid tier and premium range is absolutely appropriate it will literally be when you think about the accessibility to a product like this the del taco is going to create there is no one else doing it in our category at the price point that we re about to offer so that s where our ability to do that and create accessibility at a lower price point than what you re seeing from others in mexican qsr particularly but across the category is we re pretty excited about steven anderson maxim group analyst that s reiterated you ve have seen for beyond meat you re seeing increase traffic as well as ticket john d cappasola president and chief executive officer traffic and check gross yes steven anderson maxim group analyst yes thank you john d cappasola president and chief executive officer thank you operator we have reached all the time we have for questions and i would like to turn the call back to john cappasola for closing remarks john d cappasola president and chief executive officer all right everyone well thank you for joining us today and spending time with us on the brand we appreciate your interest in del taco and we look

after galloping along for the past two years the global economy is showing signs of weakening with the united states china and europe all facing the rising threat of a slowdown few economists foresee an outright global recession within the next year but the synchronized growth that powered most major economies since 2017 appears to be fading the risks have been magnified by the trade war raging between the united states and china the strife dividing britain over an exit from the european union and the federal reserve s continuing interest rate hikes it s all been enough to contribute to a broad retreat in global stock markets counting tuesday s deep losses u s stock indexes once up around 10 percent for the year have surrendered all their 2018 gains the fed is expected next month to raise its key short term rate for the fourth time this year the central bank s rate hikes help control inflation but they also make loans costlier for consumers and businesses and for countries that borrowed in u s dollars the fed s hikes make debts harder to bear argentina for one has slid into recession as its cost of repaying its debt has surged we can t continue to grow this fast for much longer without risking inflation adrian cooper chief executive of oxford economics said of the still solid u s economy that s ultimately what the fed is trying to achieve with its steady movement in interest rates the skill is to do so in ways that don t create a big downturn the concerns have grown enough that larry kudlow president donald trump s top economic adviser on tuesday dismissed the worries roiling the markets recession is so far in the distance i can t see it kudlow told a group of reporters outside the white house keep the faith it s a very strong economy the collective growth of the world s major economies in the past two years was broadly welcomed after a feeble recovery from the 2008 financial crises yet few economists saw accelerated growth as sustainable or even desirable over several years the concern is that a prolonged global expansion could ignite inflation or speculative investing that would inevitably send vulnerable economies into a downturn compounding the challenge the world s economies are linked more than ever through trade finance and investment to the point that a rupture in one major nation tends to spread across the globe oxford economics predicts that the growth of the global economy as measured by its gross domestic product will slip from 3 1 percent this year to 2 8 in 2019 such a slowdown is enough to crimp corporate profits and business investment cooper said still most american and european workers probably wouldn t feel the pain he said in part because of a resilient job market and lower oil prices 2019 is still going to look pretty good your job is going to be safe and your wages are going to rise cooper predicted while adding that he thinks the slowdown will worsen in 2020 in the meantime though stock markets have endured waves of jittery selling as investors have tried to factor in a slowdown that could depress the growth of company profits financial markets have become a little more volatile and anxious of late worried about slowing global growth trade tensions brexit woes and concerns that the u s may not be able to sustain its current cyclical sweet spot said josh feinman chief economist at deutsche asset management over the next two years most forecasts suggest that u s growth after cresting above 3 percent this year its best performance since 2005 will weaken fed chair jerome powell acknowledged in a speech last week that the strong worldwide growth of 2017 is in retreat you see signs of a gradual slowdown powell said goldman sachs foresees annual u s growth slowing to 1 75 percent by the end of 2019 the predicted weakening stems in part from the front loaded stimulus of the tax cuts trump pushed through congress the boost from the tax overhaul is expected to wane by 2020 one continuing threat for the u s economy is trump s trade war with china the president has imposed a 10 percent tax on 200 billion of chinese goods a tariff that s set to escalate to 25 percent in 2019 he s also threatened to add tariffs on 250 billion more in chinese goods a prolonged trade crisis would depress the global exchange of goods and therefore economic growth trump is set to meet with president xi jinping at a group of 20 international meeting in argentina next week but prospects for a breakthrough seem to have dimmed both countries appear to be far apart on the trade dispute and unwilling to back down at this point said scott anderson chief economist at the bank of the west similarly political ruptures threaten to slow the pace of europe s five year expansion britain is struggling to finalize its exit from the european union and uncertainty surrounding prime minister theresa may s government has roiled markets in italy tensions have flared over a government that wants to increase its borrowing in defiance of rules about deficits among the 19 countries that share the euro currency mounting debt could cause italian interest rates to reach levels that would stifle growth and strain the eurozone yet the biggest risk of all might be china the world s second largest economy after the united states and the leading engine of global growth for several decades its economy was already cooling before trump raised tariffs in hopes of shrinking the u s trade gap with beijing and protecting u s technology among companies and economists the question isn t whether chinese growth will slow further it s how much in september year over year economic growth reached a post global crisis low of 6 5 percent this followed a regulatory clamp down on bank lending to curb surging debt forecasters expect the decline to deepen at least through mid 2019 the ruling communist party wants slower more self sustaining growth driven more by consumer spending and less by trade and investment but the slump has been sharper than expected in response beijing has cut taxes eased lending controls and pumped money into building projects october auto sales fell 13 percent from a year ago putting vehicle sales in china the industry s no 1 market on track to shrink this year for the first time in three decades housing sales and bank lending have dropped and spending on factories and other manufacturing assets has decelerated further action is needed to put a floor beneath economic growth julian evans pritchard of capital economics said in a report finding that floor could prove problematic if the trade war with the trump administration diminishes the exports that propelled china s economy to manufacturing dominance analysts at ubs put the likelihood as high as 20 percent that china could suffer a much sharper slowdown because of the escalating tensions with the united states in this environment contagion in global markets could not be avoided ubs analysts

strategic takeaways from 2018 as i believe they will provide great context for what we hope to accomplish this year first we achieved our sixth consecutive year of comparable restaurant sales growth across the del taco system with a 2 5 increase while our company operated restaurants generated a 1 5 increase franchise comparable restaurant sales grew at even faster rate of 3 8 which we view as indicative of our strengthening franchise system and del taco s brand portability across a diverse geographic footprint in fact franchise auvs have increased approximately 30 in the last five years across a 13 state footprint with more than half of these restaurants located outside of california our franchise momentum coupled with our non core western market refranchising strategy that i will discuss shortly is expected to stimulate development interest across existing and new franchisees to help expand del taco s brand reach second we hold our restaurant contribution margin steady at 19 7 demonstrating our effective margin management strategy despite only modest same store sales growth at company restaurants fiscal 2018 was our fourth consecutive year achieving a restaurant contribution margin of approximately 20 and we only recently achieved a 1 5 million auv margin management has become a strong confidency to del taco and is critically important during this extended inflationary cycle third we opened 25 restaurants across the del taco system in 2018 including 13 company operated in 12 franchise restaurants this compares to 20 openings in 2017 and only 13 in 2016 we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing both in terms of more openings and the expanding geographic breadth of our openings as 10 states had openings in 2018 and we expect openings in 14 states during 2019 our franchise acceleration has been particularly encouraging and has been enabled by strengthening our franchise foundation through enhancements and investments in recent years to position franchising as a pillar of our growth strategy and fourth we successfully rolled out elevated combined solutions the latest iteration of our brand strategy to further our mission to be the leader in the value oriented qsr segment it included brand catalysts and operational improvements to elevate our brand positioning through a deeper focus on our fresh preparation quality attributes and of course hospitality we also work to further strengthen our great culture with the launch of our new advertising campaign centered on real employees highlighting our freshly prepared ingredients and qsr positioning by celebrating the hardest working hands in fast food regarding q4 itself we extended our track record of comparable restaurant sales growth to 21 consecutive quarters to the del taco system with a 1 9 increase and to 26 quarters for a company operated restaurants with a 1 increase average check growth in company operated restaurants was 4 9 including over 1 of menu mix growth although transactions declined to 3 9 franchised comparable restaurant sales grew 3 2 again outpacing company operated restaurants we also increased our restaurant contribution margin by 40 basis points to 20 3 and our adjusted ebitda by 0 3 million to 23 6 million finally we had 15 systemwide openings consisting of seven company operated in eight franchised restaurants q4 marks the return of a fan favorite premium limited time offer protein shredded beef which has not been on the menu since 2012 shredded beef included mid tier and premium products to provide a great value and a quality food experience designed to elevate the brand we paired that lto with additional new product news around epic burritos with the launch of the new triple meat epic burrito featuring freshly grilled steak chicken and bacon these promotions help to drive over 1 of menu mix growth and a q4 premium mix that exceeded 10 turning to our 2019 plans we re focused on driving traffic momentum profitably through a series of strategic initiatives using a phased approach this starts with our digital transformation through our new app and expanded third party delivery followed by enhancements to our core value program and delivering exciting new products designed to generate incremental occasions let me start with our digital transformation progress last november we launched our new app as a key pillar of our crm development strategy our initial focus is to provide offers to build our database which is now eclipsed 400 000 registered users since november we are encouraged by the early momentum of this marketing platform and a long term opportunity it provides us to drive guest frequency as it scales we expanded our delivery initiative as well during the first quarter by launching grubhub delivery and substantially all company operated del toco locations we believe a multiple dsp approach will optimize driver coverage to maximize consumer demand and we expect to launch both doordash and postmates later this year while we continue to leverage the buck change feature of buck under to provide pricing flexibility we are also enhancing our value platform with the recent launch of fresh faves boxes fresh faves addresses growing consumer demand for abundant value and better positions us to meet value oriented guests needs these are full meal deals with two or three entrees french fries and a drink designed to deliver best in class abundant value and variety that differentiates del toco from the competition that differentiation really starts with our pricing approach by offering 4 5 and 6 options which provides the consumer great choice the new fresh face boxes will work in concert with buck under and buck change to offer expansive value ranging from all the card items to bundled meal deals underpinning the launch of fresh faves boxes is our seasonal seafood promotion featuring our popular jumbo shrimp limited time offer and two beer battered fish tacos for just 4 made with hand cut sustainable wild caught alaska pollock in a crispy beer batter it sounds delicious finally we plan to leverage innovation to drive incremental occasions with the launch of the beyond taco and beyond avocado taco during the second quarter the growing guest demand for vegan vegetarian options created an opportunity for us to partnered with beyond meat to be the first mexican qsr chain to develop a proprietary blend of seasoned 100 plant based protein that taste similar to our current ground beef we have tested beyond meat in selected restaurants in greater la our entire san diego market and more recently in all oklahoma restaurants the response on social media and the results have been impressive increasing both check and traffic as many new or lapsed users and regular del taco fans visit our restaurants eager to sample something innovative which delivers on the better for united states we believe this program will drive sales while further strengthening our qsr brand position currently our first quarter system wide comparable restaurant sales trends to date are running slightly negative and below our prior expectations as expressed in mid january this outcome is influenced by the anticipated shift of lent which began three weeks later this year and adversely impacts q1 due to our very popular seasonal seafood promotion as well as the unanticipated extremely cold and wet weather we have experienced in california and throughout the west looking forward the expected combination of normalized weather and the favorable reversal of the lent shift in the second quarter is expected to sequentially improve same store sales across our system particularly our strategic initiatives kick in and transaction compares ease lastly i wanted to reiterate our portfolio optimization strategy which is designed to help grow auvs and stimulate new unit development by shifting our portfolio mix to 55 franchised by summer 2020 our company operated footprint will predominantly reflect strong auvs and restaurant margins in our core western market plus a strategic presence in our emerging markets we expect this to also drive a sharpened operational focus and financial benefits including improved company auvs and restaurant margins reductions in returning existing unit capital and reduced exposure to cost side inflation in california concentration in the first quarter we acquired three high volume franchised restaurants and sold 13 lower volume units in the la area to existing multi unit del taco franchise groups these transactions are expected to optimize these restaurants for auv growth and also we will consider buying or selling other restaurants in our core la market nothing further is planned at this time we also plan to refranchise our core our non core western markets to help stimulate development as we begin to solve for the common prospective franchisee desire to buy then build we have no additional updates at this time other than to say that the process will proceed with a focus on transacting with the buyers who are most likely to deliver on their growth commitments we remain confident they can all be refranchised by next summer 2020 over time the net proceeds from such refranchising may help fund new companies seed markets enabling co development or adjacent franchise growth opportunities and other efficiencies in closing there are a lot of exciting things happening at del taco our digital value and innovation strategies will serve as important catalysts for sales growth and as always we plan to complement our top line initiatives with effective margin management and now steve will review our q4 financials and full year guidance for 2019 steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you john total fourth quarter revenue rose 7 3 to 157 3 million from 146 5 million in the year ago fourth quarter and included 4 1 million of franchise advertising contributions and 0 2 million of other franchise revenue related to the adoption of new revenue recognition rules in 2018 excluding these revenue recognition impacts total revenue grew by approximately 4 4 systemwide comparable restaurant sales increased 1 9 and lapped systemwide comparable restaurant sales of 2 4 during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a two year comp of 4 3 the del taco system is now generated 21 consecutive quarters of positive same store sales fourth quarter company restaurant sales increased 4 4 to 146 7 million from 140 6 million in the year ago period this increase was driven by contributions from additional company operated stores as compared to the fourth quarter of last year along with company operated comparable restaurant sales growth of 1 fourth quarter company operated comparable restaurant sales growth represents the 26th consecutive quarter of gains and was comprised of a 4 9 increase in check including over 1 in positive menu mix partially offset by a 3 9 decline in transactions franchise revenue increased 7 year over year to 5 3 million from 5 0 million last year the increase was driven by a franchise comparable restaurant sales growth of 3 2 other franchise revenue related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules and additional franchise operating stores as compared to the fourth quarter of last year turning to our expense item s food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales have decreased approximately 40 basis points year over year to 27 4 from 27 8 this was driven by many price increases partially offset by modest food inflation including increased distribution costs we also experienced slight margin pressure from our shredded beef and epic triple meat promotions which feature is slightly lower than typical margin percentage labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased approximately 40 basis points to 31 6 from 32 this was driven by lower payroll taxes due to the elimination of the federal unemployment payroll tax surcharge on california wages that was retroactively eliminated in november of 2018 for the entire 2018 tax year the favorable impact from this payroll tax elimination was 26 basis points for fiscal 2018 which was entirely realized during the fiscal fourth quarter we expect to retain this permanent lower rate prospectively occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased by approximately 30 basis points to 20 6 from 20 3 last year the 30 basis points of deleverage was due to inflationary pressure within this category that outpaced our modest same store sales gain of 1 based on its performance restaurant contribution was 29 8 million compared to 28 0 million in the prior year an increase of 6 5 restaurant contribution margin increased approximately 40 basis points to 20 3 from 19 9 general and administrative expenses were 13 4 million and as a percentage of total revenue increased by approximately 100 basis points year over year to 8 5 this increase was driven by increased legal and related expenses performance based management incentive compensation stock based compensation expense incremental sox 404 b compliance costs and the expense side of the other franchise revenue that is now reported on a gross basis as well as lower than expected revenues which magnified the percentage adjusted ebitda increase 1 2 to 23 6 million from 23 3 million last year as a percentage of total revenues adjusted ebitda decreased 90 basis points to 15 from 15 9 last year depreciation and amortization expense increased 9 6 to 8 2 million compared to 7 5 million last year with the increase driven by the addition of new assets as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization rose 10 basis points to 5 2 interest expense was 3 1 million compared to 2 4 million last year the increase was due to an increased one month libor rate and a higher average outstanding revolver balance compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as of the end of the fourth quarter we had 159 million outstanding under our revolver and our applicable margin for libor loans remained at 1 75 the income tax expense was 2 1 million during the fourth quarter for an effective tax rate of 27 1 as compared to a 24 8 million benefit during 2017 which included a one time income tax benefit as a result of the recent tax reform excluding this one time benefit the prior year rate would have been 41 6 and the lower effective tax rate is due to the impact of the recent tax reform net income for the fourth quarter was 5 6 million or 0 15 per diluted share compared to 35 2 million or 0 89 per diluted share last year in addition we are reporting adjusted net income which excludes impairment of long lived assets restaurant closure charges and other income related to insurance proceeds adjusted net income in the quarter was 7 0 million or 0 18 per diluted share compared to 6 2 million or 0 16 per diluted share last year turning now to our repurchase program covering common stock and warrants during the quarter we repurchased 765 209 shares of common stock at an average price of 11 05 per share and 20 596 warrants at an average price per warrant of a 1 93 for an aggregate of 8 5 million at fiscal year end approximately 29 6 million remained under the 75 million authorization i should add that during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 we have remain active when we repurchased approximately 200 000 shares in over 830 000 warrants so far this year one balance sheet point is the presentation of the held for sale captioned in current assets to reflect the carrying value of property and equipment sold in connection with the 13 unit refranchised transaction during the first quarter as well as own property for three new restaurants open in 2018 that we expect the sale leaseback in 2019 two such sale leaseback transactions were finalized in the first quarter the sale leaseback proceeds helped to net down our capital expenditures to align with our capital guidance that is provided on a net basis whereas our gaap presentation uses a gross basis before covering our fiscal year 2019 annual guidance i want to discuss the new lease accounting standard that is effective at the start of fiscal 2019 and how it is expected to impact our balance sheet and p l upon adoption all existing build to suit leases will become operating leases and we will be recognized all the existing doordash assets and deemed landlord financing liabilities going forward substantially all restaurants will be operating leases to be accounted for on the balance sheet we expect to recognize operating lease liabilities of approximately 220 million to 240 million and right of use assets of approximately 210 million to 230 million from a p l perspective there is no material change to our accounting for existing operating leases however the accounting for our prior build to suit leases will impact several key expense lines primarily occupancy and other operating expenses or build to suit leases will now be reported the expenses for these leases were previously reported in depreciation and interest expense this reclassification is expected to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 70 basis points on our restaurant contribution margin and adjusted ebitda and has been incorporated into our annual guidance it is important to note that this change is non cash expected to be net income neutral and does not reflect any underlying economic changes in performance in terms of guidance we are reiterating what we issued in january revised for the new lease accounting standard where appropriate and are furnishing several additional key metrics our top line expectations are unchanged including low single digit systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth with total revenue between 517 million and 527 million and company restaurants sales between 481 million and 491 million we continue to expect menu pricing of up to 4 to help mitigate the impact of food inflation of approximately 2 to 3 including higher distribution and transportation costs and labor inflation of approximately 6 primarily driven by 1 increase in california minimum wage general and administrative expenses between approximately 8 7 at 9 of total revenue this range reflects a plateau compared to 2018 in light of our first quarter refranchising activity which created an estimated 15 basis point increase as the g a savings from this transaction cannot be offset on a percentage basis given the reduction in restaurant sales with the aforementioned new lease accounting rules we revised our restaurant contribution margin expectations by 70 basis points to between 18 1 and 18 6 we also revised our adjusted ebitda estimate by the same of 70 basis points from the new lease accounting rules and we now expect between 66 5 million and 69 0 million the interest expense was now expected between 7 2 million and 7 6 million which represents the recent fourth quarter annualized run rate less approximately 2 6 million due to the new lease accounting rules which will now be recorded and operating in other expenses effective tax rate of approximately 26 5 to 27 5 diluted earnings per share of approximately 0 47 to 0 52 at least 25 systemwide new unit openings on a gross basis skewing toward franchise restaurants and an estimated 1 system wide closure rate and finally net capital expenditures of approximately 42 million to 47 million including approximately 18 million to 20 million for new unit construction approximately 14 million to 15 million to maintain or enhance existing restaurants and approximately 10 million to 12 million for discretionary investment including a remodel program test and technology investments such as mobile ordering and delivery drive through enhancements to improve throughput and learning management and workforce management upgrades to drive operational efficiencies with that we thank you for your interest in del taco and we are happy to answer any questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of alex slagle with jefferies please proceed with your question alex slagle jefferies analyst hey guys thanks for the question just wonder if you could provide additional perspective on the plan refranchising strategy and frame up what the range of outcomes might look like in terms of timing and potential impact on operating results in 2019 john d cappasola president and chief executive officer hey alex it s john let me start with the strategy here and now we re thinking about that and let steve kind of lend a bit on in your impact so clearly on a the franchising refranchising peers there s two components one which is really kind of falling under our portfolio optimization umbrella is what we did most recently that were the deals that were completed here in q1 2019 that was the 13 units that we refranchise to three local franchises in the la market that we feel really good about giving them the opportunity to turn these restaurants into a big win and they have a proven capability of doing that and some other acquisitions that they have done within our systems who are excited for them and excited about what they can do with these units and obviously we saw the opportunity too also acquire three franchise restaurants to company because these were in territories where the company operations was very strong so as i said you know as i said we don t have any plans to do anything further in that area but we re going to be very opportunistic in regards to portfolio optimization where it makes sense we re looking at other opportunities as we go down the road the other big component that we talked about obviously was the refranchising of non core western markets and a little bit different part of the strategy one that as we said has not been fully activated yet and there s no set timeline on that other than we d like to get all the markets done by the summer of 2020 so we re in process of evaluating right now and trying to make the best decisions there with the ultimate focus being let s partner with either existing or new franchisees that can deliver on growth and that s really kind of the thrust of that part of the strategy let me just throw it over to steve to see if it has any color on the impact of the 13 divestitures steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that has definitely been factored into our q1 guidance you know that is the purchase of 13 stores sales of three stores you know as we ve said a couple of months ago that we ll have an accretive impact to earnings has been fully reflected inside of our guidance however the non core markets in the west has not yet been factored into our guidance you know for now there s no specific update on timing other than to say you know there will be a process moving forward with a big focus on making sure we transact with the buyer or buyers most likely buyers who will most likely deliver on the growth commitments that will be part and parcel with those expected transactions alex slagle jefferies analyst got it and to what extent of you identified future new markets that you want to seed john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah we re in the process so we ve been evaluating several markets and we re not ready to announce anything just yet but i would say that we re getting we re getting close and realizing that you know what we re doing down in the southeast is actually a very viable strategy to move forward with in another territory or two so we ll make that decision here you know in the near future and we ll make sure that we you know we update everyone as appropriate alex slagle jefferies analyst and then just the last follow up if you had an estimate on the magnitude of the weather impact you saw in the first quarter and maybe any other views on the underlying momentum you see in business with the recent value efforts with the mixed two and recently the fresh faves boxes steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john touched on certainly adverse impacts q1 in the west very wet very cold as john said both company and system right now are slightly negative it s not a perfect calculation but had we experienced normalized weather we believe we would apply to slightly positive for company in system as well so maybe that percentage area of swing due to the weather alex slagle jefferies analyst thanks operator our next question comes from the line of craig bibb with cjs securities please proceed with your question craig bibb cjs securities analyst just maybe i ll just quickly follow up on that in terms like including the impact of weather quarter to date which is like a week left in the quarter you re running like a minus 5 almost in traffic is that do you have 4 prior to steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yes you re in the ballpark the traffic for the first quarter will be sequentially lower than the 3 9 ph that we experienced in the fourth quarter so in that 5 plus area is a good has to make although there is nine days left to go craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay and your kind of you re pushing 4 price which is aggressive and needed if you re confident that there s nothing push back there john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes i mean craig it s john so so far all of our internal analysis and the work that we ve done with our econometric modelling firm just continues to indicate that these pricing actions have been accretive and you know that said you can impact traffic to some degree when you take some level of pricing but the answer right now for us is i think overall it s been accretive for us and the focus now is let s really execute well our transaction momentum strategy which we believe as we assess the business coming out of elevated combined solutions mid last year we understood there were some it can be a conclusion there were some gaps that we needed to address on the digital front as well as some enhancements we can make to our value platform and then some exciting new news we needed to bring to the table and we had that and beyond meat that will be coming soon so i think all and we re ok with our pricing strategy we re going to continue to watch it and watch the market very closely and see what the competition is doing and measure it but we don t think that it s having a adverse impact a massively adverse impact to traffic at this point steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer and two other things we do there craig we consistently regularly measure or monitor our value and affordability perception ratings performed mpt grou we continue to be very strong both of those attributes so that s an important part of our thought process then also reading the competitive landscape it s certainly a level playing field in our view when it comes to wage and we definitely observe a lot of accelerated price happening out there in the marketplace you know most of our markets certainly in california by our peers as well craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay and lastly of the 400 00 app downloads sounds like a lot relative to your response to your store base do you know how it compares to your peers and do you have a goal for where you want to be and are they buying more or less than your average customer steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i d say you know our strategy going into this year was obviously use offers to build a database so that we could pivot coming out of 2019 to either a deeper loyalty program or really starts to leverage scale this platform so you know when we came into the year our focus was really around building the database and getting registered users up that was our number one goal and what we had put out there internally was that we wanted to you know we believed we could achieve somewhere in the high six figure range i d love to see us achieve somewhere just right over seven figures if we can and that s certainly what the team s doing of course we re ramping up quickly we re at about 700 registered users per store right now and as you know as you move through time it probably will become a little bit more difficult to register folks but i could see us in the high in a high six figure range maybe low seven figure range this year and what s important with that is you know obviously we are giving these folks reasons to come back to del toco on a weekly basis where we re looking at their activity we re sending them targeted offers and over time as that database becomes bigger it ll be easier for us to be more certain in regards to how we can move the needle on the same store sales side of the business so over time it s a crm platform but right now it s about building that database craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay thanks a lot john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah thanks operator our next question comes from the line of jeremy hamblin with dougherty co please proceed with your question jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst hi thanks i want to start by coming back to the labor comments and the payroll taxes for q4 i think you if i caught this right 26 basis points for fiscal 18 in total does that imply that it was roughly 100 basis points for the year i m sorry 100 basis point impact for q4 what was the the impact steve for q4 on that particular item the benefit steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer the 26 basis points for the year it could drive just over 1 2 million which would be about 83 basis points for the fiscal fourth quarter so looking at that line item the leverage of 40 basis points you know absent that positive news from california file would have been deleverage of 40 to 50 basis points in the full year would have deleveraged probably 40 basis points rather than the 10 basis points that we reported so a bit of a one time good guy in some respects but very positively it is a permanent relief if you will that rate has permanently gone away so it is a benefit that we will carry forward into future years jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst understood and as i think about your guidance for 6 wage inflation this year and how that compared to 2018 one of the factors as we think about that labor line item that s been a hurdle for a while how we should be thinking about that this year do you expect maybe slightly higher impact to that line item in total in 2019 steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer we think the 6 estimate is solid so we have 1 of wage increase this year last year there was 0 50 so last year the original guide was 4 to 5 and we landed that inflation rate somewhere in that mid 4 area so we do feel good about the 6 this year every extra dollar becomes a little bit less proportionately and unfortunately things that are more fixed in nature the agm salaries health insurance as well as workers compensation have all trended in a much less inflationary manner so it allows us to kind of net that all down to more of that msd type rate that right now we see at 6 for 2019 jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst got it thanks and then wanted to ask a question on g a moving forward so after we get through the refranchising effort and you see some normalization you continue to see your g a line item grow as a percent of sales over the last several years you mentioned it plateauing this year how can we be thinking about that now as you go from 55 to 45 company owned locations as we look forward is that something where g a it s popping out and potentially could even be lower on an absolute basis with 10 fewer location steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer sure good question yeah near term for 2019 as i mentioned kind of pro forma for that first quarter refranchising activity you know that itself causes about 15 bps of pressure so the 2018 prior ph would have otherwise been reported around 8 8 so the guide for the year ahead of 8 7 to 9 more or less colors at outcome so we are in essence flat telling this year and the midpoint reflects about 5 5 dollar inflation year on year which is more reflective of the very lower unemployment inflationary environment that we re in so that s what we re expecting for the year ahead as far as getting into our refranchising of the non core markets that you know will happen over time as those happen we ll be very careful to give you a very good update and guidance on what will happen you know restaurant level royalties as well as the g a impact so without a doubt as you refranchise larger numbers of restaurants there certainly is you know i ll call it variable g a you know the above store leader who usually runs 8 to 12 stores is a great example you know those cuts will be made and essentially transfer to the franchisees when they happened but naturally ph there is a large drop in restaurant sales as well as revenues so you know over time if this happened we ll try to bring more color into what the percent of revenue will do it may actually take up somewhat but you know as we are maybe more important is what is the dollar inflation year over year in light of what we need to manage the business naturally we need to saw lot of restaurants a lot of those needs do go down so we ll be very focused on you know taking those variable g a cost of our p l as those restaurant refranchise transactions happen and giving good color on what that then translates to on a percent of revenue basis as we move forward jeremy hamblin dougherty co analyst thanks for taking the questions good luck john d cappasola president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of peter saleh with btig please proceed with your question peter saleh btig analyst great thank you and thanks for taking the question guys i want to ask about the refranchising and how franchisees are thinking about their capital i guess not just this year but going forward as the franchisees absorb some of these company units over the course of the next year 18 months do we think about you know that any sort of acceleration in new unit development as a system to get pushed out to 2021 and beyond you know maybe as franchisees are absorbing some of these units is this going to limit the amount of capital they have to put into new unit gross openings going forward steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer you see peter i wouldn t say that would be the case i mean how we re thinking about this is it s a combination of new and existing franchisees is instead we re definitely looking to bring some new blood into the system that can leverage a base of company operations to get really competent on the brand very quickly and then pivot obviously into growth and that s going to be the real catalysts of selling these markets so whether it s a new franchisee or an existing franchisee their ability to move and deliver on a growth agreement that s material for us so the idea there is to spur new unit growth specifically franchise growth peter saleh btig analyst so are all the refranchise units or all the deals together planning to put together over the course of the next year or so they come with required sort of new unit build going forward in those markets with the franchisees john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes absolutely growth will be a big part of the sale process and that ll be really one of the driving pieces for us in regards to divesting these units but it won t necessarily be just in the markets growth in the markets that they currently reside in there may also be adjacent growth or new territories attached to that so again these are folks that are likely going to be sophisticated franchisees some of them may have multi state operations some of them may not but either way we would expect to be able to attach some level of agreement to it that would be either within the existing market or outside of the market tbd ph dependent on the groups and the attractiveness of the groups that we take a lot of look at here over the next couple of quarters peter saleh btig analyst great and then just my last question is i think you guys mentioned the addition of couple more third party aggregators doordash and postmates later this year can i just talk about that decision why you decided to move forward with more partners and what exactly is entailed to add these partners is it more tech investment are they making the tech investment what needs to be done to further integrate these other delivery partners steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i mean what we talked about in the past is really our strategy on delivery is we believe a multi year delivery service provider approach is the best way for us to kind of break through and optimize consumer demand once we got our heads around the economic model associated with delivery which for us we ve talked about the kind of the big pillars for us were check average is what we re seeing so far with our launch is nearly 2x so the store level checkout inaudible there s a lot of as far as us a lot of as far as room to play with on the margin dollars side and also we wanted to be able to do premium pricing and we are doing now we tested that and we found that at a reasonable level it was the consumer was willing to pay it because of that convenience additional convenience suit been able to get del taco delivered to your doorstep so we ve activated that so that s helped us so the economic model we feel really good about so now it s about let s get as much demand as we can and what we saw on our test is that as we layered on the multi delivery service providers we actually saw step ups in the in some units in the actual delivery rate that we were seeing at these restaurants so we like that approach we think every trader is a little bit different every market is a little bit different and the breadth of having the three dsps and that s grubhub postmates and doordash activated together is important to us the other component i would only mention is you know we absolutely want to have pos integration we found through our test that you know the tablet approach in having tablets laying around the restaurant wasn t very conducive to an efficient and seamless transaction for our operators and it was actually hurting overall satisfaction from a perspective of order accuracy so if pos integration is done for us is actually we ve seen overall satisfaction scores in some cases surpass what we see through or drive through in dining experience so we ve removed that order accuracy issue because you know with the stand alone tablet that employee is actually having the key and the order manually to the pos and we don t want that to have to happen so pos integration is really important and we re leveraging existing technology that we have in our restaurants today along with some new technology features that come along with platforms like we although brings to the table to make sure that we have integration peter saleh btig analyst great thank you very much very helpful john d cappasola president and chief executive officer you got it operator our next question comes from the line of joshua long with piper jaffray please proceed with your question joshua long piper jaffray analyst great thank you for taking my question i wanted to circle back to some of the comments you mentioned about moving into more states year over year and just curious on how you re thinking about driving brand awareness or maybe leveraging some of the new platforms and tools that you have this year versus 2018 to make sure you re really getting the most leverage out of everything in driving awareness of the brand john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah great question josh our playbook that we ve developed over the last several years which has really helped us to perform across our diverse geographic footprint within our franchise base certainly it is a very local market driven approach to trying to own the four walls and inaudible we so we call it being best on block and it starts with combined solutions obviously that s our overarching strategy that is to make sure that we are absolutely focused on guest metrics operating metrics and people metrics at the restaurant level to drive our performance so when the marketing comes in we re going to able to deliver on that promise so having really solid operations underneath us being best on block is an absolute driver of our performance the other piece is obviously getting ourselves into good real estate so you know we want to make sure especially as we getting into a market that may be considered more an emerging market or a state where we don t quite have the level of brand awareness picking the right sites and getting into the right straight areas are critical and you know that kind of two things working together we ve talked about this over time we really see success like what we ve seen over the years in a market like michigan and what we re starting to see down in the southeast is pick the right real estate with the right operating model and mindset and you can win and then obviously we do a lot on the local marketing side we don t have national advertising to fall back on so typical to kind of who we are as a brand we re very scrappy and as the combined solutions is all about so we do a lot of local marketing digital advertising we try to get involved in the trade area and the communities around the trade area and we want franchisees that have that belief and willingness to do that as well so that s been some of the key things that we ve seen that we set ourselves up for that have helped the brand in some of these newer markets over the last few years joshua long piper jaffray analyst very helpful color i appreciate that when thinking about some of your commentary about how trends improved sequentially you mentioned the comparison and obviously we can see that as well just curious of that was more of a back half of your comment knowing that comparisons do materially ease the 3q 4q period if you felt confident enough in the initiatives and some of the new mini platforms you have for them to start being more of a contributor here into 2q in the first half the year as well john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes i mean i think the way to think about it is as these big transitory headwinds start to subside weather and lent offset which we ve been very transparent about and talked about on this call today i think we re poised for same store sales improvements in q2 and i think you should expect some further acceleration as the year goes on and we implement both the transaction momentum strategy but also this compare start to ease specifically in q3 and q4 so i think when you look at the transaction momentum strategy we ve gotten the second phase out the door now in the last couple of weeks with fresh faves boxes beyond meat is about to come toward the back end of the april so right within q2 and we feel really good about those platforms being on transaction momentum drivers for the brand joshua long piper jaffray analyst okay that s exactly what i was looking for i appreciate that context and then last one for me in terms of some of the discretionary spending you highlighted in the capex bucket curious if there s anything you could talk about in terms of the remodel test that you outlined or maybe some of the other upgrades around operations and operational efficiency i m sure it s still early and you re testing a lot of things that try to really be getting the specific details but just curious can you give us a sense of where some of those dollars or what some of the projects you re thinking about could be down the road john d cappasola president and chief executive officer sure good question josh so certainly we did touch on our plans to have a remodeled test program during 2019 we always looking to make sure we understand what the right design and look feel of that next generation remodel looks like during this year go there being to optimize that program look at the return profile and then beyond 2019 we ll be in a position to talk about more of the likely acceleration of that on a longer term basis other exciting things kind of discretionary uses of capital certainly technology investments ranging from you know investment to further operationalize and roll out things like mobile ordering as well as expanding delivery some drive through technology enhancements to help improve throughput at the drive through and other investments in both learning management and workforce management systems that help drive operational efficiencies long term so a number of items going on there that we re pretty optimistic about steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer one other thing i wanted to just add because i think it s a good point and color and context in regards to you know setting ourselves up for success within the four walls with combined solutions is we ve got nearly 450 restaurants today that have rolled out the new two tier warning devices which we re excited about some of you guys may have seen those in our restaurants we ve talked about them a bit so that innovation is going to provide a real quality and consistency within our operations we have 250 million products sold annually in the two tire del taco and we want them to be hot so this device really improves throughput for us because it s been a bottleneck for us in the past while also improving quality for our guests so that s another piece that we re excited about and our operators and franchisees are really getting on board with an excited about as well joshua long piper jaffray analyst great thank you for taking my question today john d cappasola president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of nick setyan with wedbush securities please proceed with your question nick setyan wedbush securities analyst thank you my question is on the third party delivery i mean so far have you guys been happy relatively through your expectations around the economics are you seeing that attach rates turn into the higher margin items like sodas kind of in line with your original expectations you know aside from obviously the top line impact you know what the margin impact any just kind of any color around the early learnings would be helpful is there any kind of way to think about you know to what extent it s benefiting makes but it s impacting transactions as a shifting individual people into maybe bigger groups john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah nick these are all great questions i can answer every single one of them right now sitting here today as we re in the middle and we just kind of finished up our full roll out here with grubhub and we re learning each and every day so far what i d say about the volume is you know as we kind of expected was on an overall average it s relatively low right now but you know we are seeing some locations that are significantly outperforming and we think that as we move forward we believe the performance is going to continue to get better and there is going to be further demand driven you know a couple of things are gonna help out one is really in just this quarter we just started the marketing around it and each promotion you re going to see more marketing related to grubhub delivery in the markets that we are offering in and as doordash and postmates come on you ll see marketing around that s so driving brand awareness is going to be a key piece for us as we move forward and then obviously the other piece that s going to help create some more demand on the delivery front is going to be adding the additional few providers so right now it is a single provider that we re using really with grubhub outside there are some tests that we re doing with doordash and once doordash comes on and postmates come on on full system now you ve got the full suite if you will really helping us to drive demand and we would expect performance to improve so i would say as we move forward on the transactional front or the demand front that should get better and get stronger as we move through times as we move through time for the reasons that we outlined and just in regard to the overall mix check listen you know the check average like i said is about to 2x right now that what we re experiencing in our restaurants compared to what we re seeing on the delivery front we kind of anticipated that would happen so it s nice to see that what we saw on test markets is fairly similar and we feel good about that and we feel good that we re not getting a lot of pushback on the incremental pricing that we ve put out thus far like i said the overall satisfaction associated with delivery transactions actually rivals to that of our drive through and our dining room right now so steve any color you want to add on on the margin front steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the 2x check helps create some margin efficiencies if you will things like the credit card fee wipes are on the dsp not us and the premium pricing that s not the whole commission but you know a very good chunk of it those all can go a long way to neutralize any potential adverse margin percentage impact so we feel good about that so at this point about scaling the first two and three in the later this year we ll have a better for overall velocity and what how it kind of ramps up as it becomes more material as the year progresses nick setyan wedbush securities analyst got it and a similar question on the app we ve gotten a lot of reports from others that maybe it s not necessary driving our transactions and it is putting pressure on mix what s been the early experience so far with the app john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yes i mean like i said we re 400 000 registered users almost 700 registered users per restaurant the way you think about probably margin management on this nick is in the long term as crm kicks in we believe this can become very creative obviously in the long term you re thinking about you can start to target to an individual user to spur behavior that you wouldn t have otherwise received right so it becomes incremental on transactions that you re driving right now we re in build the database load and let s do that through offers so that we can get to the point that we can use crm so in the short term as we think about 2019 well what we re really doing is we re managing the discount rate across the business right so we have other discounts that are happening in our business whether it be email marketing or print marketing that we do out and some of our markets for coupons are offered local store marketing efforts that field marketing uses so whether we ve asked marketing to do is really rationalize some of that existing discount that is in our margin line already or baked in to pivot that over to or transition that over to the mobile app as we know that we re going to have to invest a bit to get this thing up and running right so what you saw in our guidance that steve provided was that we modeled that fully out within our guidance range and that kind of horse trading that s occurring between you know the different marketing avenues right now and obviously we played our cards right we re able to manage the margin in the short run while we build the database which provides a bigger opportunity down the road operator our next question comes from the line of steven anderson with maxim group please proceed with your question steven anderson maxim group analyst yes good afternoon just want to ask about some of the menu news you have forthcoming address value most recently mostly in the middle of the menu bar bell last year you did the lower end of that barbell so actually if you having is coming toward the higher end i know you had the plateaus come out coming up against the two and three year anniversary of that and just want to see if you have any news forthcoming on that later this year john d cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah so i said beyond meat is definitely in what we re thinking about beyond taco that s definitely more in that kind of inaudible premium range of our menu strategy steven so we feel really excited about what the opportunity is with beyond and you know obviously one of the things we wanted to do here was tap into that better for unique state to really help to further differentiate del taco as a qsr plus brand but we also believe it s going to drive incremental sales by attracting a user that maybe a new user or a lapsed user and we ve seen through our tests that it s also applicable to existing users so the consumer opportunity is immense and it s exciting and we think that activating that platform more in that mid tier and premium range is absolutely appropriate it will literally be when you think about the accessibility to a product like this the del taco is going to create there is no one else doing it in our category at the price point that we re about to offer so that s where our ability to do that and create accessibility at a lower price point than what you re seeing from others in mexican qsr particularly but across the category is we re pretty excited about steven anderson maxim group analyst that s reiterated you ve have seen for beyond meat you re seeing increase traffic as well as ticket john d cappasola president and chief executive officer traffic and check gross yes steven anderson maxim group analyst yes thank you john d cappasola president and chief executive officer thank you operator we have reached all the time we have for questions and i would like to turn the call back to john cappasola for closing remarks john d cappasola president and chief executive officer all right everyone well thank you for joining us today and spending time with us on the brand we appreciate your interest in del taco and we look

a barrel for the first time since november smaller company stocks fared better than the rest of the market financial consumer goods and technology stocks accounted for much of the gains goldman sachs

war between the u s and china after several weeks of negotiations it s not clear how close the two sides are to an agreement a meeting between president donald trump and chinese leader xi jinping to formalize a deal might be pushed back to june according to some news reports traders were also looking ahead to the federal reserve s next interest rate policy update on wednesday in many ways the market is in limbo said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra and in the meantime investors are waiting for some sort of agreement on the trade talks as well as the fed the s p 500 gained 10 46 points or 0 4 percent to 2 832 94 the benchmark index is now up 13 percent for 2019 so far which is a bigger gain than it s had in four of the last five full years the dow jones industrial average

to 1 563 93 major stock indexes in europe finished mostly higher u s stocks have had a strong showing this year with all the major indexes showing a gain of at least 11 percent one key to the recent rally has been the belief that the federal reserve will slow its pace of increases for interest rates the worry in december was that the central bank would raise rates too fast in the face of a slowing global economy and choke off growth the fed will meet to discuss interest rate policy this week with an announcement scheduled for wednesday but economists expect it to announce no change to rates the expectations are that the fed won t do anything in the first half of the year stovall said some economists say the fed could release documents wednesday that would suggest one rate increase in 2019 or possibly zero after the fed raised rates four times in 2018 and three times in 2017 perhaps more important is what the fed says about its vast trove of bonds the central bank bought trillions of dollars of bonds after the 2008 financial crisis to keep interest rates low and support markets but it s been slowly letting some roll off as they mature investors want to know how much the fed will ultimately hold onto and how long it will take to get there monday s upward swing in oil prices came after opec canceled a meeting that had been scheduled for next month the move means

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all but we only have an hour laughs kissane thank you faskianos you can follow carolyn on twitter at carolynkissane and we will be announcing the fall academic webinar lineup in the cfr academic bulletin if you ve not already subscribed you can email us to subscribe send us an email again i encourage you to share with your students our cfr paid internships announcement we also have fellowships for professors you and they can go to cfr org careers follow us at cfr_academic and visit cfr org foreignaffairs com and thinkglobalhealth org for research and analysis on global issues thank you all again good luck with your finals carolyn kissane thank you so much kissane thank you it was a pleasure great faskianos and we look forward to your continued participation in this series kissane thank you very much appreciate everyone s questions bye end
oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all but we only have an hour laughs kissane thank you faskianos you can follow carolyn on twitter at carolynkissane and we will be announcing the fall academic webinar lineup in the cfr academic bulletin

closing the gender gap the economic benefits of bringing more women into the labour force era dabla norris is a division chief in the imf s fiscal affairs department and kalpana kochhar is director of the imf s human resources department washington dc mar 19 2019 ips as girls we were raised with the belief that we could accomplish anything and that no barrier was insurmountable yet for so many women the reality doesn t quite meet their aspirations things weren t exactly equal in the relatively conservative middle class society in india where we both grew up but we thought of gender inequality as largely an issue of social justice it was only after we started delving into the topic that we came to realize that it is an equally significant economic issue women make up almost half of the world s working age population of nearly 5 billion people but only about 50 percent of those women participate in the labor force compared with 80 percent of men not only is female labor force participation lower but women who are paid for their work are disproportionately employed in the informal sector especially in developing economies where employers are subject to fewer regulations leaving workers more vulnerable to lower wages and job losses furthermore even in the formal sector women doing the same work and having the same level of education earn less than their male counterparts and because women generally spend less time in the paid labor market they have lower pensions and face a higher risk of poverty in old age among those who do work few rise to senior positions or start their own businesses women also shoulder a higher share of unpaid work within the family including childcare and domestic tasks which can limit their opportunity to engage in paid work and constrain their options when they do the imf s research highlights how the uneven playing field between women and men imposes large costs on the global economy early imf studies on the economic impact of gender gaps assumed that men and women were likely to be born with the same potential but that disparities in access to education health care and finance and technology legal rights and social and cultural factors prevented women from realizing that potential in turn these barriers facing women shrank the pool of talent available to employers kochhar jain chandra and newiak 2017 the result was lower productivity and lower economic growth the losses to an economy from economic disempowerment of women were estimated to range from 10 percent of gdp in advanced economies to more than 30 percent in south asia and in the middle east and north africa more recent research suggests that the economic benefits of bringing more women into the labor force exceed previous estimates this is because women and men may have the same potential but they bring different skills and ideas that are economically valuable to the table ostry and others 2018 gender differences may reflect social norms and their impact on upbringing social interactions risk preferences and response to incentives for instance studies have found women to be more risk averse reflecting greater fear of failure and less competitive women s greater caution has benefits gender balanced corporate boards improve firm performance especially in high tech manufacturing and knowledge intensive services gender diversity on boards of banking supervision agencies is also associated with greater financial stability sahay and čihák 2018 similarly banks with higher shares of women board members have thicker capital buffers a lower proportion of nonperforming loans and greater resistance to stress possibly because having more women in executive positions contributes to diversity and complementarity of thought leading to better decision making drawing on macroeconomic sectoral and firm level data a recent imf study ostry and others 2018 suggests that men and women complement each other in the workplace in terms of different skills and perspectives including different attitudes toward risk and collaboration as a result increasing women s employment boosts growth and incomes more than previously estimated exceeding the improvement that comes simply from adding workers among countries where gaps in participation rates are the largest closing them adds 35 percent to gdp on average four fifths of the gains come from adding workers to the labor force but fully one fifth arises from the boost to productivity brought by greater gender diversity the study also shows that increasing women s labor force participation produces large gains in economic welfare which account for changes in consumption goods home production and leisure time these gains exceed 20 percent in south asia and the middle east and north africa see chart 1 another important finding when more women participate in the labor force men also benefit why because women s complementary skills raise productivity boosting wages for everyone this increase in productivity more than makes up for the decline in wages that might be expected when more workers are competing for jobs but simply bringing more women into the workforce may not be enough a recent imf study sounds a cautionary note on the challenges women face in a rapidly changing labor market brussevich and others 2018 digitalization artificial intelligence and machine learning are hollowing out jobs that involve routine and repetitive tasks while increasing the value of jobs involving management and cognitive skills hard won gains from policies to increase the number of women in the paid workforce and close wage gaps may be quickly eroded if women are overrepresented in jobs at high risk of automation indeed the study finds that women perform more routine tasks than men across all sectors and occupations although there is significant variation across countries the risk of displacement is particularly high for less educated women those aged 40 and above and those in low skill clerical and sales jobs meanwhile women across sectors and occupations are underrepresented in professional and managerial positions that are at lower risk of displacement by technology globally women hold fewer than 20 percent of board seats in banks and bank supervision agencies sahay and čihák 2018 and account for fewer than 2 percent of bank ceos in the fast growing tech sector women are 15 percent less likely than men to be managers and professionals and 19 percent more likely to be clerks and service workers see chart 2 given the current state of technology the study estimates that 26 million women s jobs in 30 countries 28 countries in the organisation for economic co operation and development plus cyprus and singapore have a greater than 70 percent chance of being displaced by technology within two decades on a global scale this suggests that 180 million women s jobs are at risk while more men than women are at risk of being displaced by automation the number of female jobs lost represents a larger proportion of the female labor force what can be done because gender inequality is so multifaceted there is no single remedy and the best policy approach will vary across countries depending on the level of economic development existing gender gaps and the speed at which the new technology affects the economy three broad areas can be highlighted first policies to bring more women into the workforce a range of institutional legal regulatory and fiscal policy levers have been shown to boost female labor force participation while there is no one size fits all solution policies should seek to foster opportunity and remove barriers policies and infrastructure that make it easier for women to reconcile work and family life are particularly effective emerging market and developing economies should invest in infrastructure in rural south africa for example electrification increased female labor force participation by 9 percent in india building adequate sanitation facilities narrowed gender gaps in education and in female labor force participation mexico introduced public buses exclusively for women to ensure that they could travel safely support female entrepreneurs by increasing their access to finance women often face more restrictive collateral requirements shorter maturity of loans and higher interest rates than men see banking on the future of women in this issue of f d initiatives such as malaysia s women entrepreneur financing programme and chile s simplified deposit accounts have helped close the gender gap in borrowing rates promote equal rights for women measures include addressing laws governing inheritance and property rights malawi namibia and peru revised their legal frameworks to reduce gender discrimination in the decade that followed female labor force participation rates increased substantially in all three countries advanced economies should push for greater parity between maternity and paternity leave in sweden this has helped mothers return to work more rapidly and has shifted underlying gender norms about parenting promote access to affordable high quality childcare an example is japan which expanded childcare leave benefits from 50 percent to 67 percent of salary research shows that cutting the cost of childcare by half could increase the number of young mothers in the labor market by 10 percent there is also considerable evidence that women are more responsive to specific tax policies than men these include policies that do not penalize the secondary earner who is still most likely to be female by replacing family taxation with individual taxation as canada italy and sweden have done tax relief measures for low income families have also been found to increase employment rates for women the reason tax relief reduces the tax burden and increases after tax earnings for women thus increasing the incentive for women to join or remain in the labor force examples include the earned income tax credit in the united states and a combination of tax credits and transfers in belgium germany and the united kingdom second policies to provide women with the right skills and to empower women in the workplace gender parity in investments in education and health are necessary to ensure that women can obtain quality jobs in india for instance imf research suggests that female labor force participation would rise by 2 percentage points if indian states increased education spending by 1 percent of gdp building skills early would also provide the most important safeguard against displacement by technology and allow women to benefit from new work opportunities for those already in the workforce fiscal instruments such as tax deductions for training in the netherlands and portable individual learning accounts in france can remove barriers to lifelong learning countries could also consider subsidizing training by private companies via dedicated payroll taxes and public grants concerted efforts are needed to provide women with more opportunities to rise into managerial and leadership roles by setting relevant recruitment and retention targets for organizations setting promotion quotas as was done in norway and creating mentorship and training programs large gender gaps persist in access to the digital technology that creates new job opportunities 60 percent of the global population mostly women in emerging market and developing economies still have no access to the internet 250 million fewer women are online than men public and private investment will be essential to support technological adoption and close digital gender gaps finland s approach to ensuring universal access to broadband connectivity digital education for all and digital access to business and government services is a good example of a comprehensive approach to closing the gender digital divide third easing transitions for displaced workers given that female workers face a particularly high risk of being displaced through automation it will be essential to ensure equal support for displaced men and women through labor market policies to improve skills connect workers with jobs and promote job creation social protection systems will also need to adapt to more flexible forms of work such as telework to address deteriorating income security associated with rapid technological change some advanced economies may consider expanding noncontributory pensions and adopting basic income guarantees recent decades have seen considerable progress in leveling the playing field for economic opportunities but much more work remains to be done the good news is that countries across the globe have embraced the imperative for gender equality policymakers governments and corporations now recognize the benefits for economic growth and development of giving women equal opportunities and they are seeking to improve their policies and practices in this area the imf is committed to working with other international organizations governments civil society organizations and the private sector to reduce barriers to gender equality by providing policy advice and analysis
president donald trump s budget is dead on arrival and my conservatism notwithstanding that is a good thing u s economy is beset by negative structural forces beyond our borders growth is slowing a recession is becoming a real risk and the totality of the president s budget cuts is ill advised instead he should articulate an agenda that challenges the congress to keep the recovery on track china s flagging economy won t be resurrected by any trade deal hatched by presidents trump and xi the communist leader has imposed more state controls that breed corruption and waste and burden provincial governments and private businesses with a mountain of debt repeated injections of credit and fiscal stimulus won t solve that mess europe remains obsessed with preserving dysfunctional macroeconomic policies required to sustain a euro that promotes german exports but is overvalued for less dynamic southern european economies italy is slipping into recession and growth elsewhere remains perilously close to zero brussels obsession with punishing britain for brexit and theresa may s unimaginative leadership leaves the island nation struggling more european central bank stimulus is like an opioid for a cancer patient it relieves pain but will not reverse the inevitable the ultimate collapse of the eu as a global force no surprise u s imports are growing more rapidly than exports and the trade deficit jumped 10 last year that taxes u s growth and armistices pausing trump s trade wars won t significantly alter the reality that revving up u s growth requires boosting domestic demand and addressing skilled labor shortages democratic senators running for president see all this and are promoting socialist solutions each has embraced the green new deal which requires de facto government takeovers of the automotive banking health care education and energy sectors and a maoist iron rice bowl a guaranteed basic income for all americans are not that radical democrats won the house with moderate candidates promising to work for practical solutions to improve health care and transportation and to reform immigration the latter touches a cultural nerve in ways washington s aging political class and northeast liberals simply don t grasp u s prescription drugs are rising at nearly double the rate of inflation even after all the discounts to pharmacy benefit managers that the drug companies like to blame the white house should challenge congress with pre drafted bills for example one that explicitly links u s drug prices to those charged in germany similarly the administration should offer a bill ending big pharma s penchant for suing generic manufactures and forcing agreements that delay generics and limit competition and perhaps investigate a few ceos for outright price fixing trump s 1 5 trillion dollar infrastructure plan got little traction because it is full of questionable right wing ideas for example private toll roads too often fail and it didn t specify how the 200 billion federal contribution would be funded after 25 years at 18 4 cents per gallon it s time to raise the gas tax 25 cents and offer the proceeds to the states on a per capita basis to do as they please if they match with new money and spend what they receive within 12 months each dollar of tax collected if spent immediately would boost gross domestic product by the same amount and create good paying middle class jobs trump should de emphasize the border wall he doesn t have the votes in congress and the courts will decide if his national emergency is legitimate instead offer a grand deal on legal immigration permanent status for dacas if the democrats will agree to reform family reunification rules and replace the visa lottery with a system that emphasizes badly needed stem skills trump needs to move to the center on those issues with simple understandable proposals in ready drafted bills then challenge leaders nancy pelosi and mitch mcconnell to put those to up or down votes and hammer them relentlessly when they delay these are hard swallows for many in congress but all would help lift wages right away and make trump the pragmatist in the face of a do nothing congress that only bickers investigates and complains all should be pitched as initiatives to improve the conditions for working americans the folks who will ultimately determine the occupant of the oval office in 2021 peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist he tweets pmorici1

voting shares and class b multiple voting shares outstanding were 10 968 227 and 10 969 180 in 2018 and 2017 respectively impacting the year over year comparative results were certain non recurring factors in 2017 and 2018 when excluded net income for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 12 682 or 1 16 per class a subordinate voting share and class b multiple voting share outstanding in 2018 compared to 10 354 or 0 94 per class a subordinate voting share and class b multiple voting share outstanding for the year ended december 31 2017 these items were an asset impairment charge of 6 285 on the farmersburg indiana clay brick plant was recorded in 2017 an impairment reversal of 2 143 and a provision for income taxes of 268 on the loan receivable from universal resource recovery inc universal was recognized in 2017 and a net gain of 762 was recognized in april 2018 on the acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in the universal joint venture discussion of operations year ended december 31 2018 revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 159 885 from 156 244 for the corresponding period in 2017 higher shipments in the first half of 2018 were supported by mild weather conditions the carry forward of the backlog in residential construction from 2017 and an increase in multi family housing construction in ontario canada in addition 2018 first quarter landscape revenues were higher under the 2017 2018 dealer winter booking program due to a deferral of the 2017 fourth quarter shipments to 2018 because of production capacity constraints in 2017 however during the second half of 2018 the momentum in residential construction eased off from the high levels experienced in the prior year due in part to fiscal measures introduced in ontario to moderate the recent rapid appreciation in house prices in the province this decrease was partially offset by an increase in landscape product shipments under the company s 2018 2019 dealer winter booking program during the fourth quarter of 2018 cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 120 289 from 118 307 for the corresponding period in 2017 due to higher shipments and higher freight costs for product transfers to facilitate customer deliveries this increase was offset in part by lower natural gas costs efficiencies in electric power consumption and a reduction in certain plant related expenditures from 2017 levels selling expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 13 390 from 12 625 in 2017 this increase was due to marketing costs for product promotional displays in the company s expanding eastern canadian markets as well as marketing costs to improve the customer experience on the company s social media platforms and higher cloud based application costs for improved customer online interactivity general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 decreased to 7 964 from 9 003 for the prior year this decrease was mainly due to the 2017 cash settlement of certain employee stock options which amounted to an expense of 771 compared to a credit of 13 to share based compensation cost recognized in 2018 upon settlement of these employee stock options the increase decrease in the settlement date fair market value fmv from the grant date fmv is recognized as an expense income in share based compensation cost in addition compensation cost recognized on share appreciation rights amounted to 112 2017 452 for the year ended december 31 2018 compensation costs on share appreciation rights are measured at fair value at each reporting period and are impacted by estimated changes in the company s exchange traded share price on april 2 2018 the acquisition of the remaining 50 interest in universal was accounted for as an effective sale of the existing 50 interest in the joint venture and the acquisition of a 100 interest in universal at fair value on the acquisition date based on the fair valuation of the underlying property in universal which was estimated to be 13 000 the company recognized a net gain of 762 this gain effectively represented the company s partial recovery of the previously recorded impairment charges on its investment in the joint venture as at december 31 2017 the estimated fair value of the secured non interest bearing non current loan receivable from universal was estimated at 6 393 this amount exceeded its carrying value of 4 250 accordingly an impairment reversal of 2 143 and a provision for income taxes of 268 was recognized as at december 31 2017 to write up the loan receivable to its fair value for the year 2018 the asset impairment evaluation on the property plant and equipment of the farmersburg indiana clay brick plant cash generating unit cgu did not result in any impairment charge an impairment charge of 6 285 was recorded for the prior year the asset impairment tests resulted from an assessment of the company s u s residential and commercial markets which indicated continuing uncertain economic conditions in 2018 management s assessment of the external and internal indicators of impairment as per ias 36 impairment of assets ias 36 determined that there was no indication that the brampton clay brick plant the canadian concrete plants and the michigan concrete plant may be impaired other income of 294 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to an expense of 120 for the prior year was primarily due to the translation of foreign currency transactions as a result of currency exchange fluctuations between the canadian and u s dollar during the year operating income increased to 19 347 for the year ended december 31 2018 from operating income of 12 004 in 2017 excluding the non recurring transactions described above operating income for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 18 585 from 16 146 for the prior year finance expense for the year ended december 31 2018 was 1 114 compared to a finance expense of 666 in 2017 excluding the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap of 31 2017 unrealized gain of 596 finance expense for the current year decreased to 1 083 compared to 1 262 for the corresponding prior year the decrease in finance expense was due to a decrease in debt balances outstanding as a result of scheduled repayments totaling 1 950 in each of 2018 and 2017 the provision for income taxes amounted to 4 789 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to a provision of 5 394 for the 2017 fiscal year no deferred tax assets were recorded with respect to the potential deferred tax benefit pertaining to non capital losses carried forward by the company s u s operations three months ended december 31 2018 for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2018 the company recorded net income of 991 or 0 09 per class a subordinate voting share and class b multiple voting share compared to a net loss of 3 066 or 0 28 per class a subordinate voting share and class b multiple voting share for the fourth quarter of 2017 the aggregate weighted average number of class a subordinate voting shares and class b multiple voting shares outstanding was 10 960 130 and 10 973 754 for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge of 6 285 and the impairment reversal on the universal loan receivable of 1 875 net of taxes as discussed above the company s net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1 344 or 0 12 per class a subordinate voting share and class b multiple voting share for the fourth quarter of 2018 revenues were 34 244 compared to 36 567 for the same period in 2017 the decrease in shipments in the masonry products business segment was partially offset by an increase in the landscape products business segment compared to the corresponding prior period costs of sales and freight costs also decreased primarily due to lower shipments although lower production volumes increased per unit costs lower natural gas costs recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset these increases as a result operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2 136 compared to an operating loss of 1 920 for the corresponding quarter in 2017 excluding the non recurring transactions noted above the operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 2 222 for the fourth quarter of 2018 finance expense amounted to 501 compared to 159 for the corresponding period of 2017 excluding the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap of 283 2017 unrealized gain of 123 finance expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased to 218 compared to 282 for the corresponding quarter of 2017 the following paragraphs explain each operating business segment in more detail masonry products for the year ended december 31 2018 revenues increased to 111 570 from 110 433 in 2017 higher shipments in the first half of 2018 were supported by higher multi family housing starts a reduction in the backlog of residential construction carried forward from 2017 and higher demand for new products however in the second half of 2018 the pace of home construction in ontario pared back following the introduction of fiscal measures to curb the rise in housing demand cost of sales decreased to 82 895 from 85 799 in 2017 the cost of sales from higher shipments was offset by the favourable impact of lower required repair and maintenance costs in 2018 lower natural gas costs and improved efficiencies in electric power consumption largely attributed to the brampton clay brick facility in addition higher production volumes and cost effective improvements in the product mix at the farmersburg indiana clay brick plant positively contributed to lower per unit production costs in the company s masonry concrete plant network higher production volumes had a favourable impact on cost of sales however this benefit was offset in part by higher freight costs for product transfers to facilitate customer deliveries no asset impairment charge was recorded during 2018 2017 6 285 operating income from the masonry products business segment for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 14 275 compared to an operating income of 3 502 in 2017 excluding the impairment loss of 6 285 on the farmersburg indiana clay brick plant in 2017 the operating income for the prior year was 9 787 for the fourth quarter of 2018 revenues were 22 326 compared to 26 069 for the corresponding quarter in 2017 fourth quarter shipments of 2018 were affected by the moderated pace of residential construction following the introduction of mandated fiscal measures adopted in the canadian mortgage market as well as the non resident speculation tax imposed in the province of ontario to curtail overheated housing market conditions in ontario cost of sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased to 18 448 from 21 009 for the corresponding prior quarter of 2017 the decrease in cost of sales from lower shipments was partially offset by higher per unit manufacturing costs on lower production volumes the operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 429 compared to operating loss of 4 995 for the corresponding quarter in 2017 excluding the impact of the asset impairment charge of 6 285 the operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1 290 landscape products revenues of the landscape products business segment for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 48 212 from 45 811 in 2017 due to a significant increase in shipments this increase was supported by strong first half shipments under the 2017 2018 dealer winter booking program that were deferred from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to production capacity constraints in the company s landscape product facilities in 2017 the winter booking program is a landscape sales program designed to help the company s dealer network pre order landscape inventory in the fourth quarter of the year to ensure that dealer inventory levels are optimized prior to the commencement of the seasonal sales increase in the spring and summer months unfavourable weather conditions in the spring and the subdued pace of economic activity impacted landscape shipments in the second half of 2018 these decreases were offset by higher revenues under the 2018 2019 dealer winter booking program during the fourth quarter of 2018 cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2018 increased to 36 841 compared to 32 508 in 2017 the increase was due to higher shipments but was favourably impacted by lower per unit manufacturing costs on comparatively higher production volumes higher freight costs on product transfers to meet customer demand and higher selling expenses were incurred as described under the discussion of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 the operating income of the landscape products business segment decreased to 4 734 from 6 359 for the prior year the operating income of the landscape products business segment was 1 702 for the fourth quarter of 2018 on revenues of 11 883 compared to operating income of 932 on revenues of 10 498 for the fourth quarter of 2017 cash flows for the year ended december 31 2018 cash provided from operating activities decreased to 18 922 from 21 960 in 2017 the decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to higher disbursements of trade payables this decrease was offset by an improvement in operating income production plant efficiencies higher collections of trade and other receivables

us economist nouriel roubini chairman roubini global economics speaks on the economies of indonesia india and china at the start of the asia pacific economic cooperation apec ceo summit in nusa dua bali indonesia 05 october 2013 indonesia s resort island of bali is hosting the apec summit and apec ceo summit until 08 october 2013 epa dennis m sabangan the us federal reserve surprised markets recently with a large and unexpected policy change when the federal open market committee fomc met in december 2018 it hiked the fed s policy rate to 2 25 2 5 and signalled that it would raise the benchmark rate another three times to 3 3 25 before stopping it also signalled that it would continue to unwind its balance sheet of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities indefinitely by up to 50 billion a month but just six weeks later at the fomc meeting in late january the fed indicated that it would pause its rate hikes for the foreseeable future and suspend its balance sheet unwinding sometime in 2019 several factors drove the fed s volte face first and foremost policymakers were rattled by the sharp tightening in financial conditions after the fomc s december meeting which hastened a rout in global equity markets that had begun in october 2018 and these fears were exacerbated by an appreciating us dollar and the possibility of an effective shutdown of certain credit markets particularly those for high yield and leveraged loans second in the latter half of 2018 us core inflation unexpectedly stopped rising toward the fed s 2 target and even started falling toward 1 8 with inflation expectations weakening the fed was forced to reconsider its rate hike plan which was based on the belief that structurally low unemployment would drive inflation above 2 third us president donald trump s trade wars and slowing growth in europe china japan and emerging markets have raised concerns about the united states own growth prospects particularly after the protracted federal government shutdown with which the us met the new year fourth the fed has had to demonstrate its independence in the face of political pressures in december when it signalled further rate hikes trump had been calling for a pause but since then the fed has had to worry about being blamed in the event of an economic stall fifth richard clarida a well respected economist and market expert joined the fed board as vice chair in the fall of 2018 tipping the balance of the fomc in a more dovish direction before then fed chair jerome powell s own dovish tendencies had been kept in check by a slightly less dovish staff and the third member of the fed s leadership troika new york fed president john williams who expected inflation to rise gradually above target as the labour market tightened the addition of clarida amid stalling inflation and tightening financial conditions no doubt proved decisive in the fed s decision to hit the pause button but clarida also seems to have pushed the fed toward renewed dovishness in more subtle ways for starters his presence lends support to powell s view that the flattening of the phillips curve which asserts an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment may be more structural than temporary some fed researchers disagree and have published a paper arguing that uncertainty with respect to the phillips curve should not stop the fed from normalising us monetary policy but with clarida s input the fed will be more inclined to focus on actual inflation trends rather than on the official unemployment rate and its implications under traditional models moreover while fed staff members tend to believe that the us economy s rate of potential growth is very low around 1 75 2 clarida like powell seems open to the idea that trump s tax cuts and deregulatory policies combined with the next wave of technological innovation will allow for somewhat stronger non inflationary growth finally clarida is spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the fed should start making up for below target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by allowing for above target inflation during expansionary periods and though the review is still in its early stages the fed already seems to have embraced the idea that inflation should be allowed to exceed 2 without immediately triggering a tightening taken together these factors suggest that the fed could remain in pause mode for the rest of 2019 after all even a recent modest acceleration of wage growth does not seem to have produced higher inflation implying that the phillips curve may stay flatter for longer and given the fed s new de facto policy of targeting average inflation over the course of the business cycle a modest temporary increase in core inflation above 2 would not necessarily be met with policy action but while the fed is most likely to remain in a holding pattern for the bulk of 2019 another rate hike toward the end of the year or in 2020 cannot be ruled out china s growth slowdown seems to be bottoming out and recovery there could start to strengthen in the coming months especially if the current sino american negotiations lead to a de escalation of trade tensions likewise a deal to avert an economically disastrous hard brexit could still be in the offing and it is possible that the eurozone s slowdown especially germany s will prove temporary moreover global financial conditions are easing as a result of the fed and other central banks renewed dovishness and this could translate into stronger us domestic growth much will depend on whether trump abstains from launching a separate trade war against the european auto industry which would rattle equity markets again yet barring more fights over the us federal budget and the debt ceiling not to mention possible impeachment proceedings against trump the us could be spared serious domestic political and policy shocks in the months ahead if us gdp growth does remain resilient in 2019 some acceleration of wage growth and price inflation could follow and core inflation may even rise above target in the second half of the year or 2020 and while the fed seems willing to tolerate a period of temporary above target inflation it cannot allow that to become the new status quo should this scenario arise later in 2019 or 2020 the fed could hike its baseline rate by another 25 basis points before settling into a protracted pause either way the new normal will be a us policy rate close to or just below 3 project syndicate dm nouriel

washington dc mar 19 ips era dabla norris is a division chief in the imf s fiscal affairs department and kalpana kochhar is director of the imf s human resources department as girls we were raised with the belief that we could accomplish anything and that no barrier was insurmountable yet for so many women the reality doesn t quite meet their aspirations things weren t exactly equal in the relatively conservative middle class society in india where we both grew up but we thought of gender inequality as largely an issue of social justice it was only after we started delving into the topic that we came to realize that it is an equally significant economic issue women make up almost half of the world s working age population of nearly 5 billion people but only about 50 percent of those women participate in the labor force compared with 80 percent of men not only is female labor force participation lower but women who are paid for their work are disproportionately employed in the informal sector especially in developing economies where employers are subject to fewer regulations leaving workers more vulnerable to lower wages and job losses furthermore even in the formal sector women doing the same work and having the same level of education earn less than their male counterparts and because women generally spend less time in the paid labor market they have lower pensions and face a higher risk of poverty in old age among those who do work few rise to senior positions or start their own businesses women also shoulder a higher share of unpaid work within the family including childcare and domestic tasks which can limit their opportunity to engage in paid work and constrain their options when they do the imf s research highlights how the uneven playing field between women and men imposes large costs on the global economy early imf studies on the economic impact of gender gaps assumed that men and women were likely to be born with the same potential but that disparities in access to education health care and finance and technology legal rights and social and cultural factors prevented women from realizing that potential in turn these barriers facing women shrank the pool of talent available to employers kochhar jain chandra and newiak 2017 the result was lower productivity and lower economic growth the losses to an economy from economic disempowerment of women were estimated to range from 10 percent of gdp in advanced economies to more than 30 percent in south asia and in the middle east and north africa more recent research suggests that the economic benefits of bringing more women into the labor force exceed previous estimates this is because women and men may have the same potential but they bring different skills and ideas that are economically valuable to the table ostry and others 2018 gender differences may reflect social norms and their impact on upbringing social interactions risk preferences and response to incentives for instance studies have found women to be more risk averse reflecting greater fear of failure and less competitive women s greater caution has benefits gender balanced corporate boards improve firm performance especially in high tech manufacturing and knowledge intensive services gender diversity on boards of banking supervision agencies is also associated with greater financial stability sahay and čihák 2018 similarly banks with higher shares of women board members have thicker capital buffers a lower proportion of nonperforming loans and greater resistance to stress possibly because having more women in executive positions contributes to diversity and complementarity of thought leading to better decision making drawing on macroeconomic sectoral and firm level data a recent imf study ostry and others 2018 suggests that men and women complement each other in the workplace in terms of different skills and perspectives including different attitudes toward risk and collaboration as a result increasing women s employment boosts growth and incomes more than previously estimated exceeding the improvement that comes simply from adding workers among countries where gaps in participation rates are the largest closing them adds 35 percent to gdp on average four fifths of the gains come from adding workers to the labor force but fully one fifth arises from the boost to productivity brought by greater gender diversity the study also shows that increasing women s labor force participation produces large gains in economic welfare which account for changes in consumption goods home production and leisure time these gains exceed 20 percent in south asia and the middle east and north africa see chart 1 another important finding when more women participate in the labor force men also benefit why because women s complementary skills raise productivity boosting wages for everyone this increase in productivity more than makes up for the decline in wages that might be expected when more workers are competing for jobs but simply bringing more women into the workforce may not be enough a recent imf study sounds a cautionary note on the challenges women face in a rapidly changing labor market brussevich and others 2018 digitalization artificial intelligence and machine learning are hollowing out jobs that involve routine and repetitive tasks while increasing the value of jobs involving management and cognitive skills hard won gains from policies to increase the number of women in the paid workforce and close wage gaps may be quickly eroded if women are overrepresented in jobs at high risk of automation indeed the study finds that women perform more routine tasks than men across all sectors and occupations although there is significant variation across countries the risk of displacement is particularly high for less educated women those aged 40 and above and those in low skill clerical and sales jobs meanwhile women across sectors and occupations are underrepresented in professional and managerial positions that are at lower risk of displacement by technology globally women hold fewer than 20 percent of board seats in banks and bank supervision agencies sahay and čihák 2018 and account for fewer than 2 percent of bank ceos in the fast growing tech sector women are 15 percent less likely than men to be managers and professionals and 19 percent more likely to be clerks and service workers see chart 2 given the current state of technology the study estimates that 26 million women s jobs in 30 countries 28 countries in the organisation for economic co operation and development plus cyprus and singapore have a greater than 70 percent chance of being displaced by technology within two decades on a global scale this suggests that 180 million women s jobs are at risk while more men than women are at risk of being displaced by automation the number of female jobs lost represents a larger proportion of the female labor force what can be done because gender inequality is so multifaceted there is no single remedy and the best policy approach will vary across countries depending on the level of economic development existing gender gaps and the speed at which the new technology affects the economy three broad areas can be highlighted first policies to bring more women into the workforce a range of institutional legal regulatory and fiscal policy levers have been shown to boost female labor force participation while there is no one size fits all solution policies should seek to foster opportunity and remove barriers policies and infrastructure that make it easier for women to reconcile work and family life are particularly effective emerging market and developing economies should invest in infrastructure in rural south africa for example electrification increased female labor force participation by 9 percent in india building adequate sanitation facilities narrowed gender gaps in education and in female labor force participation mexico introduced public buses exclusively for women to ensure that they could travel safely support female entrepreneurs by increasing their access to finance women often face more restrictive collateral requirements shorter maturity of loans and higher interest rates than men see banking on the future of women in this issue of f d initiatives such as malaysia s women entrepreneur financing programme and chile s simplified deposit accounts have helped close the gender gap in borrowing rates promote equal rights for women measures include addressing laws governing inheritance and property rights malawi namibia and peru revised their legal frameworks to reduce gender discrimination in the decade that followed female labor force participation rates increased substantially in all three countries advanced economies should push for greater parity between maternity and paternity leave in sweden this has helped mothers return to work more rapidly and has shifted underlying gender norms about parenting promote access to affordable high quality childcare an example is japan which expanded childcare leave benefits from 50 percent to 67 percent of salary research shows that cutting the cost of childcare by half could increase the number of young mothers in the labor market by 10 percent there is also considerable evidence that women are more responsive to specific tax policies than men these include policies that do not penalize the secondary earner who is still most likely to be female by replacing family taxation with individual taxation as canada italy and sweden have done tax relief measures for low income families have also been found to increase employment rates for women the reason tax relief reduces the tax burden and increases after tax earnings for women thus increasing the incentive for women to join or remain in the labor force examples include the earned income tax credit in the united states and a combination of tax credits and transfers in belgium germany and the united kingdom second policies to provide women with the right skills and to empower women in the workplace gender parity in investments in education and health are necessary to ensure that women can obtain quality jobs in india for instance imf research suggests that female labor force participation would rise by 2 percentage points if indian states increased education spending by 1 percent of gdp building skills early would also provide the most important safeguard against displacement by technology and allow women to benefit from new work opportunities for those already in the workforce fiscal instruments such as tax deductions for training in the netherlands and portable individual learning accounts in france can remove barriers to lifelong learning countries could also consider subsidizing training by private companies via dedicated payroll taxes and public grants concerted efforts are needed to provide women with more opportunities to rise into managerial and leadership roles by setting relevant recruitment and retention targets for organizations setting promotion quotas as was done in norway and creating mentorship and training programs large gender gaps persist in access to the digital technology that creates new job opportunities 60 percent of the global population mostly women in emerging market and developing economies still have no access to the internet 250 million fewer women are online than men public and private investment will be essential to support technological adoption and close digital gender gaps finland s approach to ensuring universal access to broadband connectivity digital education for all and digital access to business and government services is a good example of a comprehensive approach to closing the gender digital divide third easing transitions for displaced workers given that female workers face a particularly high risk of being displaced through automation it will be essential to ensure equal support for displaced men and women through labor market policies to improve skills connect workers with jobs and promote job creation social protection systems will also need to adapt to more flexible forms of work such as telework to address deteriorating income security associated with rapid technological change some advanced economies may consider expanding noncontributory pensions and adopting basic income guarantees recent decades have seen considerable progress in leveling the playing field for economic opportunities but much more work remains to be done the good news is that countries across the globe have embraced the imperative for gender equality policymakers governments and corporations now recognize the benefits for economic growth and development of giving women equal opportunities and they are seeking to improve their policies and practices in this area the imf is committed to working with other international organizations governments civil society organizations and the private sector to reduce barriers to gender equality by providing policy advice and analysis

underpinning the recovery will be the continuing primary to the point of being exclusive focus by monetary policymakers on the need to extend the expansion we also believe the most underappreciated theme continues to be the extraordinarily subdued inflation rates around the globe in the us the federal reserve fed has missed its inflation target and forecasts for each of the last seven years and looks ready to add 2019 as its eighth nine years into the us expansion and inflation has yet to reach the fed s 2 per cent target despite massive monetary and fiscal stimulus the global inflation rate which flirted with zero as recently as 2016 has once again been subject to downward revisions after the 2017 and early 2018 bounces below trend core inflation allows central banks the very long leash to get and or keep interest rates low and until growth picks up substantially enough to bring these inflation rates back to life rather than central bank forecasts that they may come back to life interest rate hikes are off the table in today s debt laden subpar expansion monetary policy endeavours to stay accommodative until growth resurges and presents an opportunity to restart normalisation then very modest incremental changes can be enacted with constant vigilance to stop should growth stall in the us the window of opportunity to raise rates looked wide open with the economy accelerating to over 3 5 per cent growth annualised in the middle two quarters of the year inching the fed funds rate up three times seemed non controversial but by december 2018 the us economy was downshifting quickly and the global picture was also weakening in this environment a fed pause was called for having guided the markets so clearly to expect a december hike the fed followed through but then executed a pause to a wait and see approach the fed clearly expected that the fed funds rate level would be at the very low end of the normal range it is not absolutely clear cut though that today s rate is at the bottom of that range in addition to below target inflation growth in 4q18 may come in close to 1 per cent and 1q19 is off to a slow start maybe as we expect this lull in growth is temporary it is also possible that the fed funds rate is already sufficient the primacy of the objective of extending the expansion means that a high degree of certainty must be attained before tightening can re commence some fed members seem confident that such conditions may come back into evidence but the leadership of the fed what might be lightly dubbed the holy trinity the fed chair vice chair and ny fed president are all on message they are dutifully nudging market participants to understand that conditions must change substantially john williams president of the new york fed made this point explicitly this week but it would be a different outlook either for growth or inflation to return to hiking rates this echoes fed chair jerome powell s comments at his january press conference i would want to see a need for further rate increases the economy will have to pick up speed for an extended period bringing inflation with it before the fed will tighten again globally monetary policymakers have been in a more accommodative mode than the us has been in for quite some time as growth and inflation remain below target levels indeed the fear here is that growth will continue to weaken it was the global weakness in conjunction with fears of sustained us monetary policy tightening and a potential trade war that caused risk assets to perform so badly last year the question then becomes can growth remain sturdy european growth is off to a very slow start after last year s downshift to trend from above trend growth in 2017 chinese growth continues to be soggy japanese growth downshifted and non china emerging markets em are trying to shake off the negative effects of last year s brutal combination of both downwardly revised global growth and higher us interest rates clearly the need to monitor further downside challenges is acute however some of the factors that drove last year s extreme pessimism are fading two negatives that may be abating revolve around china coming into last year chinese policy was in a deleveraging mode as the debt burdens and shadow banking system were being reduced belated recognition and an early underestimation of the severity and probable longevity of the trade and economic tensions with the us led to further shortfalls in growth but the need to shore up growth as the challenge of competition with the us becomes more pronounced has led to extensive policy stimulus china has cut interest rates and reserve requirements it has cut individual tax rates and moved to increased fiscal stimulus most tellingly china has very publicly trumpeted the need to reinvigorate the private sector virtually reversing last year s program of squeezing private sector borrowers these policy measures will take hold with a lag and therefore economic indicators may not turn decisively up for some time but a long rounding bottom is our base case for china with growth in the second half of 2019 being better than in the first in conjunction with the better economic outlook the prospects for a dampening of the trade tensions that were so disruptive to global growth seem to be in store the politics of slamming china publicly played well as long as there was little actual or perceived cost but with the downshifting of growth both the us and china have strong incentives to reach a bargain and have been signalling the likelihood of such an outcome we do not expect such a deal to come remotely close to resolving all the issues and expect the economic competition to be a central theme going forward but we do expect the attenuation of investment projects as uncertainty mounted late last year will subside we expect modest close to trend growth of 1 25 1 5 per cent in europe last year the european downshift in growth was additionally clouded by italian reticence to accommodate eu budgetary rules the continuing saga and risk of brexit and political turmoil in france the question is whether worst case tail risks in these countries will come to pass brexit remains unsettled but our team continues to expect that a hard brexit will be avoided we delve more deeply into our views on the topic in gordon brown s recent paper brexit deal or no deal or something in between in italy despite its limping economy the italians willingness to play ball with the eu keeps the european central bank on its side and in france recent economic perkiness may reinforce the notion that chaotic politics is just par for the course the central point here is that given the pessimism about european growth the hurdle for having a better outcome may well be a little over 1 per cent growth for the year emerging markets were hit with a plethora of challenges last year higher us interest rates and an ever stronger dollar led to funding and liquidity challenges at the same time fears of slower global growth emanating particularly from china and europe increased downside risks lower commodity prices were a further challenge a full blown trade war and the resulting reversal in global trade posed a potential nightmare threat the resulting sum of these risk premia for all these challenges led to spectacular underperformance of this asset class last year it also led to em local debt being priced at an 18 year low as shown in exhibit 1 many of these headwinds are not only abating however they are reversing as well fed tightening is no longer in prospect an ever stronger dollar seems unlikely chinese growth could move from a headwind to a tailwind and a much more sober approach to global trade resolution may be in the offing exhibit 1 jp morgan gbi em global div price index source bloomberg as of 31 dec 18 we believe the severe underperformance of spread sectors to global sovereign bonds last year presents a very meaningful opportunity the expectation or fears of further slowing growth and further fed tightening may both be misplaced a meaningful diminution of trade tensions would be a further positive development clearly there are many sources of concern we are particularly focused on protecting downside risks the very low rate of global inflation is clearly a very serious yellow light with respect to global growth prospects but the same dampened inflation strongly suggests we can lean on our expectation of very dovish monetary policy to use government duration as a complement to overweights in spread sectors ken leech chief investment officer western asset are we on the road to global economic recovery our view is that the us and global expansion will continue albeit at a very slow pace allowing a sustained rebound in spread sectors ken leech last updated 19 march 2019 published 19 march 2019
oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

i first suggested the u s economy was headed toward a recession more than a year ago and now others are forecasting the same i give a business downturn starting this year a two thirds probability the recessionary indicators are numerous tighter monetary policy by the federal reserve that the central bank now worries it may have overdone the near inversion in the treasury yield curve the swoon in stocks at the end of last year weaker housing activity soft consumer spending the tiny 20 000 increase in february payrolls compared to the 223 000 monthly average gain last year then there are the effects of the deteriorating european economies and decelerating growth in china as well as president donald trump s ongoing trade war with that country there is of course a small chance of a soft landing such as in the mid 1990s at that time the fed ended its interest rate hiking cycle and cut the federal funds rate with no ensuing recession by my count the other 12 times the central bank restricted credit in the post world war ii era a recession resulted it s also possible that the current economic softening is temporary but a revival would bring more fed restraint policy makers want higher rates in order to have significant room to cut in the next recession and the current 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent range doesn t give them much leeway the fed also dislikes investors zeal for riskier assets from hedge funds to private equity and leveraged loans to say nothing of that rankest of rank speculations bitcoin with a resumption in economic growth a tight credit induced recession would be postponed until 2020 recession conjures up specters of 2007 2009 the most severe business downturn since the 1930s in which the s p 500 index plunged 57 percent from its peak to its trough the fed raised its target rate from 1 percent in june 2004 to 5 25 percent in june 2006 but the main event was the financial crisis spawned by the collapse in the vastly inflated subprime mortgage market similarly the central bank increased its policy rate from 4 75 percent in june 1999 to 6 5 percent in may 2000 still the mild 2001 recession that followed was principally driven by the collapse in the late 1990s dot com bubble that pushed the tech laden nasdaq composite index down by a whopping 78 percent the 1973 1975 recession the second deepest since the 1930s resulted from the collapse in the early 1970s inflation hedge buying of excess inventories that deflated the s p 500 by 48 2 percent the federal funds rate hike from 9 percent in february 1974 to 13 percent in july of that year was a minor contributor the remaining eight post world war ii recessions were not the result of major financial or economic excesses but just the normal late economic cycle business and investor overconfidence the average drop in the s p 500 was 21 2 percent at present i don t see any major economic or financial bubbles that are just begging to be pricked the only possibilities are excess debt among u s nonfinancial corporations and the heavy borrowing in dollars by emerging market economies in the face of a rising greenback housing never fully recovered from the subprime mortgage debacle the financial sector is still deleveraging in the wake of the financial crisis consumer debt remains substantial but well off its 2008 peak in relation to household income consequently the recession i foresee will probably be accompanied by about an average drop in stock prices the s p 500 fell 19 6 percent from oct 3 to dec 24 but the recovery since has almost eliminated that loss a normal recession related decline of 21 2 percent meeting the definition of a bear market from that oct 3 top would take it to 2 305 down about 18 percent from friday s close but not much below the christmas eve low of 2 351 shilling is president of a gary shilling co a new jersey consultancy a registered investment advisor and author of the age of deleveraging investment strategies for a decade of slow growth and deflation some portfolios he manages invest in currencies and commodities

arriving at non gaap presentations companies generally factor out items such as those that have a non recurring impact on the income statements various non cash items significant effects of

the company believes that non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company s results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate the company s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures investors should consider non gaap financial measures in

the result of multiple growth initiatives currently under execution most significantly growth in our micro beaded fertilizer and international businesses there is also a shift in our product mix away from third party products resulting in an improvement in gross margin profiles although these numbers have exceeded our initial projections for the reported period we are not revising at this time our projections for our fiscal year 2019 said federico trucco ceo of bioceres crop solutions over the past two quarters we have been able to accomplish consistent growth in revenues while increasing our

unanticipated events or otherwise non ifrs financial information we supplement the use of ifrs financial measures with non ifrs financial measures including adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as profit loss exclusive of financial income costs income tax benefit expense depreciation amortization share based compensation and inventory purchase allocation we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful supplemental information to investors about us and our results adjusted ebitda is among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our financial and operating performance and make day to day financial and operating decisions in addition adjusted ebitda and similarly titled measures are frequently used by our competitors rating agencies securities analysts investors and other parties to evaluate companies in our industry we also believe that adjusted ebitda is helpful to investors because it provides additional information about trends in our core operating performance prior to considering the impact of capital structure depreciation amortization and taxation on our results adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with ifrs adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool including adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in including cash requirements for our working capital needs or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda does not reflect our financial expenses or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness or interest income or other financial income adjusted ebitda does not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated or amortized often will need to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacements although share based compensation is a non cash charge adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of share based compensation and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and similarly titled measures differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure we compensate for the inherent limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda through disclosure of these limitations presentation of our combined financial statements in accordance with ifrs and reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable ifrs measure income loss for the period or year application of ias 29 argentina has been classified as a hyperinflationary economy under the terms of ias 29 from july 1 2018 ias 29 requires to adjust all non monetary items in the statement of financial position by applying a general price index from the day they were booked to the end of the reporting period at the same time it also requires that all items in the statement of income are expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period consequently on a monthly basis results of operations for each reporting period are measured in argentine pesos and adjusted for inflation by the applicable monthly inflation rate each month all amounts need to be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates when the items of income and expenses were initially recorded in the financial statements as a result each monthly results of operations are readjusted each successive month to reflect changes in the monthly inflation rate after the restatement explained above ias 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates addresses the way results must be translated under inflation accounting stating that all amounts shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of the most recent statement of financial position accordingly monthly results of operations in argentine pesos after adjustment for inflation pursuant to ias 29 as described above must then be converted into u s dollars at the closing exchange rate for such monthly reported period this conversion changes every prior reported monthly statement of income in u s dollars as each monthly amount is readjusted under ias 29 for inflation per above and reconverted at different exchange rates for each monthly reported period under ias 21 as a result the impact of monthly inflationary adjustments and monthly conversion adjustments vary the results of operation month to month until year end table 1 consolidated statement of comprehensive income six

reduction and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the pfg s credit agreement and indenture other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the adjusted ebitda contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date under pfg s credit agreement and indenture pfg s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit

calculation of adjusted ebitda as well as certain one time income tax items to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable gaap financial measure pfg believes that the presentation

china is making major cuts in electricity rates to support business and its sagging economy raising questions about government subsidies and environmental concerns on march 9 china s central electric utility state grid corp announced a 10 percent reduction in average electricity charges for business users this year to relieve the burden on the real economy the official xinhua news agency said the break comes on top of a 10 6 percent rate cut for commercial users in 2018 that saved china s businesses 79 2 billion yuan u s 11 7 billion according to the report with industrial users included the assistance last year totaled 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 6 billion the state owned utility said while state controlled rates are subject to change the announcement appeared to be unusual in citing the economic benefit as the purpose without any reference to market conditions fuel prices or generating costs the moves posed a host of policy questions about regulation in the power sector pricing reform and the potential for anti competitive industrial subsidies the huge drop in electricity bills also highlighted the government s all out response to china s economic slowdown which has so far included tax cuts infrastructure spending and a surge in bank loans although the cost of the combined rate cuts for 2018 and 2019 appears to be substantial the announcement did not specify whether the state grid power producers or the government would pay for it according to the xinhua report the state grid topped the list of china s largest companies last year with revenue of 2 36 trillion yuan u s 351 7 billion suggesting that the utility could cover the cost but the company s total profit fell 14 3 percent from a year earlier dropping for the first time in five years an analysis by hong kong based ping an securities said the burden of the break the burden of last year s break fell mostly on grid companies although some provinces reduced on grid tariffs for coal fired generators said philip andrews speed a principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the plan this year calls for the coal fired power plants to pay for the rate reductions for business consumers since most or all of the provinces are expected to cut their on grid tariffs the coal fired generators are complaining now which is quite justified andrews speed said overcapacity of generation has drastically reduced their operating hours and is squeezing margins and now they are getting lower tariffs some for the second year running he said the government s decision to manipulate electricity rates for the purpose of economic stimulus is seen as a setback for energy reforms these measures completely undermine the development of the power market andrews speed said this has been announced at a time when the government is claiming to be liberalizing the power market by allowing generators to sell to large users at tariffs to be set by negotiation and allowing a proliferation of power retailers he said in his annual work report to the national people s congress on march 5 premier li keqiang suggested that the government would advance reforms and set lower

by rfa by michael lelyveld china is making major cuts in electricity rates to support business and its sagging economy raising questions about government subsidies and environmental concerns on march 9 china s central electric utility state grid corp announced a 10 percent reduction in average electricity charges for business users this year to relieve the burden on the real economy the official xinhua news agency said the break comes on top of a 10 6 percent rate cut for commercial users in 2018 that saved china s businesses 79 2 billion yuan u s 11 7 billion according to the report with industrial users included the assistance last year totaled 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 6 billion the state owned utility said while state controlled rates are subject to change the announcement appeared to be unusual in citing the economic benefit as the purpose without any reference to market conditions fuel prices or generating costs the moves posed a host of policy questions about regulation in the power sector pricing reform and the potential for anti competitive industrial subsidies the huge drop in electricity bills also highlighted the government s all out response to china s economic slowdown which has so far included tax cuts infrastructure spending and a surge in bank loans although the cost of the combined rate cuts for 2018 and 2019 appears to be substantial the announcement did not specify whether the state grid power producers or the government would pay for it according to the xinhua report the state grid topped the list of china s largest companies last year with revenue of 2 36 trillion yuan u s 351 7 billion suggesting that the utility could cover the cost but the company s total profit fell 14 3 percent from a year earlier dropping for the first time in five years an analysis by hong kong based ping an securities said the burden of the break the burden of last year s break fell mostly on grid companies although some provinces reduced on grid tariffs for coal fired generators said philip andrews speed a principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the plan this year calls for the coal fired power plants to pay for the rate reductions for business consumers since most or all of the provinces are expected to cut their on grid tariffs the coal fired generators are complaining now which is quite justified andrews speed said overcapacity of generation has drastically reduced their operating hours and is squeezing margins and now they are getting lower tariffs some for the second year running he said the government s decision to manipulate electricity rates for the purpose of economic stimulus is seen as a setback for energy reforms these measures completely undermine the development of the power market andrews speed said this has been announced at a time when the government is claiming to be liberalizing the power market by allowing generators to sell to large users at tariffs to be set by negotiation and allowing a proliferation of power retailers he said in his annual work report to the national people s congress on march 5 premier li keqiang suggested that the government would advance reforms and set lower electricity rates at the same time we will deepen electric power market reforms overhaul electricity price surcharges reduce the electricity usage cost for the manufacturing industry and reduce the average electricity price of general industrial and commercial industry by another 10 percent li said from an environmental standpoint large rate cuts are also

limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate pfg s financial performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted diluted eps as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because of varying methods of calculation management uses adjusted ebitda defined as net income before interest expense interest income income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items we do not consider part of our core operating results such adjustments include certain unusual non cash non recurring cost reduction and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the pfg s credit agreement and indenture other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the adjusted ebitda contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date under pfg s credit agreement and indenture pfg s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and indenture management also uses adjusted diluted eps which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by excluding the same items excluded in pfg s calculation of adjusted ebitda as well as certain one time income tax items to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable gaap financial measure pfg believes that the presentation

amol agrawal after thomas piketty s works on inequality if there is something that has stormed the economic world it is modern monetary theory mmt just like piketty mmt has achieved both a rock star appeal and invited criticism from economists the social media is rife with discussions on mmt story continues below advertisement remove ad what is mmt actually it is not a modern theory of money as its term suggests but a combination of several historical ideas on evolution of money there are broadly two thoughts on the advent of money the first is that money evolved naturally or spontaneously as humans figured money as a better way for exchanging goods and services compared to barter the second is that money evolved due to the state which via its system of taxation and expenditure led to money the state by its authority prescribed only a certain form of money as legal tender and accepted its taxes only in that legal tender leading to certain forms of money having precedence over others mmt takes its origins from the second thought and takes the idea forward the core of mmt is that as the state has monopoly over currency via the central bank it can run its deficits without bothering about any constraints to finance the deficit we usually think that government receives taxes first and then spends but mmters say it is the opposite government spends first and then receives the taxes in fact its adherents say that government borrowing is a misnomer as the government is getting its own issued currency notes and nobody can borrow its own notes the mmters further argue that based on this reasoning the government can finance infrastructure projects and even fund job guarantee schemes to remove involuntary unemployment for many economists mmt reads like the often criticised policy in economics called debt monetisation under debt monetisation the government monetises its debt by issuing bonds and asks the central bank to buy those bonds this is what was happening in india too in the 1950s the government initially asked rbi to monetise its debt which became automatic as the debt was financed continuously this resulted in the government not caring about its widening fiscal deficit resulting in high inflation the 1991 crisis is often seen as a fiscal deficit crisis first before it became a balance of payments problem as part of the 1991 reforms rbi and government phased out this practice ending it in 1997 in fact this problem of deficit financing was not limited to india alone but has been a bane of many countries most episodes of hyperinflation also go back to similar linkages between debt and money given this broad sweep why would mmt folks support these ideas the answer is conditions in developed countries have surprised the economists as the global financial crisis hit world economies and central banks cut rates to zero levels and infused liquidity like never before there was a feeling that inflation would soon hit these economies after all before mmt took centre stage the quantity theory of money held that too much money leads to more inflation in the economy however this has hardly been the case with most developed economies struggling with low inflation the economists are debating whether the phillips curve has flattened which means that a large change in unemployment will only bring about a marginal change in inflation this is quite surprising as it was felt central banks could easily create inflation but it has not been the case despite large scale monetary infusions by these institutions another variable which has surprised is the low interest rates on bonds it was widely felt that with rising debt and deficit levels in developed economies interest rates on bonds will increase sharply however this has also been missing with the yield curve remaining much lower than expected both missing inflation and lower than expected interest rates have led to the emergence of mmt the supporters say that as inflation has been absent despite high debt and monetary stimulus it shows mmt has been working they also draw inspiration from the japanese case where despite years of monetary easing and high debt levels inflation levels have barely increased thus they argue the us could also take advantage of similar conditions and its government could spend without worrying about inflation story continues below advertisement remove ad in fact what mmters have been saying is not very different from mainstream economists such as lawrence summers and olivier blanchard both have been arguing that the us government should take advantage of lower interest rates and issue more debt to finance the next generation infrastructure education demands and so on hence both camps believe that the us should take advantage of this situation but the modes of financing are different the mmt camp believes that spending can be financed by the central bank whereas the mainstream camp believes it can be financed by financial markets the supporters of mmt draw their inspiration from jm keynes abba lerner and hyman minsky whose works have become popular during the financial crisis currently mmt ideas are led by economists such as stephanie kelton stony brook university also an adviser to us presidential candidate bernie sanders and l randall wray levy economics institute at bard college their ideas have got even more criticism as they represent mainly heterodox schools summers recently dubbed mmt as fallacious and remarked that these new ideas are being oversimplified and exaggerated by fringe economists they also criticise that mmt would lead to hyperinflation this is unduly harsh and mean as summers himself has similar ideas as shown above second ideas can come from anywhere and history tells us fringe ideas eventually go onto rule the world third by naming them fringe economists we are again seeing the mainstream economists make the same mistake of hubris and arrogance they showed before 2008 crisis in my view mmt is neither modern nor a monetary theory really it is more like this special case which can be applied to certain economies given their existing economic conditions these conditions exist in the us japan and some of the european conditions neil irwin recently commented in the new york times that mmt should first be tried in a small country as applying it in the us would be risky given its size but then it is difficult to find any such country the small emerging markets are unlikely to try it as most have suffered inflation due to similar fiscal ideas even some of the european countries are likely to reject it given their history of hyperinflation japan could be interesting but it is going through its own problems and has already done many policy experiments to get out of the situation thus it is only us where these ideas can be applied and that is also the place where it is being widely discussed as well amol agrawal is faculty at ahmedabad university views are personal
as alarm bells sound over the advancing destruction of the environment a variety of green new deal proposals have appeared in the u s and europe along with some interesting academic debates about how to fund them monetary policy normally relegated to obscure academic tomes and bureaucratic meetings behind closed doors has suddenly taken center stage the 14 page proposal for a green new deal submitted to the u s house of representatives by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y does not actually mention modern monetary theory mmt but that is the approach currently capturing the attention of the media and taking most of the heat the concept is good abundance can be ours without worrying about taxes or debt at least until we hit full productive capacity but as with most theories the devil is in the details mmt advocates say the government does not need to collect taxes before it spends it actually creates new money in the process of spending it and there is plenty of room in the economy for public spending before demand outstrips supply driving up prices critics however insist this is not true the government is not allowed to spend before it has the money in its account and the money must come from tax revenues or bond sales in a 2013 treatise called modern monetary theory 101 a reply to critics mmt academics concede this point but they write these constraints do not change the end result and here the argument gets a bit technical their reasoning is that the fed is the monopoly supplier of cb currency treasury spends by using cb currency and since the treasury obtained cb currency by taxing and issuing treasuries cb currency must be injected before taxes and bond offerings can occur the counterargument made by american monetary institute ami researchers among others is that the central bank is not the monopoly supplier of dollars the vast majority of the dollars circulating in the united states are created not by the government but by private banks when they make loans the fed accommodates this process by supplying central bank currency bank reserves as needed and this bank created money can be taxed or borrowed by the treasury before a single dollar is spent by congress the ami researchers contend all bank reserves are originally created by the fed for banks government expenditure merely transfers previous bank reserves back to banks as the federal reserve bank of st louis puts it federal deficits do not require that the federal reserve purchase more government securities therefore federal deficits per se need not lead to increases in bank reserves or the money supply what federal deficits do increase is the federal debt and while the debt itself can be rolled over from year to year as it virtually always is the exponentially growing interest tab is one of those mandatory budget items that taxpayers must pay predictions are that in the next decade interest alone could add 1 trillion to the annual bill an unsustainable tax burden to fund a project as massive as the green new deal we need a mechanism that involves neither raising taxes nor adding to the federal debt and such a mechanism is proposed in the u s green new deal itself a network of public banks while little discussed in the u s media that alternative is being debated in europe where green new deal proposals have been on the table since 2008 european economists have had more time to think these initiatives through and they are less hampered by labels like socialist and capitalist which have long been integrated into their multi party systems a decade of gestation in europe the first green new deal proposal was published in 2008 by the new economics foundation on behalf of the green new deal group in the u k the latest debate is between proponents of the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 led by former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis and french economist thomas piketty author of the best selling capital in the 21st century piketty recommends funding a european green new deal by raising taxes while varoufakis favors a system of public green banks varoufakis explains that europe needs a new source of investment money that does not involve higher taxes or government deficits for this purpose diem25 proposes an investment led recovery or new deal program to be financed via public bonds issued by europe s public investment banks e g the new investment vehicle foreshadowed in countries like britain the european investment bank and the european investment fund in the european union etc to ensure that these bonds do not lose their value the central banks would stand ready to buy them above a certain yield in summary diem25 is proposing a re calibrated real green investment version of quantitative easing that utilizes the central bank public development banks already have a successful track record in europe and their debts are not considered government debts they are financed not through taxes but by the borrowers when they repay the loans like other banks development banks are money making institutions that not only don t cost the government money but actually generate a profit for it diem25 collaborator stuart holland observes while piketty is concerned to highlight differences between his proposals and those for a green new deal the real difference between them is that his however well intentioned are a wish list for a new treaty a new institution and taxation of wealth and income a green new deal needs neither treaty revisions nor new institutions and would generate both income and direct and indirect taxation from a recovery of employment it is grounded in the precedent of the success of the bond funded roosevelt new deal which from 1933 to 1941 reduced unemployment from over a fifth to less than a tenth with an average annual fiscal deficit of only 3 percent roosevelt s new deal was largely funded through the reconstruction finance corporation rfc a public financial institution set up earlier by president hoover its funding source was the sale of bonds but proceeds from the loans repaid the bonds leaving the rfc with a net profit the rfc financed roads bridges dams post offices universities electrical power mortgages farms and much more and it funded all this while generating income for the government a system of public banks and green qe the u s green new deal envisions funding with a combination of the federal reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks which could include banks owned locally by cities and states as sylvia chi chair of the legislative committee of the california public banking alliance explains the green new deal relies on a network of public banks like a decentralized version of the rfc as part of the plan to help finance the contemplated public investments this approach has worked in germany where public banks have been integral in financing renewable energy installations and energy efficiency retrofits local or regional public banks chi says could help pay for the green new deal by making low interest loans for building and upgrading infrastructure deploying clean energy resources transforming our food and transportation systems to be more sustainable and accessible and other projects the federal government can help by for example capitalizing public banks setting environmental or social responsibility standards for loan programs or tying tax incentives to participating in public bank loans u k professor richard murphy adds another role for the central bank as the issuer of new money in the form of green infrastructure quantitative easing murphy who was a member of the original 2008 u k green new deal group explains all qe works by the buying debt issued by the government or other bodies using money that it quite literally creates out of thin air his money creation process is what happens every time a bank makes a loan all that is unusual is that we are suggesting that the funds created by the using this process be used to buy back debt that is due by the government in one of its many forms meaning that it is effectively canceled the invariable objection to that solution is that it would act as an inflationary force driving up prices but as argued in an earlier article of mine this need not be the case there is a chronic gap between debt and the money available to repay it that needs to be filled with new money every year to avoid a balance sheet recession as u k professor mary mellor formulates the problem in her book debt or democracy 2016 a major contradiction of tying money supply to debt is that the creators of the money always want more money back than they have issued debt based money must be continually repaid with interest as money is continually being repaid new debt must be being generated if the money supply is to be maintained this builds a growth dynamic into the money supply that would frustrate the aims of those who seek to achieve a more socially and ecologically sustainable economy in addition to interest says mellor there is the problem that bankers and other rich people generally do not return their profits to local economies unlike public banks which must use their profits for local needs the wealthy mostly hoard their money invest it in the speculative markets hide it in offshore tax havens or send it abroad to avoid the cyclical booms and busts that have routinely devastated the u s economy this missing money needs to be replaced and if the new money is used to pay down debt it will be extinguished along with the debt leaving the overall money supply and the inflation rate unchanged if too much money is added to the economy it can always be taxed back but as mmters note we are a long way from the full productive capacity that would overheat the economy today murphy writes of his green qe proposal the qe program that was put in place between 2009 and 2012 had just one central purpose which was to refinance the city of london and its banks what we are suggesting is a smaller programme to kickstart the uk economy by investing in all those things that we would wish our children to inherit whilst creating the opportunities for everyone in every city town village and hamlet in the uk to undertake meaningful and appropriately paid work a network of public banks including a central bank operated as a public utility could similarly fund a u s green new deal without raising taxes driving up the federal debt or inflating prices

the managed global slowdown which accelerated in the 4th quarter of 2018 was real and unfortunately much needed to manage global asset bubbles e g global equity bubbles and start the process of a

remains without immediate u s chinese and other global governments and central banks applying additional accommodative actions presently it appears the dollar will likely have near term weakness as a

president donald trump keeps changing his story in the swirling investigations into russia election interference and hush money payments to women who say they had affairs with him he insists that payments to porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 campaign were private transactions and that any crime committed would be the fault of his former personal attorney michael cohen not him that s a change from what the president said before trump previously had denied knowledge of payments and dismissed any hint of a crime in the special counsel s probe into contacts between russia and the trump campaign trump tried to cast doubt on whether his former national security adviser michael flynn had lied to the fbi flynn in fact pleaded guilty to doing just that over the past week trump also made a flurry of false or unsupported statements about immigration he said with no evidence that migrants are plagued with disease he asserted that mexico has in effect agreed to pay for his border wall even as he threatens a partial government shutdown if congress doesn t approve billions of dollars to build it he twisted federal statistics to claim the recent arrest of 10 terrorists who don t exist a look at the claims cohen trump remember michael cohen only became a rat after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started they broke into an attorney s office tweet sunday the facts it was not a break in the fbi executed a search warrant obtained from a judge in conducting the raid and seizing records on a variety of matters among them a 130 000 payment made to porn actress stormy daniels by trump s lawyer cohen the application for the warrant was approved high in the justice department former fbi director james comey tweeted in response sunday that trump is lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge trump i never directed him to do anything wrong whatever he did he did on his own interview thursday with fox news trump i never directed michael cohen to break the law many campaign finance lawyers have strongly stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance tweets thursday trump so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like obama s but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine lawyer s liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced tweets dec 10 the facts whatever the truth his account is evolving trump s description of the payments as a simple private transaction which he couples with his insistence that did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws is not how he explained it just a few months ago in april trump issued a blanket denial that he knew anything about reports of 130 000 in hush money paid to daniels saying reporters would have to ask michael cohen a month later he then acknowledged the payments as a private contract trump is now saying if something criminal happened it would be solely cohen s fault as his former attorney both cohen and american media inc the company that owns the national enquirer tabloid say they made hush money payments to daniels and mcdougal for the purpose of helping trump s 2016 white house bid a campaign finance violation both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies federal prosecutors say the payments were made at trump s direction for the payments themselves to be a crime rather than a civil infraction prosecutors would need to show that trump knew that what he was doing was wrong when he directed cohen to pay the women and that he did so with the goal of benefiting his campaign it s unclear what federal prosecutors in new york will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that trump himself committed a crime in the meantime trump s changing version of the truth is running head on into facts agreed to by prosecutors russia investigation trump wow 19 000 texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news witch hunt tweet saturday the facts the justice department s watchdog in a report released thursday found no evidence the fbi intentionally destroyed text messages of former fbi agent peter strzok and former fbi lawyer lisa page who were involved in the hillary clinton email investigation when they worked for the bureau the inspector general faulted an fbi wide software failure that has resulted in large portions of fbi text messages not being archived the report examined a gap in messages from december 2016 through may 2017 from the phones of strzok and page the fbi ultimately managed to recover thousands of the messages some congressional republicans had suggested the messages were intentionally deleted the inspector general report said there was no evidence strzok and page circumvented protocol strzok was removed from special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation after anti trump texts were discovered he has since been fired page resigned trump well the fbi said michael flynn a general and a great person they said he didn t lie and mueller said well maybe he did and now they re all having a big dispute so i think it s a great thing that the judge is looking into that situation it s an honor for a lot of terrific people remarks thursday the facts that s not what the fbi said and flynn trump s former national security adviser has agreed that he lied to the fbi he pleaded guilty to it and is to be sentenced this week the first white house official punished as part of special counsel robert mueller s ongoing russia investigation the idea that flynn didn t lie to the fbi picked up steam after republicans on the house intelligence committee issued a report this year that said ex fbi director james comey in a private briefing told lawmakers that agents who interviewed flynn discerned no physical indications of deception and saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them but comey called that description garble in a private interview with house lawmakers this month comey in essence said flynn was a good liar having a natural conversation with agents answered fully their questions didn t avoid that notwithstanding they concluded he was lying as for trump s comment that the judge is looking into the matter it s true u s district judge emmet sullivan has asked for documents related to the agents who interviewed flynn it s not clear from sullivan s order whether he considers there to be a dispute to resolve or if he just wants to see the underlying documents as he decides flynn s sentence border security trump the democrats policy of child seperation sic on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now remember the 2014 picture of children in cages the obama years tweet sunday the facts democratic president barack obama did not have a separation policy the trump administration didn t explicitly either but that was the effect of his zero tolerance policy which meant that anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted even those with few or no previous offences the policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings and their children were separated in most cases if the charge took longer than 72 hours to process which is the longest time that children can be held by customs and border protection children were sent into the care of the health and human services department zero tolerance remains in effect but trump signed an executive order june 20 that stopped separations trump also misrepresents 2014 photos of children in holding cells they did not involve family separation the photos taken by the associated press during the obama administration showed children who came to the border without their parents and were being housed at a customs and border protection center in nogales arizona the photos were identified as such but wrongly described online as illustrating imprisonment under trump trump people with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in and in many in many cases it s contagious they re pouring into our country we have to have border security statement in oval office meeting tuesday with democratic leaders rep nancy pelosi and sen chuck schumer the facts trump provided no evidence that people coming into the country including the caravan at the u s mexico border are carrying contagious diseases at a higher rate than the u s population medical screening is part of the process for vetting people who seek asylum a study published this month by the ucl lancet commission on migration and health called scares about contagion one of the most pervasive myths about migrants the study found no evidence that migrants pose a significant public health risk to countries such as the u s that have good health systems in fact migrants themselves face health threats from arduous journeys violence along the way or overcrowding in shelters or camps the lancet commission said while some may come from regions where certain diseases are common the report noted that international tourism and movement of animals spread illness too as for the caravan and other migrants from the south world bank statistics show mexico and central america vaccinate most children against measles sometimes at a bit higher rate than the u s along the border between mexico and california public health departments have long had a system in place to watch for signs of outbreaks of a variety of illnesses whether they re immigration related or not trump our southern border is now secure and will remain that way tweet tuesday trump we need border security people are pouring into our country including terrorists we have terrorists but we caught 10 terrorists these are over the last very short period of time 10 these are very serious people statement in oval office meeting the facts trump contradicted himself declaring the border secure and insecure on the same day and trump is wrong about the government recently catching 10 terrorists his statement is a mangling of federal statistics showing that u s customs and border protection stopped an average of seven to 10 people a day in the 2017 budget year who were denied entry to the u s because they were on a watch list that average applied to all points of entry and overwhelmingly from airports and was not specific to the southern border the standard for placing someone on the list is reasonable suspicion a lower bar than the probable cause needed to arrest someone for an alleged crime the statistics do not show how many might have been arrested or charged with anything in any event trump rendered a daily average as 10 recently captured terrorists in the flesh as for border security u s arrests on the mexican border jumped 78 percent in november from a year earlier to the highest level in trump s presidency increased arrests indicate that more people are trying to cross the border illegally jobs pelosi we came at a place to say how do we meet the needs of american people who have needs the economy has people are losing their jobs oval office meeting trump well we have the lowest unemployment that we ve had in 50 years oval office meeting the facts trump is correct about jobs there may always be some layoffs even if the economy is strong general motors for instance said last month it would cut as many as 14 000 workers in north america in a restructuring aimed at generating cash to spend on innovation even though u s auto sales are near historic highs but the u s economy has now added jobs for a record 98 straight months dating to october 2010 during the obama administration the labor department reported the unemployment rate in november stayed at 3 7 percent a five decade low for the third straight month the job gains are pushing down unemployment rates to historically low levels for a variety of groups the unemployment rate for men aged 20 and above fell last month to 3 3 percent the lowest in 18 years the rate for americans with just high school diplomas dropped to 3 5 percent the lowest since december 2000 the african american jobless rate declined to 5 9 percent matching may s figure as the lowest on record that s making it more challenging for businesses to find the workers they need employers have posted 7 million open jobs outnumbering the ranks of the unemployed which fell last month to just under 6 million the wall trump i often stated one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall this has never changed our new deal with mexico and canada the usmca is so much better than the old very costly anti usa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall tweet thursday the facts this is a face saving statement to mask the fact that mexico refused to pay for a u s border wall trump gave up trying to make it do so and u s taxpayers are on the hook for it in essence trump is arguing that new terms of trade with mexico will increase economic growth in the u s and produce more tax revenue that s what everyone hopes trade agreements will do as part of that he hopes for a lower trade deficit with mexico neither outcome is assured the deal negotiated with mexico and canada is an update of the north american free trade agreement he railed against not a transformative pact the three countries will continue trading in an environment of mainly low or no tariffs with improvements here and there for all three partners there is no credible way for trump to forecast additional growth covering costs that are being charged to u s taxpayers if the wall is built trade balances depend on too many factors consumer tastes exchange rates overall economic performance and the choices of thousands of companies among them and some are well outside any government s control trump specifically promised in the campaign that mexico would pay for the wall that is not the same as trying to reduce the u s trade deficit which is about the exchange of goods and services among private entities rather than payments between governments nor is a trade deficit necessarily a penalty on consumers it is the result of consumers buying things made in another country he wants some 25 billion from congress for wall construction over five years and promises a partial government shutdown if he does not get a 5 billion or so portion in the next week congress may or may not give him that if it does it will not be because lawmakers expect a refund to the treasury in future years from extra growth produced by a trade deal trump tremendous amounts of wall have already been built statement in meeting tuesday with pelosi and schumer trump people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built we have already built large new sections fully renovated others making them like new tweets the facts tremendous portions of the wall have not been built yes some barrier renovation has happened but little wall construction has been completed under trump congress allocated roughly 1 4 billion in the spring a bit more than 5 percent of what trump wanted for border security and specified that the money was not to be used for construction of the prototype wall sections that stand near san diego instead the money is to strengthen or replace existing fencing with more secure fencing altogether trump promised in the campaign that he d build a 1 000 mile 1 600 kilometer wall as high as 40 feet or 12 meters and have mexico pay for it which isn t happening if some 650 miles 1 050 km of existing fencing are considered in the equation that leaves him with about 350 miles 560 km of wall to build

by mises by george pickering as the economic contagion of the global financial crisis was spreading from country to country in 2007 it was frequently noted that the mainstream economics profession seemed to be just as much in the dark about the true causes of the crisis as were the general public in place of anything incisive and theoretically grounded most people were forced to make do with vague hand waving and metaphors to explain the crash with one particularly well worn bromide sticking out in my own memory as almost the defining phrase of the crisis when america sneezes the whole world gets sick however applicable that apophthegm may have been to the 2007 8 crisis it was certainly the phrase which came to mind recently when news broke that following the u s federal reserve s dovish turn last month central banks across the developing world have followed suit by shifting back toward lower interest rates an aggregate of interest rate moves across 37 developing economies showed that over the course of february the number of central banks in that group which had cut interest rates was greater by three than the number which had raised interest rates this compares with a net rate rise in january with one more central bank having raised rates than cut them in that group indeed this aggregate of 37 developing economies had not shown any net fall in interest rates throughout the previous nine months leading up to the end of january 2019 with interest rate hikes having either equaled or exceeded interest rate cuts for the duration of that period an easy money trend the trend began on 1st february just two days after fed chairman jerome powell announced that the case for raising rates has weakened when azerbaijan s central bank cut its refinancing rate by 50 basis points bringing it down to 9 25 this move was followed shortly afterwards by the reserve bank of india which unexpectedly cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on february 6th one of the biggest interest rate cuts of the month followed on the 14th with a surprise move by the egyptian central bank which cut its deposit rate to 15 75 and its lending rate to 16 75 a decline of 1 in both cases then on february 20th the bank of jamaica cut its key rate by 25 basis points down to 1 5 two days later the central bank of paraguay made a similar 25 basis point cut to its policy rate bringing it down to 5 and rounding out the month the national bank of the kyrgyz republic cut its own policy rate to 4 50 down from 4 75 on february 26th what has prompted this widespread shift toward looser monetary policy in the developing world while the rationales may differ from country to country in some of their specific details one prevailing theme has appeared time and again throughout the various justifications for these shifts toward lower rates fear of deflation after having strengthened consistently throughout most of 2018 the us dollar first stumbled and then noticeably fell between mid december and mid january and has largely been flatlining since as the equal and opposite reaction to this weakening of the dollar over the past few months the currencies of many of these developing economies have correspondingly strengthened in terms of dollars this has threatened to drop certain measures of inflation in those countries below their central banks inflation targets which in the mind of the mainstream economist brings with it the threat of unemployment and economic slowdown couple this with the various uncertainties and potential shocks currently manifesting on the global economic stage such as the chinese economic slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding brexit and you have a situation in which cutting interest rates would seem to be to the mainstream economist the textbook response after all what harm could possibly come from central bank inflationism and artificially low interest rates the price of low interest rates the advocates of austrian economics may find themselves increasingly occupied with the task of answering that question over the coming months after having maintained near zero interest rates for most of the past decade the past two years have seen the world s central banks gradually start the process of normalizing rates again in response to the sluggish recovery however as the austrian business cycle theory of ludwig von mises demonstrates that period of unsustainably low interest rates will not have been without costs such low interest rates will have induced investors into risky long term projects which will no longer maintain the illusion of profitability once rates rise back to their natural long term levels the relative upswing in the global economy over the past few years will be put under increasing pressure by the rising cost of borrowing pressure which it will likely not be able to withstand given the unsound foundation of unsustainably low interest rates on which that upswing has been built examining the movement of interest rates over the previous two business cycles in for example the united states seems to reveal a familiar pattern as the economy was recovering from the previous bust and entering the next boom the fed took this as its cue to raise interest rates back up to non crisis levels just as the austrian business cycle theory would lead us to expect however these rising rates shook the foundations of the unsustainable booms created by the previous periods of lower interest rates causing the economy to stutter the fed then reacted to this weakening of the boom by first halting and then reversing its interest rate rises with the recessions of 2001 and 2008 both having followed shortly after such reversals with central banks around the world currently signalling a likely softening of their previous plans for rate hikes it may well be that we have begun entering into the final stages of of this familiar cycle once again about the author george pickering is a

bridging the gulf since first elected to office five years ago state sen eric lesser has made economic development and more specifically closing the wide gap in prosperity between the eastern and western areas of the state his top priority while he s most closely linked to high speed rail he s put his name and energy behind a number of initiatives to bring more jobs and more vibrancy to the 413 as he talks about economic development in the bay state eric lesser focuses on most of the usual subjects jobs wages taxes incentives industry clusters training and technology but the issue he s really obsessed with is geography to be more specific it s the economic gulf that exists between east meaning greater boston and west in a state that s only 120 miles wide it s a huge gulf and since he was first elected to the state senate in 2014 lesser has devoted most of his waking hours to somehow closing it and enabling the four western counties to look and feel more like those east of worcester at least from a jobs and overall vibrancy perspective this broad goal has been the inspiration for dozens of bills and initiatives ranging from high speed rail service that would connect boston and springfield to more recent endeavors such as legislation that would pay 10 000 to individuals willing to move to western mass and work remotely and another bill that would funnel 87 million in incentives that general electric is essentially refunding to the state toward vocational education programs but in each case lesser told businesswest the bills were filed not to benefit western mass exclusively but the state as a whole said lesser chair of the legislature s manufacturing caucus and also its gateway cities caucus this challenge we have is actually a huge opportunity because we have a lot of assets we ve got great cultural institutions we ve got great academic institutions we re really close to red hot economic centers in new york to our south and boston to our east we have to take full advantage of this opportunity boston has an endless supply of fast growing high paying jobs he told businesswest what it doesn t have is enough open space enough affordable housing and a transportation system that can sustain all this so my philosophy for the past five years has been to work on policies that address the needs of both ends of the state as an example he cited the issue he is perhaps most closely associated with high speed rail service again the focus of ongoing study lesser said there is a good reason for his preoccupation with rail actually several of them indeed both research and recent events show there a strong relationship between rail service and seizing opportunities within the broad realm of economic development he said citing several once struggling cities within the commonwealth as examples the wall street journal did a detailed report on this about a year and a half ago he explained they looked at lowell lawrence worcester and springfield and determined that recovery from the great recession was greatest in those gateway cities that were connected by rail service why because they were able to take advantage of the overheating of the economy in boston people were moving out of the city to find more affordable places to live and they could do that because of the rail connection he went on rail will give people in western mass access to high paying jobs that will grow our economy by producing and fueling the construction industry among others and it gives eastern mass access to more open space and more affordable housing which are desperately needed priorities likewise the legislation involving incentives to move west would help this region because it would bring more young professionals with buying power to the area but it would also help the greater boston area by giving remote workers for companies based there a more affordable option for living in the bay state overall the energetic lesser is committed to helping this region not only regain some of the prominence it enjoyed when it was a center for precision manufacturing and had tens of thousands of people working in that sector at the springfield armory and several private companies but thrive in a modern technology driven economy fueled by innovation and entrepreneurship and as he goes about that assignment he sees a number of links between the past and the future indeed when one of the young entrepreneurs speaking at the state of entrepreneurship event staged last month at valley venture mentors opined that western mass could be the next silicon valley lesser when it was his turn to talk said this region was silicon valley not so long ago at least in terms of industrial innovation and firsts everything from the blanchard lathe to the monkey wrench due to a strong culture of entrepreneurship it is becoming that again but has a ways to go he told businesswest specifically when asked if this region could become home to many of the large corporations now based in and around boston the single biggest challenge is workforce he said companies need a a mix of workers and they need a supply of workers that can do what they need done we re not there yet overall to play a more prominent role in today s it driven economy this region needs some help in the broad and critical realm of connectivity he went on adding that this help could come in the form of a high speed rail connection funding to help vocational high schools reduce or eliminate their waiting lists for some programs and yes even incentives for individuals to relocate here this challenge we have is actually a huge opportunity he said because we have a lot of assets we ve got great cultural institutions we ve got great academic institutions we re really close to red hot economic centers in new york to our south and boston to our east we have to take full advantage of this opportunity for this issue businesswest talked at length with lesser about how his primary focus since being elected to office is doing just that state of the economy as he talked about the gulf that exists between east and west lesser whose district includes roughly half of springfield more than half of chicopee and several smaller towns east of springfield provided a quick history lesson in how things came to be this way in the 1980s we had a manufacturing oriented economy here that emptied out over the course of the 20 or 30 years since then he explained referencing the closing relocation or downsizing of stalwarts such as american bosch chapman valve westinghouse monsanto and others those companies used to employ thousands each and most of those still lie empty boston and eastern mass had the same phenomenon in fact the whole country saw it there were major manufacturing centers in the boston area that also emptied out the difference and the challenge we have is that in the boston area those jobs were replaced by jobs in high tech education healthcare the so called eds and meds as they say he went on we had some of the replacement in western mass but nowhere near as much or at the same rate as eastern mass and while jobs have left so too have people lesser noted that holyoke in its heyday as a paper and textiles mecca had a population of close to 60 000 today it s around 40 000 springfield once had 190 000 residents today the number is closer to 160 000 and while the populations are getting smaller they re also getting older and it s not just the urban centers they re talking about closing schools in communities all across my district in granby in wilbraham hampden even in longmeadow where they re talking about closing one of the two middle schools he told businesswest adding that these smaller aging populations are reaching a critical stage if we don t do big creative things to reverse this challenge that we face then we re going to be in big trouble he said emphasizing that adjective we ve got to bring in new ideas be aggressive about trying new concepts and work with what we have which is great people a great legacy of innovation and great quality of life and lesser has brought forth a number of new ideas since first elected many of them focused on replacing the jobs that have been lost in this region drawing more young people to the 413 and building the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the valley he wants to replace jobs lost by bolstering the region s already strong manufacturing sector with education and training programs aimed at retaining jobs and adding new ones and at the same time he wants to build a stronger workforce in this region one that will eventually attract more employers by making it easier to work for the companies in and around boston but live here which brings us back to high speed rail the matter has been studied but lesser fought hard for and eventually helped win funding to get it studied again he s confident that the study will reveal what he firmly believes that such rail service is a worthy investment for the commonwealth because of the benefits that will come from bringing greater boston and greater springfield closer together figuratively speaking rents are out of control in boston the traffic is asphyxiating they need relief from that and we offer that in western mass he explained adding quickly that he does not believe boston area prices will come to the 413 as they have in parts of rhode island and other regions of this state we re a long way from that being the challenge he said i m sensitive to that and we have to stay on top of that if you focus on things like transit oriented development clustering development around union station for example and redeveloping mill properties and vacant home units you can do this in a sustainable way that lifts all boats making progress as he referenced the region s proud history as an advanced manufacturing hub lesser said this sector remains one of its strengths however its status is threatened by a number of sustainability challenges especially when it comes to the workforce right now in the pioneer valley you have thousands of vacant positions in advanced manufacturing he noted and the reason they re vacant is because you have wait lists at all our voke schools they can t produce graduates fast enough to keep up with the growth this is a golden opportunity for us to grow the economy if we can target the state investments toward closing those voke ed and career and technical education waiting lists he went on referring to his legislation related to the ge incentives being refunded to the state you re going to get more people out the door into jobs working good jobs that pay 25 to 30 an hour entry level for an 18 or 19 year old with no college debt and if we don t do that how long is a company going to sit around with vacancies on their books they re going to move to north carolina texas eastern mass or upstate new york where they re going to find the workers thus the legislation regarding those ge incentives filed just last month is an example of that creative aggressive thinking that lesser mentioned earlier and an example of initiatives aimed at benefiting not just western mass but the state as a whole it s a measure that triggered a discussion about the prudence of granting large incentives for relocation to companies like ge when in lesser s opinion there are plenty of better ways to invest those tens of millions of dollars the idea behind that money was to create jobs referring to the more than 150 million awarded to ge as an incentive to move from connecticut to boston and invest in new facilities there but it was creating almost entirely high paying white collar jobs in an area of the state that is already producing a lot of high paying white collar jobs we desperately need middle class jobs in all the regions outside of boston which already has a red hot economy so the idea here is to direct the money to vocational and cte programs to do things like purchase more equipment outfit more classrooms and hire more teachers he went on you re going to reduce that backlog get students off the wait list and get them slotted right away into jobs with local employers that are already here he said the measure has garnered a considerable amount of support since it was filed and from across the state not surprising given the priority placed on training workers for the manufacturing sector by both the manufacturing caucus and the gateway cities caucus and efforts to get more cte funding such efforts have been going on for years and the momentum created by such efforts as well as changing views about granting incentives to large corporations that often don t bring all the jobs they promise or want too much in exchange for them may be prompting some rethinking when it comes to how this state might invest in economic development if we don t do big creative things to reverse this challenge that we face then we re going to be in big trouble we ve got to bring in new ideas be aggressive about trying new concepts and work with what we have which is great people a great legacy of innovation and great quality of life the state is willing to shell out with such enthusiasm a massive tax writeoff to a huge corporation that may or may not keep that money in massachusetts and in fact is more likely to distribute it to its shareholders who live all over the world lesser said now this becomes a test to see if the state is committed to middle class job creation outside of already hot markets how committed are we to creating jobs in springfield holyoke and pittsfield while awaiting an answer to that question lesser will also see if there is sufficient support for legislation that has come to be called his go west bill one that would award 10 000 to individuals willing to relocate to western mass and work remotely it was sparked he said by both the ongoing and accelerating trend toward professionals working remotely and also those alarming demographic trends cited earlier involving populations getting smaller and older instead he wants them to get larger and younger there s a big trend globally regarding remote working especially companies based in san francisco boston or new york he explained they re facing sky high commercial real estate prices so they re under immense pressure to shrink their office footprints in those cities so you can see a scenario where a bank based in new york wants to shrink its rent footprint in manhattan it can offer an incentive to its workers that can be matched with our incentive those workers can move here buy homes here send their kids to school here shop here and pay taxes here lesser enthusiastically points to an analysis of that bill authored by hans despain chair of the economics department at nichols college who praised lesser s focus on remote jobs especially those in the fire finance insurance and real estate sector and projected a benefit to the region of 60 000 for each individual who goes west the first thing to underscore is that this is quite literally a jobs bill despain wrote in an op ed in the republican for example for each new citizen who relocates to holyoke she brings with her a job that previously did not exist in the area connecting the dots when asked about whether energies should be put toward incentivizing the next ge if there is one to locate in the western part of the state or another still struggling region like the new bedford area lesser reiterated his contention that greater springfield simply couldn t contend for such a prize at this moment in its history for the very reasons that have prompted all those measures that have come off his desk we can t bring a ge here until we make the investments until we make the decisions we have to make that have quite frankly been kicked down the road far too long he told businesswest we need to invest in connectivity we need the rail service we need to continue to invest in our workforce and our local communities so we re producing the skilled workers who can work at those companies and i m very confident that a ge or an amazon could come here he went on but i m more interested in the kid at chicopee comp who thinks up the next ge and decides to locate it here and grow it here rather than packing up and moving it to boston or san francisco that can only happen if there s a workforce and if the gulf between east and west can be bridged these are the hard facts that drive lesser as he tries to engineer a solution to this long standing problem george o brien can be reached at
how michigan can fix the roads without tax hikes redirect revenue growth and corporate subsidies to roads eliminate optional grants and more gov gretchen whitmer has proposed increasing the state gas tax by 45 cents per gallon because she said there is not enough money in the current budget to fix the roads there are not many parts of our current tax code where you can make adjustments and raise that kind of revenue whitmer said at a recent roundtable hosted by mlive news but fiscal policy analysts at the mackinac center for public policy disagree they are working on a road funding solution that relies on projected growth in state revenue and shifting some priorities in the budget the result they say will provide more money for road repairs than the governor s tax increase can yield the mackinac center s list of recommendations is a work in progress according to fiscal analyst michael lafaive it could produce an extra 2 2 billion for road repairs with no tax increase he said which is more than the additional 1 9 billion whitmer wants to spend next year lafaive then described some of the proposals on the list the largest piece is redirecting to road repairs the 1 2 billion increase in state tax revenue that budget officials estimate will be collected next year thanks to a growing economy with no tax hike required other reforms and spending reductions the mackinac center has identified include defund corporate welfare in michigan every year the state spends hundreds of millions on a wide array of programs that transfer taxpayer dollars to a relatively small number of corporations and developers just one example is 75 million appropriated each year to the 21st century jobs fund a program that gives the money to or spends it on a variety of special interests total savings 244 1 million redirect money from the transportation economic development fund to repairs of highways known as trunk line roads this fund is another program that selectively benefits a handful of private interests one example was 500 000 spent in 2017 on redeveloping a 535 acre industrial complex in willow run so it could be turned into a self driving vehicle research hub that money and more could have been spent on fixing the state s highways total savings 43 3 million eliminate state arts grants among the recent grants was one for a garden poetry reading at a specialty farm in ann arbor total savings 9 0 million eliminate taxpayer support for the university of michigan s ann arbor campus u m would be a going concern without state taxpayer dollars it also had a 10 8 billion dollar endowment as of 2017 the eighth largest in the country according to u s news world report total savings 320 8 million reduce funding for a government preschool program called the great start readiness program initially meant for children of low income families great start has been expanded to subsidize preschool for households with higher incomes spending on it has more than doubled since 2011 after adjusting for inflation reverting the line item to the 2011 level and redirecting the program to its original purpose would save 131 7 million total savings 131 7 million end so called enhancement grant spending which is often added during midnight budget negotiations an example is that in the last two budgets 2 million was granted to the grand rapids civic theatre the money was appropriated without public discussion using a process that identifies the beneficiary only indirectly total savings 115 5 million end extra school district retirement payments school districts are responsible for paying the cost of state pensions earned by their employees to relieve districts of some of that burden the snyder administration shifted part of its cost to the state some of this responsibility and expense can be passed back to school districts total savings 100 million eliminate state funding for agbioresearch a program at michigan state university the appropriation for it finances research that often benefits the agribusiness industry which should pay its own way and some of the spending is of questionable value for example msu announced that its researchers had discovered the evolutionary origins of the cultivated strawberry total savings 34 6 million
the basic fact is that we have no long run budget policy no policy for the size of deficits and for the rate of growth of the public debt over a period of years annually we make decisions about the size of the deficit that are entirely inconsistent with our professed long run goals with the explanation and hope that something will happen or be done before the long run arises but not yet herbert stein aei economist dec 1984 the 35 day government shutdown that kicked off 2019 is only the latest indicator of the fiscal chaos that reigns in washington the chaos is reflected both in the failure of congress to follow the procedural rules it has set for itself and in a failure to provide a degree of fiscal stimulus or restraint that is appropriate to the state of the business cycle without better fiscal policy rules the chaos will continue procedural rules are not enough congress does have rules to guide fiscal policy the 1974 budget act specified a set of procedural rules that congress is supposed to follow each year in passing a budget however congress has passed the full set of appropriations bills on schedule only three times in the past 40 years even more problematic is the failure to align annual tax and spending decisions whether made on time or not with long run goals of stability and economic growth attempts to address that problem have proved inadequate consider the debt ceiling first enacted more than 100 years ago even if we could accurately determine the point beyond which debt becomes excessive the ceiling in its current form is unworkable since it is set in nominal terms with no allowance for inflation or growth of the economy congress must vote periodically to raise it that creates opportunities for various factions to disrupt the budgeting process with brinkmanship over extraneous issues even though everyone knows that the consequence of not raising the ceiling default on the debt would be so dire as to make the whole process a charade a more recent type of rule known as pay as you go or paygo has fared little better paygo has taken several forms since it was first established in 1990 but the underlying idea is to require that tax cuts or new spending be offset by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere in the budget in case the necessary offsets are not made sequestration mandatory cuts to already authorized programs can be invoked to prevent an increase in the deficit in practice however congress can and does waive paygo rules whenever it wants to for example it used a waiver to allow the 2017 tax cut to go into effect despite the resulting increase in the deficit long term rules for fiscal policy if procedural rules are not enough what would work better the answer is that if we want a more responsible fiscal policy we will need to rely less on the short term impulses of politicians and more on policy rules that target stable sustainable growth here are three suggestions rule 1 first do no harm the economic equivalent of this maxim is to aim for cyclical neutrality that is one that that manages taxes and spending in a way that avoids prolonging expansions or deepening recessions at first glance it might seem that the ideal neutral policy would be to keep the budget in balance at all times as would be required by that perennial favorite of congressional conservatives a balanced budget amendment in reality nothing could be worse as i explained in an earlier post a balanced budget amendment would be profoundly pro cyclical to keep the budget in absolute balance year in and year out would require tax increases or spending cuts during downturns and spending increases or tax cuts when the economy was at or above full employment that would be the exact opposite of do no harm in contrast a cyclically neutral rule would take full advantage of automatic stabilizers to moderate the business cycle one form of such a rule would be to hold the primary structural balance of the budget at a constant target value over time the primary structural balance differs from the ordinary way of measuring the federal deficit or surplus in two ways the structural part means that the actual surplus in any year is adjusted to reflect the levels of tax receipts and spending that would prevail under current law if the economy were at full employment during a recession the actual balance is below the structural balance that is further toward deficit because of low tax revenue and high spending on income transfers when the economy is running hot the actual balance is above the structural balance that is further toward surplus the primary part of the term means that interest payments on the national debt are disregarded although interest payments are a form of government outlay in the short run they are not under the control of policymakers instead for any given level of debt federal interest expenditures are largely determined by market interest rates the target for the primary structural balance could be set at zero at a small surplus or at a moderate deficit the choice depends in part on variables like the economy s long run rate of growth relative to market interest rates and also on whether policymakers want to hold total debt steady as a share of gdp to allow it to grow gradually or to decrease it for details of the math behind the choice of targets see this slideshow under conditions that currently prevail in the u s economy a zero primary structural balance or even a small deficit equal say to half a percent of gdp would be sufficient to achieve cyclical neutrality while ensuring that the debt ratio would gradually decrease do no harm of course is a pretty low bar in theory a rule that held the primary structural deficit at the desired level over the business cycle but allowed temporary countercyclical tax and spending measures on a discretionary basis would be even better however practical considerations of lags and forecasting errors not to mention political temptations to do the wrong thing at the wrong time provide grounds for caution the paygo waiver for the pro cyclical 2017 tax cut passed as the economy was well on its way to full employment is a case in point however there is one important exception to the no exceptions rule a do not harm rule should allow for extra fiscal stimulus beyond the amount needed to hold the primary structural balance constant during periods when interest rates fall to the zero bound rendering conventional monetary stimulus ineffective the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 would fit that specification see here and here for analysis of the arra and its effects rule 2 tax and spending reforms should be consistent with macro targets fiscal policy has both a macroeconomic and a microeconomic side rule 1 which calls for cyclical neutrality serves the macroeconomic goals of stability and growth microeconomic issues concerning the structure of taxes and the composition of spending are also important but they should be approached in a manner that does no macroeconomic harm in particular tax reform whether aimed at removing perverse incentives or improving distributional equity should be carried out in a way that is revenue neutral over the business cycle for example cuts in distortionary payroll or corporate profits taxes could be offset by increases in taxes thought to be less distortionary such as consumption or carbon taxes similarly spending increases even putatively growth enhancing ones such as infrastructure spending should be accompanied by cuts to lower priority spending programs or appropriate tax increases like its distant cousin paygo this rule would require congress to consider impacts on the deficit when passing tax or spending legislation however it differs from paygo in two important ways first it would be symmetrical in that it would not only bar inappropriate fiscal stimulus when the economy is near full employment but also inappropriate austerity during a recession or the early stages of a recovery second the degree of offset for tax cuts and spending increases would vary with the business cycle the required offset would be less than 100 percent near the bottom of the cycle and greater than 100 percent at or near the peak rule 3 fiscal rules should be neutral with respect to the size of government conservatives often propose that any fiscal rule should place a constraint on the overall size of government for example a 2011 version of a balanced budget amendment proposed capping federal expenditures at 18 percent of gdp such a constraint would be a mistake instead any rule governing the path of the deficit or surplus over the business cycle should be neutral as to the size of government as well as neutral with regard to the cycle itself in reality there is little evidence to support the idea that small government is necessarily good government on the contrary as i have discussed previously see here and here the available evidence shows a negative correlation between the size of government relative to gdp and broad measures of prosperity personal freedom and economic freedom overall quality of government as measured by such things as the rule of law protection of property rights and government integrity is more important for freedom and prosperity than the size of government yet even if one believes a smaller government is better such rules inject a contentious ideological motive into the debate over how best to reduce the debt level a rule that is neutral to government size leaves the question up to democratic debate with the proviso that new structural spending must be paid for the bottom line it is not likely that the white house or congress will agree anytime soon to putting fiscal policy on autopilot nor should they overly rigid rules would do more harm than good if strictly enforced as a balanced budget amendment would be or would invite so many waivers as to make them meaningless as in the case of debt ceilings and paygo yet between rules that are too rigid and no effective rules at all there is a golden mean those who are in charge of fiscal policy could learn a lot about the proper balance between rules and discretion by heeding the example of the fed for years there have been economists who have urged the fed to follow a more rules based policy and others who resisted those urgings speaking at a 2017 conference where both sides of the debate were thoroughly aired frederic mishkin a former member of the fed s board of governors argued that rules vs discretion is not an either or choice instead mishkin sees the fed as moving toward a regime of constrained discretion one that pays attention to rules but permits departures from the rules in response to unexpected economic shocks he argues that as long as such a regime is backed by transparent communication of policy goals and actions it can avoid the disadvantages both of pure discretion and of overly rigid rules in fact this statement on the board of governors website amounts to an assertion that constrained discretion is already the fed s official policy other countries such as sweden and chile have successfully applied constrained discretion to the management of government deficits and debts over the business cycle we could do so too if we could find the political will let s hope that it does not take another recession or self

asset reit inc funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations in thousands funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient management is responsible for managing interest rate hedge and foreign exchange risks to achieve our objectives we may borrow at fixed rates or variable rates in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on certain financial instruments if any we may enter into interest rate cap agreements or other hedge instruments and in order to mitigate our risk to foreign currency exposure if any we may enter into foreign currency hedges we view fair value adjustments of derivatives impairment charges and gains and losses from dispositions of assets as non recurring items or items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized and which are not reflective of ongoing operations and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance in order to provide a more complete understanding of the operating performance of a reit the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit promulgated a measure known as funds from operations ffo ffo is defined as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding extraordinary items as defined by gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating property adding back asset impairment write downs plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships joint ventures and preferred distributions because ffo calculations exclude such items as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains and losses from sales of operating real estate assets which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates they facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits as a result we believe that the use of ffo together with the required gaap presentations provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating financing and investing activities it should be noted however that other reits may not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do making comparisons less meaningful additionally we use adjusted funds from operations affo as a non gaap financial measure to evaluate our operating performance we previously used modified funds from operations mffo as defined by the institute for portfolio alternatives as a non gaap measure of operating performance management decided to replace the mffo measure with affo because affo provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analysis used by management in addition affo is a measure used among our peer group which includes publicly traded reits we also believe that affo is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the reit industry further we believe affo is useful in comparing the sustainability of our operating performance with the sustainability of the operating performance of other real estate companies management believes that affo is a beneficial indicator of our ongoing portfolio performance and ability to sustain our current distribution level more specifically affo isolates the financial results of our operations affo however is not considered an appropriate measure of historical earnings as it excludes certain significant costs that are otherwise included in reported earnings further since the measure is based on historical financial information affo for the period presented may not be indicative of future results or our future ability to pay our dividends by providing ffo and affo we present information that assists investors in aligning their analysis with management s analysis of long term operating activities as explained below management s evaluation of our operating performance excludes items considered in the calculation of affo based on the following economic considerations deferred rent most of our leases provide for periodic minimum rent payment increases throughout the term of the lease in accordance with gaap these periodic minimum rent payment increases during the term of a lease are recorded on a straight line basis and create deferred rent as deferred rent is a gaap non cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings ffo is adjusted for the effect of deferred rent to arrive at affo as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio amortization of in place lease valuation acquired in place leases are valued as above market or below market as of the date of acquisition based on the present value of the difference between a the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and b management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease for above market leases the above market and below market lease values are capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities and amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases as this item is a non cash adjustment and is included in historical earnings ffo is adjusted for the effect of the amortization of in place lease valuation to arrive at affo as a means of determining operating results of our portfolio acquisition related costs we were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring or investing in income producing real property in order to generate operational income and cash flow that will allow us to provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders in the process we incur non reimbursable affiliated and non affiliated acquisition related costs which in accordance with gaap are capitalized and included as part of the relative fair value when the property acquisition meets the definition of an asset acquisition or are expensed as incurred and are included in the determination of income loss from operations and net income loss for property acquisitions accounted for as a business combination by excluding acquisition related costs affo may not provide an accurate indicator of our operating performance during periods in which acquisitions are made however it can provide an indication of our on going ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern after we cease to acquire properties on a frequent and regular basis which can be compared to the affo of other non listed reits that have completed their acquisition activity and have similar operating characteristics to ours management believes that excluding these costs from affo provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance models and analyses used by management financed termination fee net of payments received we believe that a fee received from a tenant for terminating a lease is appropriately included as a component of rental revenue and therefore included in affo if however the termination fee is to be paid over time we believe the recognition of such termination fee into income should not be included in affo alternatively we believe that the periodic amount paid by the tenant in subsequent periods to satisfy the termination fee obligation should be included in affo gain or loss from the extinguishment of debt we use debt as a partial source of capital to acquire properties in our portfolio as a term of obtaining this debt we will pay financing costs to the respective lender financing costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discounts and amortized into interest expense on a straight line basis over the term of the debt we consider the amortization expense to be a component of operations if the debt was used to acquire properties from time to time we may cancel certain debt obligations and replace these canceled debt obligations with new debt at more favorable terms to us in doing so we are required to write off the remaining capitalized financing costs associated with the canceled debt which we consider to be a cost or loss on extinguishing such debt management believes that this loss is considered an event not associated with our operations and therefore deems this write off to be an exclusion from affo unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments these adjustments include unrealized gains losses from mark to market adjustments on interest rate swaps and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps not designated as a hedge and the change in the fair value of the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps are non cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense we have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of affo to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate swap agreements for all of these reasons we believe the non gaap measures of ffo and affo in addition to income loss from operations net income loss and cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap are helpful supplemental performance measures and useful to investors in evaluating the performance of our real estate portfolio however a material limitation associated with ffo and affo is that they are not indicative of our cash available to fund distributions since other uses of cash such as capital expenditures at our properties and principal payments of debt are not deducted when calculating ffo and affo the use of affo as a measure of long term operating performance on value is also limited if we do not continue to operate under our current business plan as noted above affo is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing our ongoing ability to generate cash flow from operations and continue as a going concern in future operating periods and in particular after the offering and acquisition stages are complete however ffo and affo are not useful measures in evaluating nav because impairments are taken into account in determining nav but not in determining ffo and affo therefore ffo and affo should not be viewed as a more prominent measure of performance than income loss from operations net income loss or to cash flows from operating activities and each should be reviewed in connection with gaap measurements neither the sec nareit nor any other applicable regulatory body has opined on the acceptability of the adjustments contemplated to adjust ffo in order to calculate affo and its use as a non gaap performance measure in the future the sec or nareit may decide to standardize the allowable exclusions across the reit industry and we may have to adjust the calculation and characterization of this non gaap measure our calculation of ffo and affo is presented in the following table for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 in thousands year ended december 31

this article is more than 5 years old forbes asia s chief economics commentator talks with thought leaders for their insights on the evolution of asia s economic order fan gang has a unique ringside seat to the rise of china in the last four decades through both his personal life and his professional career from being sent to the countryside by mao before he finished high school at the height of the cultural revolution to working on his ph d in economics at harvard university then to becoming a leading economist and influential policy advisor to the top chinese leadership his personal journey has been a microcosm of the extraordinary rise and transformation of china itself being able to speak with fan in private is like having a special window that opens to a view of the world that is deeply illuminating to gain some of his insights on what the global economic future may look like i caught up with him recently in singapore for dinner in the dolce vita restaurant in the mandarin oriental hotel fortuitously it turns out that italian food is fan s favorite cuisine apart from chinese food fan started by telling me how he became interested in economics sent to the countryside by mao in 1969 to learn from the peasants he was struck by the poverty and hardship of rural china which motivated him to learn and understand some of the most profound questions in economics what causes the difference between poverty and prosperity technological advances and backwardness economic development and stagnation on his own initiative he started an intense self education program even as he toiled daily in the fields by 1978 mao was dead and the madness of the cultural revolution was finally over fan and his fellow students were allowed to return to beijing to study in the university his years of self education paid off as fan was able to go straight to university making up for his lost years he gained entrance to hebei university and majored in economics one of only a handful of students studying the subject at that time in the aftermath of the cultural revolution the standards of china s post secondary education were extremely poor deng xiaoping knew how dire the situation was and he actively sought assistance from the west including the u s when fan started his ph d studies in economics in the chinese academy of social sciences the partner institution was none other than harvard university from 1985 to 87 fan found himself studying at harvard learning from some of the best minds in the world after completing his ph d from harvard he returned to china and joined the faculty of the chinese academy of social sciences in 1988 and started immediately contributing to the policy debate and advocated opening and modernizing the economy in a short span of time fan established himself as a leading economist through the economic policy papers he wrote in the academe three years after joining the faculty he became the youngest full professor at the chinese academy of social sciences this was followed by an appointment to the influential monetary policy committee of the people s bank of china he has since been re appointed three times in addition to being an increasingly valued advisor to the government he was also sought after by foreign and domestic businesses for his insights on the chinese economy leading global companies such as barclays rolls royce ace and mastercard engaged him as their advisor leading multilateral institutions like the world bank imf oecd undp and adb also started to seek him out for advice and inputs soon international recognition and accolades started to arrive he was invited to teach as visiting scholar in some of the top universities in europe and north america he received honorary doctorate degrees from france and canada and he was named one of the world s top 100 public intellectuals in 2005 and again in 2008 by foreign policy and prospects and in 2010 was named one of 100 top global thinkers by foreign policy in 2006 he was appointed president of the china development institute one of the most prestigious government economics think tanks tasked with a direct advisory role to the top leadership fan s policy work on reforming and advancing the chinese economy is much in the mode of deng xiaoping s crossing the river by feeling the stones practical non doctrinaire and open minded more critically fan does not see china s economic reform simply as a linear progression from socialist central planning to free market as it is often portrayed instead he believes that china has to work out what is appropriate for itself at each stage of its economic development under certain conditions solutions to china s economic challenges may actually require the combined strength of both the public and the private sector counter intuitively the private sector could also gain from having a strong public sector there is no simple one size fits all formula for tackling a task as complex and massive as the modernization of china i asked fan for his views on the current trade war between the u s and china characteristically he started with the broad historical context he reminisced about a shopping experience in boston in the mid 80s when he was studying at harvard after an exhaustive search in a big department store he found just one single item a hand woven wicket basket that carried the label made in china three decades later and china had become the second largest economy in the world and found itself embroiled in a trade war with the number one the u s it is the speed of china s rise that is a key reason for the unpreparedness of both china and the u s and for that matter the rest of the world in managing the disruptions caused by the rise of china in the global economic order china today is typically seen as a major economic power and is expected to conform to international norms that are based on western institutions reflecting contemporary western values while its economy is big in the aggregate china is nowhere close to being a developed country in rough terms the u k reached china s current per capita income over a century ago at that time the u k was able to make all the rules and no one was there to impose international sanctions against it for its behavior no matter how outrageous it was by today s standards when the british empire grew its military invaded other countries violently suppressed native uprisings prised open foreign markets with the gunboats of the royal navy and expanded its imperial possessions in contrast to today how china conducts its economic reform how it manages its currency how it invests overseas are constantly scrutinized and judged against norms and standards set by western countries even though china s per capita gdp is still only a fraction of theirs fan believes that the playing field in the global economy is stacked against today s successful emerging markets they are expected to conform to standards that have been created by western countries at levels of development and income many multiples higher than the emerging markets china with a gdp per capita of around 10 000 is expected to behave exactly like countries with gdp per capita six to eight times higher notwithstanding all of the hype about the rise of china as far as fan is concerned china will continue to be a developing country for a few decades at least fan does not believe that china can change the global economic order unilaterally from this point of view fan is firmly a multilateralist but he believes that emerging markets can and should collectively exert their influence to ensure that they can manage their economic development in a way that is most suitable to their specific circumstances and to serve their societies interests consistent with their own values for this to happen the developed countries of the west who created and continue to dominate international institutions in the global economic order will need to allow emerging markets more room to experiment and progress for example fan points out that prior to the global financial crisis western political leaders scholars and experts came to china and preached the merits of market deregulation and privatization of the state sector after the global financial crisis they are still preaching but what they preach has changed now the same pundits are preaching the need of reducing inequality and singing the virtue of inclusive growth to china with the same conviction and certainty as before as it happens fan agrees with many of their arguments but he firmly believes that emerging markets need to evolve their own development pathways the worst possible course of action is for emerging markets to adopt wholesale the standard prescriptions of market reforms and political liberalization from the west the result is typically economic stagnation and political chaos with the occasional financial crisis and he points to the chronic failures in economic development in some of the latin american countries as a consequence of such policy mistakes in contrast fan suggests that the successful rapid industrialization and economic development of east and southeast asia has been achieved through pragmatic policies that combine flexible market reforms with strong state control over the pace and scope of economic opening east asia tapped into the global market through selective liberalization notably in labor intensive manufacturing in the early phase of their economic takeoffs infant industries were protected when it was considered necessary and many sectors especially in finance remained tightly regulated for much longer the government also played a major role in investing in public infrastructure without which the private sector would not be able to compete in the global market many mistakes were undoubtedly made notably the 1997 asian financial crisis but east asia was able to respond effectively and recovered in a way east asia pioneered the practice of cross the river by feeling the stones long before deng formulated it into one of his most famous aphorisms china is of course the most current and the largest example of the east asian success story but is china the last country to get on the bus of rapid industrialization and development through labor intensive and export oriented manufacturing fan sees today dark clouds gathering on the horizon technology may be eroding the power of manufacturing in driving rapid industrialization it could become a thing of the past as robotics and artificial intelligence become more capable and cost effective in replacing workers this could mean the closing of this well trodden path of rapid industrialization for developing countries especially in africa at the same time the developed countries of the west are becoming less tolerant to chronic trade deficits with emerging markets responding to the rise of nativist nationalism many western countries are trying to tighten the rules of the wto to eliminate exemptions previously available to low income developing countries furthermore the demand from many western human rights ngos that developing countries should abide by the same labor standards in the west would effectively wipe out their comparative advantages which is equivalent to erecting trade protectionism under the guise of human rights even if it means plunging tens of millions of workers in low income countries into unemployment these are all ominous developments that is why fan believes that emerging markets must find a way to exert their influence in the global economic order this is not a task for china to undertake alone but china can play an important role especially in stepping up in the provision of public goods in international development the belt and road initiative bri is one such initiative fan believes that in spite of some pushback the bri remains spot on in addressing the deep infrastructure deficits in many developing countries in the vast geographic corridor stretching from asia across the middle east to africa while the bri was initiated by china it is now a global enterprise that is led by asia with participating countries from europe and africa giving both substance and voice to asia s aspiration to offer an alternative approach to the market liberalization orthodoxy of the west in this connection fan hopes that china can play a leading role among emerging markets in defining and defending their interests within the multilateral global system finally fan sees that the path of pragmatic evolution being equally applicable to political development he is unimpressed by the kind of democracy commonly seen in developing countries when democracy is artificially grafted onto a society still shackled with pervasive poverty typically it is the form of democracy that is adopted not the substance the result is electoral democracy amounting to nothing more than the ritual of regular elections but in between elections the society suffers from dysfunctional governments ineffective corrupt and predatory public institutions poor governance absence of law and order and deteriorating infrastructure fan has seen first hand this type of electoral democracy in many developing countries where electoral democracy could jeopardize a country s development instead of being a driver of economic growth fan s hope is that china can share its development experiences in a positive way in spite of its popularity in some quarters fan does not believe that there is a china model that can be mechanically replicated by other developing countries however some meaningful lessons can be learned in china s development success they suggest a need for thoughtful pragmatism in market reforms strengthening of public institutions gradual introduction of the rule of law and sustained investment in infrastructure health care and education when implemented in an open ended and disciplined approach guided by experimentations it could pay rich dividends for fan these lessons learned could be china s contributions to a new global economic order that can accommodate priorities and needs of both the developed and developing countries
by bryan dyne and barry grey 5 march 2019 last month new york representative alexandria ocasio cortez a member of the democratic socialists of america and massachusetts senator ed markey both democrats introduced a non binding resolution in both houses of congress calling for a green new deal to transition american energy production to non carbon based sources within 10 years it is currently co sponsored by 89 out of 235 democrats in the house of representatives and 11 out 47 in the senate alongside calls for the federal government to take action to halt and reverse climate change and other ongoing ecological threats the document proposes a federal mobilization comparable to the new deal of the 1930s which created the greatest middle class the united states has ever seen it sees the present situation as an historic opportunity to secure for all people in the country the following clean air and water healthy food a sustainable environment high quality health care affordable safe and adequate housing economic security and a job with a family sustaining wage adequate family and medical leave paid vacations and retirement security the attempt to even raise such social and economic issues has provoked a backlash from politicians within both big business parties virtually the entire republican party has denounced it and republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has scheduled a vote in the senate to force democrats to publicly align with or dissociate themselves from the bill the leader of the democrats in congress speaker of the house nancy pelosi has derisively referred to the resolution as a green dream senate minority leader charles schumer has indicated the democrats will vote present so as to evade the issue when it comes up for a vote many democratic supporters and co sponsors of the green new deal have since backtracked calling the proposal merely aspirational in the words of co sponsor and democratic presidential hopeful senator amy klobuchar it is at best something that we need to move toward in other words they have no intention of actually implementing it to be clear it is a fiction that this proposal even if it were adopted unanimously by both houses of congress would have any real impact on us domestic or foreign policy its non binding status means that no lawmaker will in any way be beholden to working toward the resolution s stated goals gabriel zucman recently wrote what the data show is that wealth concentration in the united states has returned to the level of 1920 forty percent of total household wealth belongs to the top 1 percent about 20 percent belongs to the top 0 1 percent which is about the same as the bottom 90 percent s wealth share the sweeping nature of the resolution however has generated understandable popular interest and support among workers and youth the green new deal proposes to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions to create millions of good high wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people and to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the united states ocasio cortez has raised some of the chief concerns of the bottom 90 percent of the income ladder in america who comprise the working class they face a daily struggle to survive and provide for their families while the richest 10 percent and especially the top 1 percent 0 1 percent and 0 01 percent monopolize an ever greater share of income and wealth it is all the more critical therefore to clarify the political character and historical context of the green new deal its basic although unstated premises are 1 that global warming can be halted and reversed on a national basis 2 that the democratic party can be made to carry out such a program and 3 that it can be achieved within the framework of the existing economic and political system nationalism and the climate crisis it is an established scientific fact that human induced climate change has already cost billions of dollars and caused thousands of deaths and is poised to inflict exponentially greater social misery if it is not immediately abated and reversed repeated studies have shown that it will require the coordination of the most advanced scientific and technical resources the world over in order to even begin to seriously reduce global warming such measures would require an international reorganization of the world s energy industry the green new deal resolution however neither calls for the cooperation of the nations of the world nor places any limits on the activities of the energy corporations quite the opposite it insists on making the united states the international leader on climate action by calling for investments to spur economic development deepen and diversify industry and business in local and regional economies these investments would be allocated by means of community grants public banks and other public financing in other words more public funds will be handed over to the us energy monopolies and other corporate interests the same institutions that are responsible for climate change in the first place any measures ostensibly aimed at reducing climate change will have to be acceptable to corporations and banks and their wealthy shareholders far from advancing an internationalist perspective the green new deal resolution has a distinctly nationalist axis it makes an unambiguous appeal to the national security agencies of the american state first by citing as a model the federal government led mobilizations during world war ii and second by arguing that climate change constitutes a direct threat to the national security of the united states by impacting the economic environmental and social stability of countries and communities around the world and acting as a threat multiplier the not so subtle suggestion here is that the adoption of the green new deal is an essential component of us imperialism s preparations for war against its rivals for world domination and necessary for the stability of us capitalism it should not be forgotten that the government led mobilization during world war ii included the mass incarceration of japanese americans and ended with the nuclear incineration of hiroshima and nagasaki national security a euphemism for the continued rule of the capitalist class and the pursuit of its global profit interests is incompatible with any serious mobilization of resources to meet the social needs of working people including a healthful and life sustaining environment numerous national security think tank studies have stressed the need to drastically reduce so called entitlement spending i e funding for social security and medicare as well as spending for other social programs in order to carry out the military expansion and modernization necessary to prepare for war against the major rivals of american imperialism in the first instance russia and china the democratic party then there is the question of the democratic party the notion that this party can serve as the vehicle for a serious effort to reverse climate change or any other progressive social reform is belied by its history and the social interests that control it historically the democratic party has served as the graveyard of progressive movements from the populist movement at the turn of the 20th century to the industrial union movement of the 1930s to the civil rights movement and anti war movement of the post world war ii period mass movements for progressive social change have been contained dissipated and betrayed by means of their subordination to this the oldest capitalist party in the us no significant social reforms have been enacted in the us in more than 50 years the democrats long ago abandoned any program of social reform or any policies oriented to the social interests of the working class over the past half century the democratic party has moved steadily and with increasing velocity to the right seeking and largely succeeding in dislodging the republicans as the favored party of wall street and the military intelligence apparatus on the basis of racial gender and sexual politics designed to deny the central class division of modern society it has oriented itself to the super rich and the most privileged layers of the middle class in the last presidential election hillary clinton won a majority of votes in affluent middle class suburbs and among the richest layers of the population democratic no less than republican administrations have imposed austerity policies and prosecuted the decades long social counterrevolution that continues today obama whose election was hailed by the international socialist organization one of the promoters of bernie sanders and ocasio cortez today as a transformational moment in american history presided over the multi trillion dollar bailout of wall street the imposition of wage cuts on auto workers and mass school closures and the greatest redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top in us history under obama labor s share of the national income hit record lows and he boasted of reducing non defense non entitlement domestic spending to the lowest levels since the eisenhower years in the 1950s the talk of a new new deal that attended his election proved to be a cruel deception it is difficult to say which of the two major big business parties is more reactionary the democrats are basing their opposition to trump on demands for a more aggressive policy toward russia and an escalation of war in the middle east while supporting his raising of the pentagon budget to near record levels in every struggle of the working class they work in lockstep with the republicans to deny the workers demands including the strikes by teachers for decent pay and the defense of public education claiming there is no money for decent schools while they accelerate the privatization of the education system at the same time they glorify the cia fbi and the military and lead the campaign to censor the internet and suppress oppositional views their primary domestic focus is the right wing metoo sex witch hunt based on the denial of due process and the presumption of innocence and the promotion of racial politics to divide the working class the references to the new deal by ocasio cortez and other promoters of the green new deal are grossly misleading they rip this period of limited social reform out of its historical context and distort both its origins and its results the new deal was the response of a frightened ruling class to the threat of social revolution heightened by two factors the global breakdown of capitalism in the great depression of the 1930s and the revolutionary impulse provided by the russian revolution and the existence of the soviet union roosevelt s reforms were not granted from on high by a benevolent ruling elite they were extracted from a ruthless capitalist class by a semi insurrectionary movement of the working class in the form of a mass industrial union movement that was largely led by socialist minded workers it came at a time when american capitalism was the rising and dominant industrial power in the world and the ruling class had massive economic reserves even in the midst of the depression even then the reforms instituted never came close to overcoming economic inequality or securing the basic needs of the working class the trade unions formed or consolidated out of the wave of sit down strikes quickly made their peace with capitalism signed on to the post war cold war and anti socialist witch hunt and in the ensuing decades became junior partners with the corporations in imposing wage cuts layoffs and the destruction of working conditions this process was institutionalized through their alliance with the democratic party for the past 40 years american capitalism has been in precipitous decline it long ago dismantled much of its industrial base in order to become the world s leader in financial parasitism and criminality over this entire period every social reform from the 1930s and 1960s has been under relentless attack as part of a social counterrevolution presided over by both parties against the working class making the us the most unequal country of all the major economies donald trump is the fascistic personification of the financial oligarchy and the noxious expression of the protracted decay of american democracy where do the democrats get their money in last year s mid term elections the securities and investment industry gave 62 percent of its contributions to democrats continuing the trend from 2016 when wall street gave far more money to hillary clinton than to donald trump the oil and gas industry which has long given the bulk of its campaign bribes to republicans nevertheless handed out 6 million to democratic candidates in 2018 house speaker nancy pelosi is worth an estimated 16 million and has high end wall street connections via her husband s firm financial leasing services she led the successful 2015 campaign to end a forty year ban on crude oil exports opening up the world market to us companies for his part senate minority leader charles schumer known as the senator from wall street has received 310 020 from the oil and gas industry throughout his political career social inequality and capitalism the entire social structure of the united states and therefore its political system is anchored in the vast concentration of wealth at the very top speaking of a return to gilded age levels of inequality the economist gabriel zucman recently wrote what the data show is that wealth concentration in the united states has returned to the level of 1920 forty percent of total household wealth belongs to the top 1 percent about 20 percent belongs to the top 0 1 percent which is about the same as the bottom 90 percent s wealth share this is part of an international process earlier this year the british charity oxfam reported that in 2018 just 26 people controlled as much wealth as the 3 8 billion people who comprise the bottom half of the world s population no genuine social reform can be enacted today outside of a direct assault on social inequality and the entrenched wealth and power of the corporate financial oligarchy that includes the political parties it controls the other basic obstacle to resolving the climate crisis and all of the other social ills that plague humankind is the division of the increasingly integrated world economy between rival nation states which are the political forms through which the competing national cliques of capitalists fight for control of the world s resources markets and sources of cheap labor climate change is a global problem and can be solved only through the systematic and intelligent mobilization of the resources and scientific and technological know how of the entire planet the green new deal is not a program to address the urgent social needs of working people in the us it is a hollow slogan and grab bag of demands meant to divert the growing struggle of the working class into the dead end of the democratic party the solution to climate change along with social inequality poverty and the growing threat of dictatorship and war is the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system both in the us and internationally the financial oligarchs must be expropriated and their corporations and banks turned into public utilities under the democratic control of the working population the social force capable of carrying out such a transformation is the working class it must be mobilized and armed with a revolutionary socialist program to take political power and establish a workers state as part of the world socialist revolution
xinhua updated 2019 03 19 09 27 china s bond market has a particular role to play in the country s greater financial integration into the global economy washington china s bond market already the third largest in the world has a particular role to play in the country s greater financial integration into the global economy an international monetary fund imf official has said last year china celebrated its 40th anniversary of reform and opening up which contributed to china s trade and product integration said alfred schipke the imf senior resident representative for china but if you re looking at the future our view is that the future will be about china s financial sector integration with the world and the bond market will play a particular role schipke told xinhua in a recent interview starting next month china will be included in the bloomberg barclays global bond index and that s a milestone for china s financial sector integration globally he noted bonds issued by the chinese government and policy banks will be included in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate bond index beginning in april with a 20 month phase in period bloomberg confirmed in late january after their full inclusion yuan denominated bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the dollar the euro and the japanese yen it will effectively lead to more purchases of chinese bonds by foreigners and provide investors globally with an opportunity to diversify their assets schipke said it also requires that policymakers and investors both in china and abroad have a better understanding of the structure of china s bond market and its unique characteristics he added china s bond market stood at about 86 trillion yuan 12 84 trillion by the end of 2018 with about 1 8 trillion yuan held by global investors up 46 percent year on year showed china s official data schipke noted that the inclusion of the rmb in the imf s special drawing rights sdr basket in 2016 was associated with operational improvements in china s bond market which has triggered a surge in global investor interest more foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds have bought rmb bonds as part of their reserves he said as holdings of rmb reserves by foreign central banks have gone up about 100 percent since 2016 citing the co movement of the rmb with other currencies in the world schipke said the international monetary system might be moving away from the bipolar us dollar and the euro blocs to a tripolar system that probably means that there will be additional demand for rmb bonds he said the belt and road initiative bri is also likely to boost transactions in the country s bond markets according to the imf official there has been a pickup in demand of issuing rmb bonds in both china s offshore markets and onshore markets to finance bri projects schipke said expecting that to continue to go forward in his opinion the further development of china s bond market will be linked to the successful implementation of supporting reforms and strengthening policy frameworks including improving corporate governance and fostering communication because investors are individuals that make decisions based on information the better the government communicates about its policies it reduces volatility he said

his third term as commissioner said he questioned whether running again was the right choice i asked myself who s going to fight harder for the working class men and women who better understands the needs and concerns of our people he said my answer was this no one will do better than i will mckernan seeking a second term spoke of his passion for the 40 to 60 hour work weeks that comes with the job i love the job i enjoy it he said we re out there we re listening to people trying to get things done bower spoke of his achievements as a loyalsock township supervisor for the past 12 years including completing a multi million sewer project well under budget when i first got on the board it was approximately 22 million and over the next seven years we finished it for approximately 13 million he said the first question asked was whether the candidates identify as pro life if so are they 100 percent pro life or are there exceptions each candidate responded they are fully pro life except nassberg who said as the only candidate here who s carried a baby to term and also miscarried i understand i believe in the sanctity of life that said it s not under the jurisdiction of the county and there s nothing i can do about it therefore i would rather spend my time talking about what i can do this is a social issue not a political one next the candidates were asked for their proposals to keep taxes at their current rate over the next four years campana and riley agreed the county needs to attract new businesses and help current businesses expand campana added that county government needs to shrink cut cut cut cut and keep cutting nassberg said metzger opposed nassberg saying measure twice cut once addressing problems such as decreasing population increasing poverty and excess county owned real estate are the way to go metzger said mussare noted actions taken during his terms such as decreasing annual raises for employees and switching to health insurance plans that force staff to pay in mckernan hinted the county planning department will switch its focus to economic development with the goal of attracting new businesses the county is decreasing staff positions and preparing to sell off excess real estate he added bower said the budget needs to be analyzed line by line and department head positions need reviewed he added loyalsock township hasn t had a tax increase in 12 years believing that government has no place in the private sector the candidates next were asked how they feel about the county owning a golf course and excess real estate bower said he wants to explore the possibility of selling the golf course the county farm is a good attribute but other excess property has to be analyzed on a case by case basis he said billy casper golf has reduced the golf course s loss annually and expects to profit this year mckernan said the county is considering selling nine holes on excess real estate you will see something go for sale this year downtown he said mussare added this is the first year lycoming county tax dollars won t subsidize the golf course then echoed mckernan stating property will be up for sale this year the county owes 3 5 million by 2027 on the golf course metzger said that money can t be made by selling the course on excess property the county has paid 4 5 million to lease the sharwell building where lycoming children and youth services is housed for nine years when it owns other properties that could house that organization metzger said riley agreed with metzger stating selling the golf course won t pay it off and leasing the sharwell building is insane considering other properties sitting empty nassberg said she was surprised that 72 cents per dollar collected in revenue go toward administration for the golf course find out what it should cost to run a golf course then see if it s feasible here she said prior plans for excess real estate were not followed which resulted in leasing the sharwell building she added personally i don t believe that government should be in the real estate business campana said when government sells property the private sector buys it makes the investment and pays taxes finally the candidates were asked their beliefs on the idea of building a new prison or expanding the pre release center campana said he is a numbers guy who will look into the cost but won t approve something that will increase county debt nassberg said she would consider a regional approach to decrease costs for certain prison services building a new prison is an absolutely insane proposal right now riley said put more money toward prevention efforts that keep people off the path of crime in the first place he said a regional approach won t work lycoming county already has tried it metzger said instead focus on programs that reduce the prison population such as the reentry program mussare said the county spends well over 1 4 million to house prisoners out of county the female population especially is tricky with 13 women currently out of county he said we need to continue diversionary tactics he said mckernan agreed adding the prison has joined a u s marshal program that allows it to house male federal inmates and generate some revenue to make up for the out of county costs mental health efforts in the prison may also help reduce costs he added i think we need to look at all avenues to regionalize and work with nearby counties bower said

when adjusted it translates in a deeper 71 discount on adjusted nav and an implied capitalization rate of 23 given the quality of the assets it seems to be quite underpriced on the other hand the discount does not explicitly appear when valuing the company with classic p e or p fcf multiples as one of the main assets is generating little earnings this may be one of the sources of mispricing potential short term catalyst management has been delaying the sale of macao assets with the objective to capitalize on the potential boost of the local economy due to the recent opening of the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge and other developments one potential catalyst is the sale of those assets that alone would represent about hk 6 4 per share low risk level wide margin of safety and low debt even if the company operates partially in a cyclical industry hotels real estate and is often affected by the ups and downs of the gaming industry the current valuation does not seem justified furthermore the company has no net debt a most probable risk is that the market takes some time to correctly value the company ownership management the â hoâ family possesses about 74 of the company

commercial and residential properties in macao and several hotels abroad usa vietnam japan canada ksi is a small cap 1 7bn hk â 210m usd listed in the hong kong stock exchange the company is highly illiquid daily average 20 100k usd and it seems not to be covered by sell side analysts the company has traded most of the time at discount to book value applying a certain discount on holding companies is quite common however in this case the difference is significant and getting wider the gap between market price and net asset value may be reduced in the medium term due to i the potential catalyst of selling the ocean garden properties ii accumulation of cash from operations ksi has shown a track record of value creation for the shareholders compounding book value steadily although slowly for the past years 6 cagr from 3 7 in 2000 to 10 9 in 2018 and achieving double digit returns on capital in the past decade except in 2014 when sofitel ny was acquired source author based on company data the company has also steadily increased revenues and ebit as well as fcf 13 8 cagr 2008 2017 generating in the last decade about hk 1 5bn close to the current market cap of 1 7bn and in the past years about hk 200 250m in fcf to shareholders annually this is one of the â slowâ catalysts until the company decides to divest the held for sale hfs properties it is expected that ksi will continue to generate this level of cash and this is what the market may be discounting with current valuation 8x fcf 2018e in terms of financial leverage the company has been quite conservative holding a net cash position most of the time this is quite rare in real estate companies most of which tend to be highly levered top line overview source author based on company data hotel segment represents today 95 of revenue share and more than half comes from room related services slot machine revenues represent an important part c 20 of hotel revenues despite coming only from vietnam hotel segment proceeds from sales of properties mainly in macao are today a residual segment but it is important to note that ksi has evolved from a sell strategy towards a hold strategy representing 50 of the total revenues in the early 2000s vs only 1 in 2017 although the company does not explicitly report why this strategic movement capitalizing on macao property appreciation is an intentional decision from management on the other hand rental income representing c 5 is one of the key segments to understand the mispricing of the stock in 2017 ksi generated hk 90m in rental income being hk 59m from the held for sale hfs properties operations as we will see later on this report these assets mainly ocean garden apartments are rented at a very low implied yield c 2 although they are quite valuable if were sold what according to management is their ultimate purpose these are the same properties that ksi has carried at cost in the balance sheet from the past decade management ownership

observation of the balance sheet and performing a sum of the parts we go through the main assets and finally we will calculate the adjusted net asset value nav subtracting all liabilities in terms of nav we estimate the value of the company at about hk 19 per share vs current price of hk 5 70 nav calculation will be based on the most important property segments usa two 4 star hotels w san

several others another fully owned hotel in osaka japan minority stakes in several other hotels canada china europe and miscellaneous properties in macao and singapore all these properties will not be presented in detail as they are much less relevant for the investment thesis companies trading with such wide discounts on book value or even wider discounts on nav are usually companies that have low quality assets or high levels of debt in this case net debt is inexistent and as we go through each of the assets and their individual valuations we will see that the company owns some very high quality assets 1 usa hotels w san francisco and sofitel new york w san francisco soma picture from booking com sofitel new york manhattan picture from booking com w san francisco sofitel new york

good performance and high ranges for adrs 332 354 usd and revpar 275 304 usd as well as having strong occupancies 82 7 86 0 both markets are facing some challenges due to the emergence of airbnb and alike platforms nevertheless it is clear that given the privilege locations they are both quite valuable assets taking into account a normalized level of noi we believe a 6 5 cap rate represents a

rate 2 471m hk 7 3 hk per share 2 macao ocean gardens these are actually the overlooked assets and they represent the most straightforward catalyst for the re rating of the stock these properties are

being located in ocean garden og on taipa island these properties were developed in the early 2000s together with other buildings in the ocean garden area the company disposed several of these properties during the 2000s but they kept 140 unit apartments 389 612 sqft gross area and 758 car parks units company actually owns 70 6 stake therefore equivalent to 275 105 sqft and 535 car park units ocean park picture from oceangardens com mo keck seng properties in ocean garden picture from google since 2013 the company has not sold any apartment in ocean garden and successive chairman statements have suggested why management s strategy is to hold the properties till completion of major developments such as the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge hkzm bridge and others and to capitalize then on increasing prices â it is the view of the directors that the completion of the hong kong zhuhai macao bridge will have a strong positive impact on the value of residential properties in macaoâ â the group has decided to defer the sale of the properties currently classified under properties held for sale to a later time in order to capture the benefits to be accrued with the opening of the hong kong zhuhai macau bridge and the macau light rail transit system in the meantime the group will continue to lease out vacant units in order to maximize income â visualcapitalist com hkzm bridge is the worldâ s longest bridge over water 48km and it links the two sides of one of the most populated metropolitan areas in the world pearl river delta 50 million people the bridge was supposed to be finished by 2017 but it finally got inaugurated in october 2018 it is expected to boost further the already rapidly growing economy of the region we can find additional information about developments in taipa in the annual report of las vegas sands corporation â based on announced plans in macao approximately 7 billion of capital is expected to be invested by concessionaires and sub concessionaires in new resort development projects on cotai with announced opening dates through 2018 to 2020 in total these new projects will add approximately 3 400 incremental hotel rooms along with other non gaming offerings and gaming capacity these new resorts should further drive macao s transformation into a leading business and leisure tourism hub in asia more than 1 0 billion people are estimated to live within a three hour flight from macao and more than 3 0 billion people are estimated to live within a five hour flight from macao â at first the management decision of delaying the sale of ocean garden assets seems to be a savvy choice looking to maximize shareholders value it is also true that this decision may be one of the factors having caused the lag of the share price in the past years in comparison with its book value another way to approach the value of ocean garden assets is referring to the average transactional price for residential properties in taipa published by macaoâ s statistics and census service dsec source author based on company data selling prices in macao and taipa have risen dramatically in the past decade but the company has kept the value of these assets at cost listing comparables in ocean garden show asking prices of around 7 500 hk sqft for car parks the asking price in the area is around 1 5m hk source author based on company data as we can see in the table below between 2012 and 2013 the company sold the last till date apartments at 5 000 6 700 hk sqft at that time the company was selling these apartments at 7x 9x their cost and at very low cap rates 1 5 2 0 we can reason that the company s decision to delay the sales of apartments will translate in at least if not better sales price above 6 000 hk sqft on the other hand it can be arguable whether or not it makes sense speculating on property prices renting the apartments at 2 yields instead of gradually disposing of them source author based on company data we

was an average annual noi of hk 227m in order to explain how we get the final valuation we explain in detail the calculations we estimate the noi contribution of each hotel taking into account the number of rooms in each hotel 497 335 and the last reported revpar 117 78 hkd arriving to an estimated noi contribution of each hotel 69 31 being 157m and 70m hkd as the tenure of these two leaseholds expires in 2042 we want also to account for the possibility that vietnam government ask for a renovation fee we then decide to also deduct a tenure discount of 20 in order to account for this potential cost to sum up we approach to the valuation corresponding to keck seng s stake taking each separate noi 157m 70m applying a capitalisation rate 10 accounting for the company interest 64 25

and ocean tower according to the company reports they are accounted for at fair value surveyed by independent firm jll in june 2018 for 822m taking into consideration available listing comparables and a more conservative approach we arrive at a valuation of hk 650m other held for sale hfs properties as commented at the beginning of this report macao properties located within ocean garden are the main assets under the classification of hfs properties see comments above although this has a tiny marginal impact taking into consideration available listing comparables the company possesses some other properties that we value at hk 145m net liabilities at a consolidated level in h1 2018 the group reports hk 1 656m of deposits cash and hk 2 104m total liabilities 1 522m bank debt translating in a position of hk 448m net liabilities additionally the group reports hk 655m as minority interests ksi does not segment data for all asset types therefore we take a conservative approach to deduct the full amount of minority interests assuming the probable drawback of deducting them twice remember that we have performed an individualized asset valuation deducting already the minority part nav calculation adding up all items and deducting total liabilities and minority interests we arrive at a nav of hk 6 75bn or the equivalent to a hk 19 9 per share current stock price implies a discount of 71 on nav for a conservative assumption of 12x p e or 10x p fcf target the valuation is only slightly above the current price target price of hk 6 per share similarly if we target fcf yield at 15 we get a valuation of hk 7 as commented earlier this must be one of the reasons of the current valuation the company is not outperforming as they are renting the macau apartments below 2 cap rates on the other hand as it was commented earlier the mispricing comes from approaching the company from an implied rate or nav perspective performing a sum of the parts if we estimate a 2018 ebitda of c hk 540m and an enterprise value of hk 2 2bn we get a 2018e high 25 implied cap rate a more realistic cap rate would be in the 10 range implying target share prices around hk 16 17 per share from an nav perspective after we take the sotp valuation hk 19 9 we can apply a discretionary discount for being a holding company asian small cap accounting for capital gains etc we take 25 and we arrive at a hk 15 target price per share in conclusion if ksi continues to be valued with earnings metrics there is little upside between 9 and 11 cagr but if they start to sell the hfs properties nav can be partially realized and push prices up in the latter case we give a target price of hk 15 16 per share or equivalent in usd 1 90 2 05 bottom line currently keck seng trades at about hk 5 70 taking into consideration the quality of the assets we dissect the investment in three parts i us hotels represent the certainty and soundness to the valuation and generate some earnings together with the cash balance given to rest of the assets a zero valuation and deducting all liabilities would represent nav i hk 4 1 per share ii adding only vietnam contribution as a potential slow catalyst remember that this segment generates considerable amounts of operating cash flow nav i ii hk 6 9 per share iii adding ocean garden properties may be the most speculative but still quite certain about our conservative valuation represents the quick catalyst and it enlarges the upside nav i ii iii hk 13 3 per share iv adding all the rest of properties participations and assets japan canada china accor

moved too much in the past years and it could remain longer at low levels this risk is quite probable if management does not start to sell macao apartments only the cash generation hk 200m annually may make the stock price thrive slowly gaming industry regulation risk i macao belongs to china as special administrative region sra the value of ocean gardenâ s properties depends heavily on the strength of macao economy that at the same time it is mainly based on gaming industry revenues 28bn usd there are some uncertainties about the future developments of gaming laws in terms of the integration of gambling rules with mainland china the main risk would be in fact the legalization of gambling in mainland china that would erode macaoâ s advantage we believe this is an improbable event and even in the case this happens macao has already developed a tourism hub difficult to replicate we see the case of las vegas 11bn usd in gaming revenues as a very similar case in which the early advantage of nevada state legislation was not impacted by the later openings of new gambling hubs across the us atlantic city reno etc ii vietnam sheraton saigon hotel value and its slot machine revenues could be impacted due to changes in gaming laws for the time being vietnam government has shown a very open attitude in order to attract foreign investing see forbes and asiatimes articles we expect both local governments to continue to show a business friendly attitude corporate governance or fraud risk we can never avoid 100 this risk but to our knowledge we have not detected any red flag management track record reputable auditor consistent adjusted earnings vs cash flows and we believe the hk regulator to be quite strict surely more than many other western economies especially for enforcement of laws on a company registered under their jurisdiction tenure risk uncertainty about property rights after 2049 due to macao being a sar of china as well as hong kong there are some uncertainties as we get close to the date when the region will be integrated with mainland china however as it is the case in hong kong it seems that the most probable scenario is that the central government will grant renewals in exchange for a reasonable fee see savills article industry cycle and valuation imprecisions real estate specially hotel segment is quite cyclical and quite difficult to forecast as it depends not only on micro factors location general condition of the asset but also and strongly on macroeconomic factors affecting the business e g tourism rates and the land value e g alternative uses local economics etc this is in fact a quite intrinsic risk of a ksi but there are two factors that mitigate these risks i geographical diversification cycles do not usually happen matching phases in such different markets ii the valuation has a wide margin of safety to face potential shortcomings interest rates risks what happen with the increasing interest rates as the company is underlevered with a net cash position they would not suffer for servicing the debt and at the margin they would pay it off completely moreover usually if interest rates increase quickly it s because central banks fear inflation and real estate usually goes well if inflationary pressure arises recessionary impact what would happen in the case of a global crisis well in this case the company may suffer in the short term as hotel earnings tend to be affected however in the long term the company could take advantage of this situation as they did in the past given its financial strength the company would have opportunities to put its net cash position to work probably investing in distress situations similarly when they acquired the hotel w san francisco acknowledgments we

opinion they don t like in any case he advised as the issuer of currency the government of canada can never run out of money and can fund every single social requirement it faces including free education it is impossible for there to be a limit on the capacity of a sovereign government to pay debts denominated in its own currency well good to know helpfully the fellow appended a primer on modern monetary theory mmt which posits that the government not individuals or corporations owns the national currency and can print unlimited amounts of it without harmful consequence as long as it taxes enough of it back to keep spending in check and restrain inflation mmt the mmt school has been around for more than a century but seemed less loopy after western central banks responded to the 2008 financial meltdown by printing trillions of dollars and euros and yen without moving the inflation needle on the extreme other end of the philosophical spectrum are the germans whose leaders have all read faust by johann wolfgang von goethe and regard heterodox theories with aggressive suspicion in faust when the emperor wails about running out of gold the devil steps in with a suggestion since we know that most gold is yet to be mined counsels mephistopheles why not just issue promissory notes against its eventual retrieval basically the devil is suggesting printing money which the emperor does with predictable consequences there s a reason he s called the devil the fable has appeal i regard religion as superstition yet my soul is protestant my schoolteacher father would sternly intone that taking the easy way out always has consequences do the hard work first be the ant not the grasshopper that thinking eventually extends to every detail of life i cannot stand beginning the day with an unmade bed i have an irrational belief that suffering through winter somehow builds character i even masochistically savour a headwind on the outward part of a long bicycle ride with its promise of a tailwind on the road home seen with that worldview how can mounting debt not be a gravitational anxiety debt seems a vast sucking field of muck in which we flail unrepayable lifetime debt now seems to be a business model students enter the professional world owing hundreds of thousands and otherwise sane people carry heavy credit card balances with the usurious vig that comes with them the average canadian credit card debt depending on how you calculate it is as much as 8 000 statistics canada says canadians carry a total debt load of 179 per cent of their disposable income that is nosebleed level and it keeps rising and with every annual budget the federal and provincial governments take on more debt on our behalf yes i know you shouldn t conflate public and private debt but it all adds to that profound faustian unease in the united states president donald trump and the republicans denounced debt as a burden to our children and promised to get rid of the national debt in eight years instead under trump s guidance congressional republicans added 2 trillion think two million million dollar homes to the national debt in just two years the u s federal reserve as noted still has 4 trillion on its balance sheet thanks to its overheated printing press and there are signs that wall street s reckless debt merchants learned nothing last time around retirement vulnerability surely logic dictates that there will be a price to pay for all this that the bill will come due in a sense it already has the extremely low interest rates pursued by western central banks didn t just encourage years of feverish borrowing they have reduced some would say robbed virtuous savers of the returns they expected everywhere you read that canadians and americans are simply unprepared for retirement now experts on the subject do provide some comfort malcolm hamilton of the c d howe institute says retirement vulnerability at least in canada is grossly exaggerated by mainstream media the government takes good care of retired canadians he says lower income canadians will likely see little change in circumstance after they retire and higher income earners simply need to put their debts behind them or face living a more frugal existence later in life that said hamilton acknowledges the ground beneath us has shifted remarkably low interest rates have created an addiction to debt for individuals and for governments so he says central banks will likely have to keep interest rates low for decades to come because significant increases would create debt servicing charges that would cripple governments never mind mortgage holders at the same time a much smaller working population will be supporting a much larger retired population which incidentally will demand ever greater health care and social benefits the government takes good care of retired canadians hamilton says lower income canadians will likely see little change in circumstance after they retire paul chiasson the canadian press there are going to be profound consequences says hamilton there is no precedent for it there is no precedent for guidance you know someone is going to get hurt in the end but you don t know who or what to do to avoid being the person who gets hurt chris ragan the mcgill university economist i call when i want to be told everything will be all right says everything will likely be all right confidently rattling off statistics the way experts do it is true he says that a fiscal squeeze is coming as the population ages but that if governments start thinking about it now it s not something to worry about the trouble of course is that governments are terrible at thinking beyond the next election ragan says the trudeau government s spending has been scattershot and political rather than strategic reversing stephen harper s decision to raise the retirement age he says was foolish and government debt he says is not in itself a bad thing nor is printing money as long as markets remain confident which they do as for protestant caution ragan cites the thrift paradox it might be prudent for an individual but if everyone does it or if the government does it too much the economy goes into recession perhaps but a little dread never hurts i m going to keep making my bed this column is part of cbc s opinion section for more information about this section

the world bank s forecast marks a slight slowdown to last year s projected growth figures for the eurozone the us and commodity exporting nations are expected to reap the most benefits in 2017 the world bank said on tuesday it expected the eurozone to grow by 1 5 percent in 2017 a slight deceleration from the 1 6 percent increase in gdp seen last year growth is forecast to further slow down to 1 4 percent in 2018 according to the global economic prospects a report published bi annually by the world s leading lending agency despite the fractional reduction in growth the figures indicate that the eurozone economy is gradually recovering having endured years of stagnant growth in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent greek debt crisis global economic growth is expected to pick up slightly with global gdp set to expand at a 2 7 percent annual rate this year a marked boost to last year s 2 3 percent growth the worst global performance since the 2008 crisis we are encouraged to see stronger economic prospects on the horizon world bank president jim yong kim said strong us growth forecast under trump with caveats global economic prospects projects 2 2 percent growth in the us over the next year a significant boost from its estimated 1 6 percent growth in 2016 the upturn comes amid a rebound in us manufacturing and investment activity the world bank also projected that the us economy stood to see even greater expansion on the back of incoming president donald trump s proposed stimulus plan should it be enacted trump pledged during his campaign to cut taxes do away with red tape and boost infrastructure spending markets still can t decide whether trump will prove to be a blessing or a curse image getty images afp d roland however the world bank was quick to warn of trump s protectionist proposals to impose high tariffs on goods imported from countries such as mexico and china the global lender said that such policies risked starting a trade war hindering us growth prospects because of the outsize role the united states plays in the world economy changes in policy direction may have global ripple effects world bank economist ayhan kose said more expansionary u s fiscal policies could lead to stronger growth in the united states and abroad but changes to trade or other policies could offset those gains however kose said one simulation showed that trump s proposed tax cuts could see the us growth rate increase by three tenths this year and more than double in 2018 however the world bank warned that the federal reserve would need to be vigilant to stem any inflationary pressures spurred by the new administration s stimulus spending and tax cuts mixed outlook for emerging markets among the biggest winners this year will be commodity exporting countries the world bank said after dramatically slumping in 2015 commodity prices are expected to gradually recover in 2017 after growing by a barely discernible 0 3 percent last year commodity exporters should see their economies expand by some 2 1 percent russia brazil and argentina are anticipated to start growing again having all endured crippling recessions last year by contrast commodity importing emerging markets are forecast to see a slight slowdown in growth by a tenth to 5 6 percent on the back of trade growth and subdued investment gains kose warned that a drop off in investment was the most pressing issue facing the global economy while the world bank has not identified a smoking gun for the cause of the decline in investment likely factors are reduced investment into commodity industries and political uncertainty facing a number of developed and emerging economies dm mg ap afp

king banaian and rich macdonald st cloud state university the st cloud area economy continued to create employment over the year ending january 2019 and surveyed firms express little concern that the area economy will enter recession this year with year over year job growth of 1 4 percent st cloud was the state s second best performing metropolitan area in creating jobs over the past year lagging only rochester the construction manufacturing educational health and wholesale trade sectors of the local economy led the way in employment gains while the retail trade professional business services and leisure hospitality sectors shed jobs the future outlook of surveyed firms is solid and the st cloud index of leading economic indicators though down from a high earlier in 2018 points to continued growth over the next several months despite ongoing concerns about u s trade policy signals from the bond market that raise the fear of potential national recession and the looming future closure of electrolux the local economy appears to be poised to grow through the summer of 2019 more shopko to liquidate close all stores including st cloud s area firms do appear to be more concerned about the possibility of local recession in 2020 one third of surveyed firms believe the probability of local recession in 2020 is 50 percent or higher by comparison only 13 percent of firms think there is a 50 percent or higher chance of local recession this year for the second consecutive quarter nearly half of surveyed firms expect increased prices received over the next six months in a special question few firms report being unfavorably impacted by the 35 day federal government shutdown that lasted throughout most of january 2019 fifty seven percent of firms indicate the shutdown had no impact on their company while 32 percent reported a small unfavorable impact 5 key takeaways 1 private sector payroll employment in the st cloud area rose 1 5 percent from one year earlier in the 12 months through january 2019 the unemployment rate in the st cloud area in january rose to 4 8 percent from 4 5 percent one year ago this uptick in the local unemployment rate could have resulted from temporarily furloughed workers during the recent federal government shutdown we will be able to confirm this once the february local unemployment rate data are released associated with the rise in the local unemployment rate is a 0 9 percent year over year reduction in the local labor force while the decline in the local labor force is unlikely to have resulted from the shutdown it does have the effect everything else equal of increasing the unemployment rate since the labor force is in the denominator of the unemployment rate calculation 2 employment in the manufacturing sector grew by 2 5 percent over the year ending january 2019 this sector accounts for 14 1 percent of jobs in the st cloud area annual local job growth in the mining logging construction most of these jobs represent the construction industry sector surged by 19 1 percent and wholesale trade employment rose 2 6 percent the area educational health sector created 4 4 percent additional jobs over the year ending january 2019 sectors experiencing job gains represented approximately 58 percent of area employment over the past year local sectors that experienced year over year job losses include retail trade which shed 4 2 percent of its workers information professional business services leisure hospitality and federal government 3 the new st cloud index of leading economic indicators rose 1 6 percent in the november january quarter and is up 2 4 percent from a year ago the st cloud 13 stock price index fell 1 3 percent over the three months ending january 31 2019 with a strong january trimming a much larger drop at the end of 2018 over this same period the s p 500 fell 0 3 percent 4 the future outlook of those area businesses responding to the st cloud area business outlook survey was solid although it was weaker than one year ago fifty three percent of surveyed firms expect an increase in business activity over the next six months but 17 percent expect decreased activity these are the weakest numbers we have seen in the february future business activity index since february 2010 forty seven percent of surveyed firms expect to expand payrolls by august and 57 percent anticipate higher employee compensation similar to last quarter 49 percent of surveyed firms anticipate higher prices received by august 2019 and only two firms think prices will be lower this is the second highest value ever recorded on this survey item the area worker shortage is expected to continue although it does appear to be moderating 5 fifty seven percent of surveyed firms indicate the recent federal government shutdown had no impact on their company thirty two percent of firms experienced a small unfavorable impact of the shutdown no firms were favorably impacted when asked the probability that the local economy will enter recession in 2019 26 percent of surveyed firms indicate a 20 percent probability and another 26 percent think the probability is 30 percent no firms think the probability of local recession is higher than 80 percent this year and three firms feel there is a zero chance of a 2019 local recession nineteen percent of firms expect there is a 20 percent chance of local recession in 2020 and another 21 percent think the probability is 30 percent eleven percent of firms think the probability of local recession in 2020 is 40 percent and another 19 percent assign a 50 percent probability to the likelihood of a local recession next year on balance surveyed firms expect a greater likelihood of local recession in 2020 than in 2019 what is a local recession most economics teachers refer to national economies when talking about recession in our special questions in this issue of the st cloud area quarterly business report we have asked local businesses to estimate the probability of a local recession rather than a recession what one may ask is the difference the national economy consists of many local ones and these local ones have unique features in terms of labor force skills and industrial concentrations when some outside shock occurs some economies will react more sharply than others during the great recession shocks to the housing market struck areas which had large growth in real estate prices arizona california and nevada for example more than those that did not in addition places that produced goods that were in greater competition from china saw slower wage growth and did not recover as rapidly after the great recession as other places to see a local recession which hit st cloud but did not affect other places we offer this graph below of seasonally adjusted employment growth rates since 1989 for both st cloud and the state of minnesota recessions would be characterized by a drop in employment a negative growth rate the great recession is easy to see along with the national recessions in 1990 91 and 2001 but one sees a short drop in employment in late 1996 and a drop in early 2018 that are not duplicated in the state data the earlier period includes a june 1996 layoff of 200 workers at the then frigidaire now electrolux plant which is scheduled for future closing overall stearns county saw 1 757 initial claims for unemployment insurance from mass layoff initial claims in that period more than triple the amount of the previous year and more than 4 times the amount in 1997 the data show the concentration of reduced employment in the manufacturing sector as we have noted previously the st cloud economy also includes firms who produce transportation equipment shocks to the transportation equipment sector could also be an area where local recessions can happen without impacting a larger economy such as the state of minnesota local recessions however do not last long without a statewide or national recession labor mobility means that unemployed workers locally can find jobs elsewhere and a healthy state economy can absorb them neither the 1996 episode nor the more recent bout of labor demand weakness has endured though the recent slowing of the minnesota economy could make us less resilient should another local market shock occur survey results for standard questions current activity tables 1 and 2 report the most recent results of the st cloud area business outlook survey responses are from 47 area businesses that returned the recent mailing in time to be included in the report participating firms are representative of the diverse collection of businesses in the st cloud area they include retail manufacturing construction financial health services and government enterprises both small and large survey responses are strictly confidential written and oral comments have not been attributed to individual firms all of the current activity indexes found in table 1 are weaker than was reported one year ago and most index values are also lower than last quarter which is a normal seasonal occurrence a diffusion index represents the percentage of respondents indicating an increase minus the percentage indicating a decrease in any given quarter for any given item a positive index usually indicates expanding activity while a negative index implies declining conditions the index on current business activity is only slightly positive and as can be seen in the accompanying chart the current employment index is negative for the first time since february 2010 while employment levels at surveyed firms is expected to pick up over the next several months see table 2 it does appear the labor market weakened in february relative to normal conditions the index value on current length of workweek is the lowest recorded since february 2010 the diffusion index on employee compensation is the second highest ever recorded in the february survey as 53 percent of firms report higher wages and benefits over the past three months and no firms indicate a decrease in employee compensation the number of firms reporting increased difficulty attracting qualified workers over the past quarter is substantial but declining and the current reading is the lowest recorded in two years overall the four labor market survey indicators found in table 1 show a mixed performance of the area s labor market wages appear to be rising and firms appear to be having less concern meeting their labor demands while firm responses in table 2 indicate an expectation of being paid higher prices in the future the current prices received index in table 1 is actually the lowest value recorded since february 2017 the current national business activity index recorded its lowest value in nearly three years this quarter finally the accompanying chart shows the performance of the current capital expenditures index over the past 20 years readers will note the cyclical movements of this index with pronounced declines during the recessionary periods of 2001 2002 as well as 2008 2010 recessions are characterized by low business investment while this quarter s current capital expenditures index is still positive its value is the lowest recorded since february 2012 this index has now declined over the past four quarters and is well below its recent peak of 39 8 in august 2013 we don t think that the pattern of the current capital expenditures index suggests local recessionary conditions will appear any time soon but the recent trend on this survey item is well worth watching in future quarters as always firms were asked to report any factors that are affecting their business these comments include future outlook the future business conditions survey responses found in table 2 are somewhat weaker than is typically found in the february survey but they still represent a solid outlook for the area while local business leaders were more optimistic about future business conditions one year ago this quarter s survey suggests steady growth should continue through august 2019 for example the future business activity index registered a reading of 58 7 one year ago which was a particularly high reading for an economy in its 8th year of expansion at a level of 36 2 this quarter s future business activity index was considerably lower however 53 percent of surveyed firms still expect to expand activity over the next 6 months and relatively few firms expect activity to decline likewise the diffusion index on the level of employment was higher one year ago but with a value of 44 7 it is one of the highest values recorded over the past several years forty seven percent of surveyed firms expect to expand payrolls over the next six months and only one firm anticipates declining employment the accompanying chart shows that the future employment index is at a strong level one that is consistent with a healthy economy we also note that two other labor market indicators future length of workweek and future employee compensation also performed well in this quarter s survey more city s new business development director will lead economic recovery program the relative weakness we saw in the current capital expenditures index in table 1 seems to not be a problem with future capital expenditures nearly one third of surveyed firms expect to expand capital purchases over the next six months and only 3 firms plan to cut back on capital spending there is also little concern with future national business activity thirty percent of survey respondents expect national activity to be higher in august 2019 and another 47 percent see it as unchanged relatively few firms 11 percent expect national activity to decline over the next six months whatever the weakness local businesses experienced the last few months their outlook for the future is stronger this report has once again emphasized the extent to which area firms are expecting to receive higher prices in the future the diffusion index on future prices received in table 2 is the second highest level recorded in the 20 year history of the local survey only last quarter s future prices received index recorded a higher value as was noted last quarter not even during the high flying years of 2004 2005 did as many area businesses expect price increases we note that the exact nature of expected higher future prices received is unknown it might be because firms costs are increasing or alternatively local firms may have gained more pricing power and improved profit margins regardless this survey item further highlights the importance of paying attention to area pricing data in the coming months see accompanying chart finally as we have noted on several occasions in the st cloud area quarterly business report the future difficulty attracting qualified workers diffusion index has typically followed a cyclical pattern that resembles the path of economic activity experienced in the overall economy we have traditionally kept a close eye on this chart since the expected future labor shortages implied by this index seem to signal the future economic performance of the local economy similar to last quarter the accompanying chart suggests that this index is now starting to decline as it has fallen for five consecutive quarters as can be seen in the chart this index has typically followed a cyclical pattern with no apparent seasonal variation so the recent downward path of this index hints at a recent slowing of local business conditions compared to the elevated levels of one year ago we do note that the index values found in the accompanying chart are still way above what was observed during the recessionary periods of 2001 2002 and 2008 2010 survey results for special questions special question 1 the effect of the federal government shutdown on area businesses on december 22 2018 a partial federal government shutdown began as congress and the administration experienced disagreements over federal budget priorities among other things the shutdown spanned 35 days ending january 25 2019 over which time several federal government workers and government contractors were furloughed a possible second shutdown that might have influenced survey respondents never materialized anecdotal evidence suggests the shutdown had relatively little impact on the performance of the overall economy we do note that the white house council of economic advisors estimated a reduction of gdp in this year s first quarter of approximately 0 5 percent as a result of the federal government shutdown but we were interested in the extent to which local firms were impacted we asked fifty seven percent of survey respondents selected no impact and another 32 percent indicated small unfavorable impact six percent of firms experienced a medium unfavorable impact and one firm had a large unfavorable impact from the government shutdown we asked businesses to comment on their response these comments include delay getting mortgage loans approved consumer and business sba office closed accessing services to do our work was stalled as we awaited the government reopening we were unable to do sba loans during the shutdown nothing has really changed at our firm no effect we did not feel any impact centers for medicare medicaid office slowed getting questions answered our business continued to expand at a normal pace we don t work with government enterprises makes one wonder when 800 000 federal workers are not working and there is little to no effect on most people or businesses overblown i am sure it has had a residual effect on all businesses because of the unknown the political scene no matter what side you are on is a dangerous one small impact due to some government agencies closed polar vortex winter storms had a bigger effect some grant funding had potential to be delayed but never was our sba financing has been delayed causing cash flow issues people very nervous to spend large difficult to measure more shutdowns will cause many problems to our ability to deliver services special question 2 the probability of local recession in 2019 at this year s winter institute federal reserve bank of st louis president and scsu grad jim bullard made three key observations about the us economy first he was unconcerned about unanticipatedly high inflation rates since it appeared that the marketplace expected future annual inflation rates to be below the fed s two percent target second tight labor markets are not currently creating inflationary wage pressures these first two observations suggest the fed doesn t need to be in any particular hurry to hike its interest rate targets third he expressed concern about an inverted yield curve a situation in which interest rates in the market for short term u s treasury securities are higher than the yields on longer term securities this is an unusual situation and often happens before national recessions the yield curve in the u s treasuries market has now flattened out and while not strictly inverted it is easy to see how this would be a concern for federal reserve policymakers with this observation in mind and with the ongoing concern about local retail store closings and the looming closure of electrolux we decided to ask area businesses about the likelihood of local recession in both 2019 and 2020 while a discussion of what a local recession looks like appears elsewhere in this report we note that recessions usually take the form of declining output reduced employment an increase in unemployment a loss of sales a reduction of industrial production lower incomes etc most national observers think the u s will continue to experience economic growth throughout 2019 albeit at a slower rate than was observed in 2018 although there has been some concern about economic weakness in 2020 so we asked area businesses the following question only 12 8 percent of respondents feel the probability of a local recession this year is 50 percent or higher the most common responses were 20 percent and 30 percent which were each chosen by 26 percent of the sample of those who answered this question the median response was 20 percent only three firms think the probability of local recession this year is zero percent and no firms feel the probability is 80 percent or above special question 3 the probability of local recession in 2020 the third special question is virtually the same as the previous question with the exception that it asks about the probability of local recession next year we asked area firms are a little more concerned about the possibility of local recession next year than they are about recession occurring in 2019 thirty four percent of responding firms think there is at least a 50 percent probability of local recession next year only one firm thinks the probability is zero percent and no firms think there is a 100 percent probability the most common response to this item is 30 percent and the median response of those who answered the question is also 30 percent written comments to special questions 2 and 3 include fundamentals of the economy are strong our customers are all expanding it severely impacts our business activity heavily in a negative way we anticipate a slight recession so we are scrutinizing new loan deals differently i think it s a really small chance maybe as we get closer to the 2020 election it can depend on who s in the race only a guess our industry outlook is positive and we re more impacted by slightly more macro factors with divided government not much will pass so most likely they won t be able to screw things up i believe we could see a mild recession in 2020 2021 a recession is always a concern hopefully it s not as long and deep as the 08 09 recession increasing interest rates it is always on the radar because of the increased costs of government regulations the lack of higher paying jobs in this area to buy our services and the increase in people needing aid the work force can only support so much aid since we are a national international supplier a global recession would affect us much more than a local recession would however if it was local only the opportunity to hire more qualified individuals is sure enticing may actually help free up workers we can grow through a recession we expect it but feel the impact will be less than most recessions in slowing local economy or its duration very difficult to predict so many factors will influence this the election year cycle will factor into people and business confidence levels it will be a bitter election let s hope that if there is a recession that it is painless as possible and short short short we are very diversified with few large vulnerable employers feds are screwing things up farmers have not had good farm sales going on 3 years always concerned with medicare and medicaid cuts the cost of new single family housing will drop 5 10 because of lower lumber costs the higher interest rates have lowered housing prices by 7 10 in the st cloud metro area sartell is a good example 3 2018 vs 9 2018 the farm economy is struggling with low commodity prices milk prices and higher interest on operating loans the chinese trade war may be coming to an end which will be good for the farm sector in addition the african swine flu has hurt the chinese hog industry which may be a boost to the us hog industry health insurance is a major concern as premiums rise and decrease disposable income the farm economy impacts us plus the dollar stores moving in are hurting main street businesses employment is very good margins have been squeezed with higher costs some correction possible we are dependent on the construction industry and are concerned with any slowdowns or declines in building i am particularly concerned about the potentially negative effect a broad economic slowdown could have on an already stressed local ag economy tariffs limiting agricultural exports and hurting the ag economy slowdown in employment electrolux shutting down along with other retail outlets we already are feeling a recession in our sector with lower prices hurting revenue stream local sales are a minor part of our business no workers may improve hiring for us a drop in local commercial construction is a concern strong manufacturing construction sector buoy local economy at end of 2018 total non agricultural employment in the st cloud area rose 1 4 percent in the twelve months through january 2019 as seen in table 3 this was faster than any region in the state except rochester growth was centered on the goods producing sectors of the local economy with construction employment rising 19 1 percent over the period the january construction number is particularly strong perhaps reflecting the increased activity associated with two major projects in the area that are able to continue through the winter costco and technical high school most service sector industries in the st cloud area saw declines in employment over the 12 month period the education and health sector grew once more accelerating above its long run average while the opposite trend happened elsewhere in the state the information sector and retail trade both declined in the period leisure and hospitality employment declined in st cloud while growing elsewhere this despite reports that 2018 food and beverage tax and hotel motel tax revenue both rose in 2018 though january 2019 hotel motel receipts were down slightly household employment data are shown in table 4 the 0 9 percent drop in the labor force for the st cloud metropolitan statistical area is matched by a 2 1 percent drop for duluth and a 3 2 percent drop for mankato while the twin cities was virtually flat and rochester s labor force grew 1 8 percent these data are somewhat volatile and subject to revision but it will be a year before we know about these january data the minnesota department of employment and economic development s deed alternative measures of unemployment do not show any impact of the federal government shutdown on reported labor force statistics at the state level so we do not know how to explain this unexpected drop despite strong construction employment growth residential building permits valuations were down in the city of st cloud unemployment insurance claims over the quarter fell by 9 8 reflecting the tight labor market conditions in the region our new st cloud index of leading economic indicators rose 2 4 percent in the last year the st cloud 13 stock price index marked a decline of 15 6 percent over the 12 months to january 31 2019 as one can see from the nearby graph the index dropped precipitously over the last quarter but then recovered in early 2019 in the last quarter through january 31 5 stocks

to find the production of data that measure local economies changing the latest iteration did not give us an effective way to tell our readers how the various components impact the series because we are using a different mixed data frequency method that combines quarterly survey data with monthly measurements from a variety of sources this method does not allow us to define the magnitude of changes as we did previously in table 5 we are now able to at least tell you the direction of change for the next period if not the magnitude while the 12 month change in the leading indicators series looks good the three most recent figures are below the peak in the leading indicators series reached in the first quarter of 2018 new business incorporations and future conditions reported in the st

islamabad pakistan and the imf have inched closer towards inviting the fund s mission next month for evolving consensus on staff level agreement as islamabad is willing to replace from managed exchange rate to market based flexible exchange rate in order to secure multibillion bailout package with placement of market based flexible exchange rate there will be zero net intervention from the central bank into currency market by end of every quarter as this policy will pave the way for further adjustment of rupee against dollar for achieving equilibrium in the exchange rate the defining of finalised parameters for placing market based flexible exchange rate will come under discussion when the imf mission is likely to visit pakistan after mid april 2019 the newly appointed imf s mission chief ernesto ramirez rigo is scheduled to visit pakistan on march 26 and 27 so the currency market remains jittery on the expectation that the market based flexible exchange rate will result into putting pressure on rupee against dollar there is no range of exchange rate as the real effective exchange rate reer model runs by us shows that the rupee is overvalued by rs2 80 against dollar and this kind of adjustment could be made said the sources minister for finance asad umar is scheduled to visit washington from april 10 to 12 for attending annual spring meeting of imf wb and on the sidelines the imf mission details will be worked out with the fund management however independent economists argued that the market was not too big and free float of exchange rate could rife speculations according to initial assessment with the placement of market based flexible exchange rate the rupee might witness some slide against us dollar hovering around rs150 against us dollar in coming weeks and months however the state bank of pakistan is arguing that the central bank might continue intervening in day to day affairs of the market but there might be certain period when there would be zero net intervention on the basis of end of every quarter because pakistan s currency market is very volatile and complete free float might result into rise in speculations one top official who is dealing with this issue told the news on monday that pakistan and the imf assessed that pakistani rupee was still overvalued in the range of 2 to 3 percent keeping in view the real effective exchange rate reer so it could not be termed the range of disequilibrium they said that there could be two objectives of the sbp one is to protect the currency market and second is to increase the foreign currency reserves when pakistan possessed sufficient reserves it protected its market but now the reserves were on decline so the currency could not be protected for longer period the government thinks that the effective management of exchange rate has provided dividends as the current account deficit decreased from over 1 2 billion in december 2018 to over 800 million in january 2019 and now it stood at 356 million in february 2019 when the official was reminded that the foreign currency reserves were still depleting as it nosedived by 93 million despite massive decline in current account deficit the official said that the heavy repayments were due so it was causing pressures on foreign exchange reserves the imf in its initial assessment gave prescription that pakistan is facing an increasingly difficult macroeconomic situation with a large balance of payment gap a fiscal deficit and growing losses in state owned enterprises soes defence of an overvalued exchange rate loose fiscal policy and accommodative monetary policy are among the major root causes of these challenges talking to reporters renowned economist dr hafiz a pasha said on monday that free float of exchange rate could rise speculations so pakistan should move towards bringing real effective exchange rate which shows that the rupee was still overvalued in the range of up to 3 percent he deplored at the capacity of the ministry of finance and stated that the current account deficit decreased which was welcome sign but the ability to generate dollar inflows from traditional partners also eroded badly and the government must not show laxity on external front at all

canada s federal budget 2019 included a new program to help first time homebuyers along with other selected measures while keeping a key metric of the nation s indebtedness on a declining trend ottawa canada s federal budget 2019 included a new program to help first time homebuyers along with other selected measures while keeping a key metric of the nation s indebtedness on a declining trend i want to be very clear that this is a budget for people and for communities all across this country morneau said in his speech in the house of commons the government remained focused on a declining debt to gdp ratio rather than a path to balancing the books this key federal ratio is projected to decline from 30 8 percent to 28 6 percent by 2023 which is the lowest in the g7 the federal deficit is projected to decline from 19 8 billion to 9 8 billion over the next five years net government spending is projected to increase by 200 million in 2019 20 and by 1 6 billion in 2020 21 over and above what was announced in the 2018 fall economic statement it gets cut by a total of 2 5 billion over the final three years of the projection horizon morneau defended the government s investments in middle class canadians while staying fiscally responsible as reporters questioned him about still not having a plan to balance the books we ve done this by maintaining a good fiscal track he said in a pre budget press conference on march 19 avery shenfeld cibc s chief economist said that the new thinking among serious academic economists is that in a low interest rate environment which has been the case for the last 10 years debts and deficits aren t as worrisome running a deficit which is still less than 1 percent of gdp a year is not going to burden our children with huge interest payments to come shenfeld said in an interview in the government s favour is that its cost of debt is about 2 5 percent according to 2017 public accounts adjusted for inflation it is lower than the rate of economic growth research has found that the costs of public debt are low when a country s economic growth rate is higher than the inflation adjusted interest rate on its public debt it s just arithmetic said bank of canada senior deputy governor carolyn a wilkins in a speech on march 14 help buying homes as the housing market cools notably in vancouver and toronto and affordability remains poor the government s measure to aid first time homebuyers has the canada mortgage and housing corp cmhc financing a share of the equity in the new home the government envisions about 100 000 first time homebuyers benefiting from the innovative program over the next three years we are exactly dealing with the challenge that people face in getting into a new home morneau said the program serves to reduce the size of an insured mortgage so for a 400 000 home with a 5 percent down payment and 10 percent cmhc shared equity the mortgage would be reduced from 380 000 to 340 000 assuming a 3 5 percent mortgage rate the monthly payment is cut by 228 the amount financed by cmhc would have to be paid back once the house is sold further details are to be released later this year but the program is expected to go into force in september the government did not change the maximum amortization term for mortgages from 25 years to 30 years as some media reports suggested it might in order to help millennial first time homebuyers that change might have brought fears of borrowers piling on more debt and further inflating housing markets but morneau doesn t have that fear about the shared equity program saying the measure helps people be less indebted as they buy their first homes we know that it s not going to make an impact on the overall market from a pricing standpoint meaning people are actually going to be better off more optimism in terms of housing he said the cost of the first time home buyer incentive is up to 1 25 billion over three years and another 100 million for a fund that will provide loans to third party shared mortgage providers so they can scale up their businesses because we ve given a larger opportunity for homes that are brand new we are actually increasing the supply of homes in the country which we know is critically important to deal with the dearth of new home opportunities especially in places like toronto and vancouver morneau said shenfeld was more sanguine on the impact of the housing measure saying that the best thing for homebuyers is letting the market adjust left on its own the market might correct enough shenfeld said while spending on residential housing had been a big driver of economic growth it has been tailing off with the biggest culprit being the federal regulator s b20 mortgage stress tests lack of housing supply in key markets is the bigger problem and shenfeld says the federal government doesn t really have the jurisdiction to deal with it it s more the provinces and the municipalities have together to ensure that we re getting enough increased density enough home construction he said that s ultimately what can help homebuyers not anything on the demand side so far so good the canadian economy has recently started to hit some bumps in the road after a period of stronger economic growth which helped revenues rise and kept deficits from widening insidiously nevertheless canada is expected to benefit from having the second strongest projected economic growth after the united states in the g7 at 1 9 percent over the next two years in effect the liberals have had more money to spend but should the economy slow further the government will be expected to ramp up spending to temper the weakness budget 2019 was expected to include new government spending with an eye on the election and possibly to divert attention from the worsening snc lavalin scandal it was also expected to focus on the individual rather than business in sum shenfeld described budget 2019 as more of a sprinkling of tax credits and some small spending items it s not a budget designed therefore to give a huge lift to gdp growth in the near term he said whether there are some other bigger ticket items that will be in the election platform rather in the budget remains to be seen
opinion when the africa continental free trade area is implemented this year it will create a single market for goods and services for the first time in the continent s history the agreement will cover a geographic area with a combined gdp of 3 2 trillion and a population of 1 2 billion people it has the potential to drastically accelerate economic growth and exceed the african development bank s current estimates for gdp growth from 1 7 trillion in 2010 to more than 15 trillion by 2060 this has the potential to shift africa from being an aid dependent continent to becoming an investment dependent continent according to the brookings institute african foreign direct investment fdi inflows accounted for only 2 9 percent of total global fdi inflows in 2017 compared to the 49 8 percent share for developed economies and 10 6 percent for latin america and the caribbean a continental super bloc has the potential of creating an attractive value proposition for investors who are dealing with the fallout from brexit a u s china tariff war and a global economy that is falling short of projected growth targets
jorge martin takes recent gabriel hetland articles to task questioning the liberal left s assessment of the current situation and the solutions proposed by jorge martin march 17 2019 in defence of marxism there is a certain trend of opinion amongst the liberal left particularly in the us which never felt very comfortable with the bolivarian revolution now in the midst of a serious and well organised attempt by washington to remove maduro s government they insist on equally blaming both sides for the crisis one which in their view can be resolved through negotiations between the government and the opposition a chief representative of this point of view is gabriel hetland who has written several articles on venezuela for the nation jacobin and other left wing publications his latest article venezuela s deadly blackout highlights the need for a negotiated resolution of the crisis sums up this argument neatly so it is useful to analyse it in some detail the article is full of inaccuracies and half truths but its main flaw is a mistaken analysis of the situation in venezuela one that avoids a class approach to the different forces involved from which hetland derives a completely utopian solution the devil s in the details let s start with some of the factual inaccuracies the caption of the picture illustrating the articles reads people collect water from a leaking pipeline along the guaire river the same line is then used within the article for effect it is false during the blackout there was lack of water supply as a result people resorted to collecting water from springs coming down the avila mountain some of these springs are canalised and then end up in the guaire river people were collecting water from two such springs on the side of the guaire not from a leaking pipe water pipes were actually not carrying water this might seem like a small detail but it has a certain importance the headlines in many of the newspapers claimed people were collecting water from the guaire river itself which is extremely polluted el nuevo herald in miami said desperate venezuelans collect rotten water in the midst of blackout the mass media exaggerates and sometimes publishes straight lies in order to fit into a narrative of harrowing crisis in venezuela in order to justify the need for foreign intervention or in any case regime change hetland is not new to this business and should know he needs to check all the details he uses in his story another one in the opening paragraph of his article hetland seeks to draw attention to how bad and long lasting the blackout was he does mention how power was intermittently restored on sunday and monday in parts of caracas and elsewhere but then ends the paragraph with a mention of the new york times headline with the new york times on monday publishing an article titled no end in sight to venezuela s blackout experts warn what s the conclusion he wants the reader to draw that the blackout is far from over in fact we don t know when power will be restored at all there is just a small detail it does not coincide with the facts by midnight 11 march power had been restored in merida zulia and táchira the last remaining states affected by the blackout hetland s article carries the date of 13 march when the blackout was already over and there were only a few smaller towns left affected in paragraph two hetland states the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals of course the lack of power in hospitals is alarming and very dangerous however all hospitals in the country have their own independent power generators that activate in the event of an emergency a report by the opposition aligned ngo médicos por la salud published on 11 march in the evening a list of all 32 of the country s hospitals with a detailed explanation of their situation in all of them their own power plants were working with the exception of one where it was working intermittently heltand then adds to be blunt people are dying and more will die the longer the blackout continues to back up his assertion he links to a reuters report which quotes from medicos por la salud saying that 17 people have died as a result of problems with electricity supply when you then look at the ngo s own report the picture is less clear in the report about the state of hospitals which i quoted above of the 32 hospitals listed all bar two are marked as no deceased and the other two account for a total of three people dead in a separate report by the same ngo about the number of people who died during the blackout 24 are listed but no details are given as to the causes of death so these could be people who would have died regardless of the blackout again this might seem a small detail but details are important because they are what build a story a story can be constructed in two ways one would say hospitals dealt with the blackout by using their own emergency generators which greatly minimised the dangerous impact of lack of electricity the other says the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals to be blunt people are dying and more will die you are more likely to write the second if you rely largely or solely on material from reuters and other such agencies and you are also more likely to stray from the truth what caused the blackout of course heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given what does he tell us about it he starts by saying there are two competing narratives a word i particularly hate but neither he goes on does justice to venezuela s reality in heltand s opinion the blackout and the broader crisis are not entirely the fault of maduro nor of the united states and the domestic opposition the urgency of the situation demands recognition of shared responsibility for the crisis but then hetland states that only the most myopic analysis could ignore the government s clear responsibility for the perilous state of venezuela s electric grid and goes on to give as an example the scandal of the tacoma hydro plant a project that was never finished as a result of corruption even here he gets some facts wrong by using a report that is now outdated however the question is how does a non functioning power plant relate to the current blackout everyone government and opposition agrees that something went wrong inside the control centre for the el guri hydro complex the dispute is about what caused the fault the opposition says it was a wildfire under the main high power line out of el guri while the government claims it was a cyber attack affecting the scada system that regulates the plant which produces 80 percent of venezuela s power what is heltand s opinion about this he does not say though he of course mentions the possibility of a cyberattack quoting an article from forbes he does not go into any of the details and his conclusion is clear available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage but by the electric grid being pushed to the brink by years of increased use and a lack of investment and maintenance available evidence perhaps heltand knows more than everyone else because so far neither the government nor the opposition have provided much if any evidence to back up their stories their arguments are mostly based on circumstantial evidence the opposition has not provided any evidence of the mysterious wildfire that they say affected the 765kv power line and then caused the el guri system to shut down which should be relatively simple if such a fire had occurred furthermore guaidó rejected the idea of a cyber attack as he alleged that the el guri hydro complex was controlled analogically something that is a straight lie all of these things are being widely discussed in venezuela with claims and counter claims being made heltand ignores all of this and simply claims that available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage without even mentioning what is this available evidence he bases himself upon or providing any useful links as a reference in fact he has already decided on an explanation that fits his narrative and has written a story that ignores the available evidence just to cover himself after having declared what the cause of the blackout is he adds getting to the bottom of the blackout is important journalists based in venezuela should investigate the possible causes yes mr hetland getting to the bottom of the blackout is important jumpìng to conclusions based on preconceived ideas does not help journalists based in venezuela have already done a very good job of attempting to establish what actually happened and this article in 15 y último is perhaps one of the best efforts it was published on 11 march two days before hetland s article was published in the nation the path of negotiation however the main problem with heltand s article lies in the conclusions he draws calls for military intervention must be rejected one must recognize however the untenability of the status quo the combination of maduro s repressive and inept rule and debilitating us sanctions has brought venezuela to the edge of catastrophe the longer the situation continues the worse things will get yes on one thing we can certainly agree the situation in venezuela is bad and has significantly worsened over the last four or five years but what is the plausible path for resolving venezuela s crisis that he proposes first of all he accepts the premise that a peaceful transition needs to take place and this must be through free and fair elections here we see how our liberal critic in fact accepts all of the premises of regime change on which us imperialism bases its current assault on venezuela washington too says it is for a peaceful transition and above all for free elections in fact this is precisely what nominally they are trying to achieve with their policy of diplomatic pressure sanctions and the threat of military intervention hetland therefore assumes without explaining why that the presidential elections in 2018 were not free and fair and that therefore maduro is an illegitimate president otherwise why should there be new elections when he was just sworn in in january our liberal friend finds himself firmly in the camp of the venezuelan opposition and us imperialism his disagreement with imperialism seems to be just tactical he does not think that this outcome can or should be achieved through sanctions or military action he seems to will the ends but not the means how does he think this can be achieved then the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian and ignores venezuela s recent past in fact over the years there have been many negotiations between the government and the opposition the current attempt by imperialism is not the first already in april 2002 the opposition carried out a us backed coup barely three years into the chavez government when president chavez was returned to power by a mass movement of the poor what did he do he called on the opposition to the negotiating table how did they respond by immediately starting to prepare for another coup this time in the form of the sabotage of the oil industry and a bosses lockout which lasted from december 2002 until february 2003 and nearly crippled the economy the opposition does not want negotiations they want to crush the bolivarian revolution by any means necessary if they think they can achieve this via negotiations they will not object as long as their objectives are guaranteed the most recent attempt at negotiations was the 2016 17 talks in the dominican republic brokered amongst others by the former social democratic president of spain zapatero the main demand of the opposition in those talks was precisely free and fair early presidential elections when it seemed that an agreeable compromise had been reached and even a date for the elections had been fixed then the opposition under pressure from bogotá and washington decided to walk out of the talks zapatero was fuming and he advised the government to go ahead with the elections on the agreed date the election in which a section of the opposition led by henri falcon participated did take place maduro won and zapatero who acted as an observer vouched for the process but all of this appears to be a closed book to hetland and who is the government supposed to negotiate with throughout his article and in other writings hetland insists on establishing a difference between radical sectors of the opposition or sectors of the far right opposition and the opposition as a whole in practice on the ground such a difference does not exist the current coup attempt led in venezuela by guaidó is backed by all the opposition parties represented in the national assembly the 2016 violent riots which hetland mentions in his article were also part of a joint and united campaign by the opposition as a whole the bulk of the opposition under pressure from washington boycotted the presidential election and expelled henri falcón from the mud democratic unity roundtable for taking part in it in any case how are these negotiations going to happen the government has said repeatedly that it is prepared to negotiate even with trump but the opposition has rejected any advances hetland suggests that perhaps the eu s international contact group could make this happen this is either naïve or seriously dangerous the main eu countries are completely subordinate to washington s strategy on venezuela it was spanish president sanchez who issued an eight day ultimatum to maduro to call presidential elections he was then joined by france the uk germany and the majority of eu members who went on to recognise guaidó as the legitimate president of venezuela the icg was only created in order to destroy mexico s independent initiative to find a negotiated solution when the icg representatives arrived in montevideo the uruguayan government under pressure abandoned its independent position and left mexico on its own you cannot have half a revolution to add to hetland s mythical unicorn of a democratic opposition he then adds that once the us is removed from the equation how by whom then we can hope hope springs eternal in the liberal breasts for a growth of a much broader opposition movement one in which the voices of the popular classes could have much more weight this is perhaps the crux of the matter the main problem in hetland s approach is the lack of any discussion of the class nature of this conflict the venezuelan opposition and behind it washington represents the interests of the country s oligarchy the rich and wealthy families that have ruled venezuela for over a 100 years and playing a subordinate role to us imperialism their mass base of support is mainly drawn from the middle class and upper middle class areas in the east of caracas and other major cities chavismo has its roots amongst the working class the poor peasants and the urban poor the opposition supporters have an irrational hatred a primal fear of the chavista masses during the violent opposition rioting in 2016 a young man orlando figuera was burnt alive and died as a result his crime being dark skinned and therefore looking both poor and like a chavista certainly in this opposition the voices of the popular classes have no weight for good reason most of the venezuelan poor and the working class have a healthy class instinct and they reject an opposition that they correctly see as representing los amos del valle the age old oligarchy abiding by the interests of imperialism the maduro government has had a policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class this has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution what progressives need to discuss is the root cause of the crisis in venezuela and on that basis discuss a solution that benefits the country s working people the frightful economic crisis from which venezuela is suffering was triggered in 2014 by the collapse in the price of oil and has been aggravated by some of the government s policy decisions deficit financing paying the foreign debt widespread corruption and us sanctions but its root cause are the well meaning attempts of the bolivarian government to regulate the capitalist economy through price and foreign exchange controls and robust labour and trade union legislation in order to protect the interests of the many this does not work capitalism cannot be regulated if such a thing is attempted capitalists resort to any measures necessary legal or illegal to circumvent such controls establish systems by which they end up benefiting from them foreign currency speculation black marketeering hoarding and generally resort to sabotage investment strikes and capital flight venezuela is a textbook case of this there are therefore only two solutions to the untenable status quo hetland talks about one resolves the crisis in the benefit of the capitalist class and imperialism that is the one advocated by guaidó in his plan país with the backing of the us it involves privatising state owned companies opening up the public sector to private capital and above all opening up the oil industry which is what john bolton demanded this would mean making the poor and workers pay the full price of the crisis that is the opposition s programme and it certainly does not give any weight to the voices of the popular classes the other solution would be based on pursuing genuine revolutionary policies in the benefit of the majority a return to the tasks that chavez announced but left unfinished a socialist economy and a communal state a socialist economy would require the expropriation of the multinationals and the main capitalist groups in venezuela as well as the latifundia in order to create a democratic plan of production under workers control to satisfy the needs of the majority a communal state would imply putting power in the hands of workers committees peasant committees and neighbourhood councils so that the people can rule hetland seems to perceive only a handful of actors in venezuela the us the far right opposition a mythical democratic opposition and the maduro government however there is also a chavista revolutionary movement which is not the same as the government this can be found in the el maizal in organisations like alexis vive in the few remaining experiences of workers control and in the tens of thousands of poor and working class venezuelans who have come out in the last few weeks to oppose imperialist intervention but you will not find it in the pages of the mass media in the us they are in different degrees critical of the maduro government as a whole or at least of some of its worst aspects corruption bureaucracy etc but they know full well that the coming to power of guaidó on the back of an imperialist intervention would be a major disaster what progressives in the us should do is first and foremost oppose the imperialist policies of their government including sanctions and military intervention this should be done not just through writing articles but by organising a mass campaign in the streets and a mass education campaign amongst students and workers that campaign must distance itself from and challenge the main premises that imperialism is using to justify its intervention it does not mean suspending criticism of the maduro government but that criticism should be made from the point of view of the interests of venezuelan workers and peasants not with a view to pleasing liberal academics in the usa of course such a campaign needs to offer an analysis of what has gone wrong in venezuela but that analysis needs to be firmly based on a class perspective not on the utopian idea that eu brokered talks can somehow resolve the conflict between the interests of the venezuelan workers and poor and those of the oligarchy and imperialism source www marxist com who s to blame for the crisis in venezuela can it be solved through negotiations a response to gabriel

canadians can expect to hear arguments that years of deficit spending have put the economy on stronger footing finance minister bill morneau has promised the budget will contain help for workers in need of skills training young people looking to buy their first homes seniors worried about their own finances and patients with high drug costs it s an election budget there s been a tendency to use these as important communications vehicles almost platform launching vehicles kevin page canada s former parliamentary budget officer said in reference to recent budgets from federal and multiple provincial governments federal finance minister bill morneau holds a media availability in toronto on thursday february 28 2019 when the liberals release the book end budget to their mandate canadians should expect to hear arguments that years of deficit spending have put the economy on stronger footing the canadian press frank gunn the likelihood that the liberals will use the budget to sell their own record raises a question who deserves credit for canada s strong economic run job creation numbers have been solid and the unemployment rate has fallen close to a 40 year low a recent statistics canada report said in 2017 fewer canadians were living under the official poverty line than at any time in the last decade the agency credited the drop to a mix of a stronger economy and the liberals enhancement of child benefits canada rode a long stretch of impressive economic growth until the final three months of 2018 before it abruptly decelerated and nearly stalled along with a drop in oil prices experts predict the economy will regain its momentum over the coming months but even with a surprisingly weak end to 2018 ottawa s financial situation is better than last november s fall fiscal update projected experts say the federal treasury pulled in more tax revenues than anticipated many fully expect the liberals to dedicate the bulk of the extra money to new promises as they ve done with windfalls in past budgets and economic statements over the last few years the liberals have spent billions more than they promised in their 2015 election platform they vowed to post annual deficits of no more than 10 billion and to return to balance by 2019 instead they ve posted shortfalls of more than 18 billion in each of the last two years and have offered no timeline to balance the budget in their november update the liberals projected annual deficits of between 18 1 billion and 19 billion over the next three years morneau has regularly argued that the liberal plan is working our government has made smart and responsible investments in the middle class and canadians are seeing concrete results morneau told the house of commons last month as he announced the budget date morneau has argued the bigger ticket commitments in areas such as child benefits and infrastructure have been necessary to juice the economy for years to come he s also insisted the deficits remain small enough that they re fiscally prudent page expects the liberals to take credit for the economic improvements and he thinks they deserve some recognition particularly for enhancing child benefits and an ambitious expensive infrastructure plan despite its slow start but he added canada s prospects have also been lifted by strong economic performances in the united states and the world as a whole page said it s difficult to know whether the liberal deficits will actually raise canada s long term growth or if they ve mostly created a big temporary bump in consumer spending as the government has borrowed money and put it into canadians pockets winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement you don t have to be at balance there s nothing perfect about a zero deficit number in this environment said page who now heads the institute of fiscal studies and democracy think tank at the university of ottawa having said that we are adding to the stock of debt and that creates potential instability down the road and we ll have less room to manoeuvre and future generations definitely are going to pay higher interest costs on the public debt the opposition conservatives some economists and leaders in corporate canada have criticized the liberal deficits especially because they ve come during good economic times that are traditionally thought to be when governments should pay debt off my concern is and i ve said this to him privately and publicly it s not that you re spending it s where you re spending goldy hyder ceo of the business council of canada said of his exchanges with morneau you re spending a lot on things that no one can really point to and can say there s a direct line back to helping the economy hyder said he supported morneau s move last fall to use some fiscal space for new accelerated investment write offs for businesses he also applauds the liberals commitment to invest in worker training in tuesday s budget and their earlier efforts on trade immigration and child benefits but he insists there s an urgent need for canada to be more competitive on regulations and taxes if it hopes to avoid falling behind the rest of the world
jon pritchett and brett kittredge guest columnists far too many candidates for office republicans and democrats believe long term prosperity can be achieved from increased government spending and centralized programs and plans but the evidence doesn t support such claims no matter how passionately or eloquently the campaigner insists if prosperity is our goal we should follow the lead of high growth low tax states in the southeast that have lower taxes lighter licensure and regulatory burdens and a more limited government what does that look like there are several policy proposals that we would encourage any candidate for governor lieutenant governor or the legislature to support eliminate burdensome licenses burdensome regulations hurt our economy and reduce employment opportunities all totaled there are 66 low to middle income occupations that are licensed in mississippi according to the institute for justice mississippi has lost 13 000 jobs because of occupational licensing and the state has suffered an economic value loss of 37 million while licenses are necessary for a few industries the state should expand the use of voluntary certifications adopt automatic sunsets on all licenses and allow the occupational licensing review commission to review current not just newly proposed licenses the reality is that we ve allowed occupational licenses to become the tool for market incumbents with lobbying apparatus to build moats around monopolies and limit free market completion expand education scholarship account program mississippi became a national leader in 2015 in implementing an esa program through this program families are allowed to use the funds associated with their child s education i e their tax dollars to choose the best educational setting for their child for the first time families in mississippi albeit a limited number of families had a choice in their child s education regardless of their income yet the program is only available to students with special needs and it serves less than 500 students per year we should make this program available to every student in the state by doing so we d be following the overwhelming empirical data that shows the benefits of school choice saving taxpayer dollars and putting parents back in control of their child s education cut red tape mississippi has more than 117 000 regulatory restrictions in the state rulebook according to new analysis from the mercatus center why is this a cause for concern there is considerable evidence that regulations slow economic growth and have a negative impact on investment productivity wages and overall prosperity to reduce red tape mississippi should implement a regulatory cap that orders the removal of two olds rules each time a new one is added a thriving economy is one with fewer regulations a lighter government touch and more freedom for small and mid sized businesses support the innovative economy when ridesharing companies entered the market a few years ago as disruptors to the taxi monopoly the unfortunate response from local governments was largely to regulate and limit the ridesharing economy the legislature made the correct move in enacting statewide policy that preempts local regulation and allows uber lyft and others to provide this new service to customers when it comes to other disruptors such as airbnb or mobile food trucks local governments are again working to protect the status quo and limit market driven innovation the state through the legislature should protect consumer choice and ensure that local governments cannot stifle competition provide incentives to all businesses by lowering taxes mississippi like many other states has taken the approach that the only way to attract businesses to the state is by offering targeted taxpayer incentives rather than offering tax breaks to a few allowing the government to play favorites and requiring business owners to subsidize their competition we should lower the tax rates on all businesses and make mississippi the most attractive state for businesses of all sizes and types do not expand medicaid despite the claim of expansion advocates there is no pile of money sitting around that states are leaving on the table when they choose not to expand medicaid the fact is that any expansion adds to our federal debt and will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars medicaid is already a broken system adding more patients to the system will exacerbate things and the patient outcomes will only worsen the poor quality of care currently being provided to the elderly disabled and poor furthermore an expansion of medicaid will certainly crowd out the essential funding needs for schools roads and public safety we believe these policy proposals represent the path to long term sustainable economic growth based on the evidence public policies of economic freedom individual liberty free markets and limited government will allow the state to experience business growth entrepreneurship higher labor productivity and wages and as a result greater economic prosperity for all mississippians who are ready and willing to prosper jon pritchett is president

sk innovation broke ground tuesday on a sprawling factory that will supply batteries for electric vehicles a venture expected to bring 2 000 jobs to jackson county northeast of atlanta the largest economic development deal in georgia since kia motors a decade ago the company part of a south korean conglomerate known as sk group said the nearly 1 7 billion factory will open in phases and should reach its full jobs potential by 2025 the project is a coup for georgia officials said adding that the facility will be on the leading edge of the electrification of automobiles the new factory is expected to produce enough batteries to power 250 000 electric vehicles or evs per year at full capacity the sun belt continues to grow as a hub of automotive production but the plant also will come with a price with tax credits and other incentives likely to rise into the tens of millions of dollars or more though the state did not immediately provide sk s incentive agreement sk said the plant will initially supply batteries for volkswagen electric vehicles to be made in chattanooga the plant to rise along i 85 in commerce about 65 miles northeast of downtown atlanta will have a production capacity of 10 gigawatts a measurement that denotes the total power capacity of the batteries expected to be produced each year the site can accommodate a facility to produce 50 gigawatts worth of batteries or five times the production of the project s first two phases a company official said volkswagen is doing business in tennessee alabama is home to companies like mercedes benz parent company daimler and hyundai jun kim president and ceo of sk innovation said monday south carolina also has facilities for daimler volvo and bmw and there is kia motor co in georgia as well slightly up north there are other companies like ford this is where the demand is concentrated gov brian kemp hailed the ground breaking saying the factory will create jobs in northeast georgia that will keep locals in their communities it s not only an exciting day for all of us here but it s an exciting day for all hardworking georgians out there for the opportunities they ll see in the future he said sk announced its planned factory in november during the closing weeks of former gov nathan deal s second term georgia lost its domestic automotive plants when ford closed its hapeville assembly plant in 2006 and general motors shuttered its doraville factory in 2008 but in 2009 kia helped fill the hole opening a 1 2 billion factory in west point where the company now makes sorento and telluride suvs and optima sedans the state also has landed many auto parts suppliers as companies seek to gain a supply chain and production foothold in the world s second largest automotive market and to temper the ups and downs of global trade southern rivals including south carolina tennessee and alabama boast more automotive manufacturing centers but georgia is the north american headquarters for luxury brands porsche and mercedes benz more than 27 800 georgians work in the automotive industry according to the state department of economic development from an economic development standpoint we care about the number of jobs created and the compensation these jobs have and so it doesn t have to be the final product for it to be a major win said roger tutterow an economist at kennesaw state university even if the batteries produced here end up leaving georgia and go into final production of vehicles in surrounding states it s really somewhat irrelevant in terms of how meaningful it is for the georgia economy jobs in manufacturing tend to beget others as manufacturers require vendors nearby the jobs also tend to lift people in different socioeconomic strata tutterow said more than 17 million new cars and trucks were sold in the u s in 2018 but only about 2 percent were evs said matthew delorenzo senior managing editor of automotive website kelley blue book still automakers are pushing aggressive plans to electrify their fleets to meet fuel economy and emissions standards in the u s and strict ev mandates in china and the european union sk customer volkswagen group announced a 50 billion global ev investment program last year with chattanooga as its north american manufacturing center regulatory considerations are driving the battery demand more than consumer preferences delorenzo said costs to make evs remain higher than conventional gas vehicles though ev prices are coming down until that cost curve is bent down substantially i don t see natural demand matching what the manufacturers are gearing up to produce he said still if manufacturers can deliver cost competitive evs that become popular those investments will likely pay off delorenzo said kim said by 2030 he expects about one third of new car sales in the u s to be electric i am confident that georgia will be the center of the battery industry for electric vehicles in the world sk group executive vice chairman jaewon chey said representatives of automakers including bmw ford and volkswagen attended tuesday s event the announcement and sk s commencement of construction come as the united states under president donald trump has enacted tariffs on foreign automobiles and vehicle components the trump administration has generally tried to push foreign companies to do more of their business in the united states and for foreign countries to buy more u s goods the u s is negotiating trade deals with china and an overhaul of the north american free trade agreement between the u s canada and mexico the results have been decidedly mixed the trade deficit with china for instance a key yardstick trump has used to measure the fairness of global commerce has grown in china s favor to record levels the exact opposite effect as intended but as many economists predicted but in a sign of the importance of the sk facility u s secretary of commerce wilbur ross attended tuesday s ground breaking he said the project is evidence that our plan to make the united states the best place in the world to invest is working south korea is the united states sixth biggest trading partner with bilateral trade in 2018 at 131 billion which ross said was the highest ever korean companies have at least 75 facilities in georgia employing more than 10 000 in georgia ross said asked in an interview whether u s trade policies under trump motivated the decision to build a u s factory kim said that the driving factors were primarily the need for automakers to source batteries within the u s and automakers push to electrify their fleets
