collectively the group is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends and an attractive total return while limiting downside risk through the origination execution acquisition and servicing of a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk exposure is expected to represent the majority of the company s portfolio outside of the uk investment in the european union s internal market will mainly be focussed on northern and southern europe northern european markets include germany france scandinavia netherlands belgium poland switzerland ireland slovakia and the czech republic southern european markets include italy and spain the company may however originate investments in other countries in the european union s internal market to the extent that it identifies attractive investment opportunities on a risk adjusted basis the company will not invest more than 50 per cent of the company s nav calculated at the time of investment in any single country save in relation to the uk where there shall be no such limit when and if the uk ceases to be a member of the european union or in the event that any other member state ceases to be a member of the european union s internal market it will not automatically cease to be

will be limited to 20 per cent of nav in any event hedging the company will not enter into derivative transactions for purely speculative purposes however the company s investments will typically be made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques particularly to the extent the underlying investments are floating rate loans which are not fully hedged at the borrower level by way of floating to fixed rate swap cap or other instrument any instruments chosen may seek on the one hand to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of and returns on some of the company s assets and on the other hand help the company achieve its risk management objectives the company may seek to hedge its entitlement under any loan investment to receive floating rate interest cash strategy cash held by the company

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6 5 pence per ordinary share the group s nav for the year remained stable and nav total return including dividends was 7 0 per cent the company s share price total return across the financial year was 1 0 per cent downward reflecting weaker equity market sentiment generally across several asset classes in late 2018 as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused liquidity facilities of gbp73 million available to fund undrawn commitments and new lending the gross annualised levered total return of the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent the net asset value nav was gbp385 0 million being 102 66 pence per ordinary share the table below shows the loan commitment and repayment profile over the last five years 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 new loans to

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

2018 the group has applied ifrs 9 retrospectively which did not result in a change to the classification or measurement of financial instruments a detailed description of ifrs 9 adoption is provided in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

statement performance a review of performance is contained in the investment highlights and portfolio review sections of the investment manager s report a number of performance measures are considered by the board the investment manager and investment adviser in assessing the company s success in achieving its objectives the key performance indicators kpis used are established industry measures to show the progress and performance of the group and are as follows the portfolio yield both levered and unlevered the payment of targeted dividends the movement in nav per ordinary share the movement in share price and the discount premium to nav ongoing charges as a percentage of undiluted nav and weighted average loan to value for the portfolio details of the kpis are shown in financial highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical split going forward investment manager s report portfolio review investment deployment as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million sterling equivalent at year

the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the

companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors

their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated

subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk

and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

in share price and the discount premium to nav ongoing charges as a percentage of undiluted nav and weighted average loan to value for the portfolio details of the kpis are shown in financial highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

incorporated company with a premium listing on the official list and admission to trading on the main market for listed securities of the london stock exchange the company is required to comply with the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors

their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

collectively the group is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends and an attractive total return while limiting downside risk through the origination execution acquisition and servicing of a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk exposure is expected to represent the majority of the company s portfolio outside of the uk investment in the european union s internal market will mainly be focussed on northern and southern europe northern european markets include germany france scandinavia netherlands belgium poland switzerland ireland slovakia and the czech republic southern european markets include italy and spain the company may however originate investments in other countries in the european union s internal market to the extent that it identifies attractive investment opportunities on a risk adjusted basis the company will not invest more than 50 per cent of the company s nav calculated at the time of investment in any single country save in relation to the uk where there shall be no such limit when and if the uk ceases to be a member of the european union or in the event that any other member state ceases to be a member of the european union s internal market it will not automatically cease to be

will be limited to 20 per cent of nav in any event hedging the company will not enter into derivative transactions for purely speculative purposes however the company s investments will typically be made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques particularly to the extent the underlying investments are floating rate loans which are not fully hedged at the borrower level by way of floating to fixed rate swap cap or other instrument any instruments chosen may seek on the one hand to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of and returns on some of the company s assets and on the other hand

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6 5 pence per ordinary share the group s nav for the year remained stable and nav total return including dividends was 7 0 per cent the company s share price total return across the financial year was 1 0 per cent downward reflecting weaker equity market sentiment generally across several asset classes in late 2018 as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

2018 the group has applied ifrs 9 retrospectively which did not result in a change to the classification or measurement of financial instruments a detailed description of ifrs 9 adoption is provided in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

in share price and the discount premium to nav ongoing charges as a percentage of undiluted nav and weighted average loan to value for the portfolio details of the kpis are shown in financial highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

incorporated company with a premium listing on the official list and admission to trading on the main market for listed securities of the london stock exchange the company is required to comply with the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors

their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated

and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk

made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors

their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

collectively the group is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends and an attractive total return while limiting downside risk through the origination execution acquisition and servicing of a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk exposure is expected to represent the majority of the company s portfolio outside of the uk investment in the european union s internal market will mainly be focussed on northern and southern europe northern european markets include germany france scandinavia netherlands belgium poland switzerland ireland slovakia and the czech republic southern european markets include italy and spain the company may however originate investments in other countries in the european union s internal market to the extent that it identifies attractive investment opportunities on a risk adjusted basis the company will not invest more than 50 per cent of the company s nav calculated at the time of investment in any single country save in relation to the uk where there shall be no such limit when and if

will be limited to 20 per cent of nav in any event hedging the company will not enter into derivative transactions for purely speculative purposes however the company s investments will typically be made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques particularly to the extent the underlying investments are floating rate loans which are not fully hedged at the borrower level by way of floating to fixed rate swap cap or other instrument any instruments chosen may seek on the one hand to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of and returns on some of the company s assets and on the other hand

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6 5 pence per ordinary share the group s nav for the year remained stable and nav total return including dividends was 7 0 per cent the company s share price total return across the financial year was 1 0 per cent downward reflecting weaker equity market sentiment generally across several asset classes in late 2018 as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

2018 the group has applied ifrs 9 retrospectively which did not result in a change to the classification or measurement of financial instruments a detailed description of ifrs 9 adoption is provided in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

by the board the investment manager and investment adviser in assessing the company s success in achieving its objectives the key performance indicators kpis used are established industry measures to show the progress and performance of the group and are as follows the portfolio yield both levered and unlevered the payment of targeted dividends the movement in nav per ordinary share the movement in share price and the discount premium to nav ongoing charges as a percentage of undiluted nav and weighted average loan to value for the portfolio details of the kpis are shown in financial highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical split going forward investment manager s report portfolio review investment deployment as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million sterling equivalent at year

the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors section details of the skills more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 10 and experience provided by each director can also be found in their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

bh macro limited annual report and audited financial statements 2018 lei 549300zoff0z2cm87c29 classified regulated information under dtr 6 annex 1 section 2 5 chairman s statement in the year to 31 december 2018 the net asset value nav per us dollar share in the company increased by 14 16 and the nav per sterling share increased by 12 43 the share price total return on a us dollar share was 24 21 over the year and on a sterling share was 18 25 these figures are in marked contrast to the s p500 which declined by 6 24 over the year and the ftse100 by 12 48 the company s nav performance is directly related to the performance of brevan howard master fund limited the master fund into which the company invests substantially all of its assets the past performance of the master fund and the company has shown correlation with market volatility following the financial crisis for quite some time volatility was at an all time low and there were few opportunities for the master fund s macro directional trading focus however in 2018 that finally changed a brief correction at the beginning of the year showed what the master fund can do when volatility returns and the company posted a 2 54 increase in nav per share us dollar shares and 2 36 sterling shares in january 2018 in may the master fund produced its largest monthly return in several years and the company s nav per share increased by 8 41 us dollar shares and 8 19 sterling shares following significant turbulence in the foreign exchange and fixed interest markets after the surprise formation of a coalition government in italy although the second half of the year did not feature any further spectacular movements performance was consistently positive while both the s p 500 and the ftse 100 indices were falling the company s performance also compares favourably to the hfri macro total index which experienced a decline of 3 99 in 2018 since the federal reserve last hiked rates in december 2018 its position has become increasingly more dovish and as a result there has been less volatility in markets so far this year nav performance of both the company s sterling and us dollar shares has been flat however demand from investors for both classes of share has remained robust and the discount to nav at which the shares traded in 2018 has reduced significantly as part of the tender offer which completed in may 2017 the board committed to hold a discontinuation vote for either class of share if that class traded at an average discount of 8 or more to the monthly nav over the whole of 2018 there were times during the year when it looked as though discontinuation votes would be triggered however following the very strong performance of the company in the first half of the year and as the equity markets stumbled in the second half the board was gratified to see the discounts narrowing substantially as a result the average monthly discount at which the company s shares traded in relation to monthly nav during 2018 was 7 22 for the us dollar class and 7 42 for the sterling class and consequently no discontinuation votes will be held in 2019 as described at the time of the tender offer the following changes to the management agreement and the terms of the company s investment in the master fund will be effective from 1 april 2019 the notice period for termination of the management agreement without cause by either the company or the manager will be reduced from 24 months to three months the company will be permitted to redeem its investment in the master fund to finance share buy backs in addition the company s class closure provisions and annual partial capital return will be reinstated and applicable in respect of the twelve month periods ending on 31 december 2019 and thereafter except that the relevant trigger for the class closure provisions will be an eight per cent discount to the net asset value of the relevant class of shares over the relevant period instead of the previous ten per cent threshold prior to the tender offer the company used share buy backs as one mechanism to reduce the discount at which the shares traded to nav if the discounts at which the company s shares trade to nav were again to widen substantially in the future it would be the board s intention to resume this process during 2018 the manager continued to implement a number of significant changes to its internal structure on the trading side the manager launched a number of separate funds either supporting individual traders or groups of traders who had been managing money for the master fund through its investment into these new funds the master fund continues to access the expertise of these traders this new approach increases the ability of the manager to retain its key traders at a time when the market for such individuals is very competitive the manager also restructured its middle and back office operations into a separately constituted and regulated entity which is now offering its services to select third party clients as well as in respect of the master fund and the other funds managed by the manager against this background the board has continued its regular dialogue with the manager reviewing the master fund s trading strategies and risk exposures and satisfying itself that the manager s analytical trading and risk management capabilities continue to be maintained at a high standard the company and its manager have continued to pursue an active programme for public communication and investor relations there was particular interest from the press following the company s performance in may and the manager and the company s other advisers actively engaged with existing and potential shareholders in the second half of the year up to date performance information is provided through nav data published monthly on a definitive basis and weekly on an estimated basis as well as through monthly risk reports and shareholder reports all these reports and further information about the company are available on its website www bhmacro com which was upgraded during the year the board is independent of the brevan howard group the directors are very closely focused on safeguarding the interests of shareholders and believe that the company observes high standards of corporate governance in early 2018 the board commissioned an external evaluation of its performance which confirmed that the board works in a collegiate harmonious and effective manner although i have been chairman of the company for less than two years i was originally appointed to the board in 2010 and i will not therefore be standing for re election at the annual general meeting in june i am very pleased that colin maltby has agreed to succeed me as chairman the board instigated a recruitment process to identify a new director in early 2019 with the professional assistance of cornforth consulting limited and we anticipate finalising an appointment prior to the company s annual general meeting i have commented before that the board recognises that the performance of the master fund will be important in justifying the future of the company there are now clear signs that investors are focusing closely on the global political and economic uncertainties lying ahead the benign investment environment which has prevailed for a number of years appears finally to have come to an end and the increased volatility arising from this should present further opportunities for the master fund s macro trading strategies the events of the past year support the hypothesis that the company s investment in the master fund provides a listed vehicle whose performance is uncorrelated with other asset classes through the narrowing of the discount in the second half of 2018 shareholders have demonstrated that they find the shares in the company a valuable tool for portfolio diversification and i would like to take this opportunity to

securities and obligations which may be below investment grade bank loans listed and unlisted equities other collective investment schemes currencies commodities futures options warrants swaps and other derivative instruments the underlying philosophy is to construct strategies often contingent in nature with superior risk return profiles whose outcome will often be crystallised by an expected

inefficiencies the company may employ leverage for the purposes of financing share purchases or buy backs satisfying working capital requirements or financing further investment into the master fund

assessed the viability of the company over the period to 31 december 2021 the viability statement covers a period of three years which the directors consider sufficient given the inherent uncertainty of the investment world and the specific risks to which the company is exposed the continuation of the company in its present form is dependent on the management agreement remaining in place the management agreement is currently terminable on two years notice by either party following the implementation of the tender offer and associated structural changes the notice period of the management agreement will reduce to three months with effect from 1 april 2019 to ensure that the company maintains a constructive and informed relationship with the manager the directors meet regularly with the manager to review the master fund s performance and through the management engagement committee they review the company s relationship with the manager and the manager s performance and effectiveness

assets exceed its liabilities by a considerable margin further the majority of the company s most significant expenses being the fees owing to the manager and to the company s administrator fluctuate by reference to the company s investment performance and nav the company is able to meet its expenses by redeeming shares in the master fund as necessary the company s investment performance depends upon the performance of the master fund and the manager as manager of the master fund the directors in assessing the viability of the company pay particular attention to the risks facing the master fund the manager operates a risk management framework which is intended to identify measure monitor report and where appropriate mitigate key risks identified by it or its affiliates in respect of the master fund from 1 april 2019 in the event that there is downward pressure on the company s share prices the company would be able to consider resuming active discount management actions including share buybacks so that as far as possible the share prices would more closely reflect the company s underlying performance such actions should help to mitigate the risk of class closure resolutions being triggered after that date refer to note 8 for details of the company s discount management programme the directors have carried out a robust assessment of the risks and on the assumption that the risks are managed or mitigated in the ways noted above the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of their assessment going concern the directors having considered the principal risks to which the company is exposed which are listed in the director s report and on the assumption that these are managed or mitigated as noted are not aware of any material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt upon the company s ability to continue as a going concern and accordingly consider that it is appropriate that the company continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for these audited financial statements the board the board of directors has

in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 3 to the audited financial statements the financial statements of the master fund for the year ended 31 december 2018 were audited by kpmg cayman who issued an unqualified audit opinion dated 22 march 2019 the audit committee has reviewed the financial statements of the master fund and the accounting policies and determined the fair

control environment in place at the manager and the administrator with the manager providing an international standard on assurance engagements isae 3402 report and the administrator providing a

master fund generated positive returns each quarter across a wide range of strategies with solid contributions from us european and uk interest rate trading together with developed and emerging market fx trading at the start of 2018 the master fund was positioned for an increase in the level of us rates and a steepening of the us yield curve as the market moved towards pricing a greater degree of tightening by the federal reserve these positions generated early gains over this period the master fund also generated gains from short dated basis trading of us interest rates as well as from tactical positioning in uk rates as opportunities in those areas improved in line with the increase in market volatility and uncertainty around the direction of policy rates heading into the italian elections in march the master fund was positioned for an increase in political stress however the market s initially muted response to the elections resulted in small losses for these positions through april and may the market fully repriced the probability of a rate move by the bank of england which eventually elected not to hike interest rates at its may meeting this change in market pricing also created good opportunity for the master fund to profit furthermore as the market started to focus on a series of policy proposals from the incoming italian government levels of stress across european markets increased positions across a variety of european interest rate swap and bond markets as well as fx credit and equity markets generated strong gains as 2018 progressed the directional and yield curve positioning in us interest rates became more tactical with these strategies generating positive returns each quarter us interest rate basis trading also generated positive returns in each quarter during the second half of the year good opportunities for fx trading existed across a broad range of developed and emerging markets resulting in positive returns being generated every month as an example the master fund was able to profit through option volatility strategies from the sharp moves in the turkish lira commentary and outlook 2018 began with a globally synchronised expansion that generated considerable optimism among investors by the end of the year the global outlook had frayed with overall financial returns turning in their worst performance since the crisis in 2008 the us was the best performing major economy driven by easy fiscal policy and accommodative monetary policy the us economy surprised on the upside growing approximately 3 with nearly 2 core personal consumption expenditures inflation in response the federal reserve delivered four rate hikes bringing the top end of the policy range to 2 5 higher us interest rates and the appreciation in the us dollar caused ripples abroad especially in vulnerable emerging market economies with their own idiosyncratic problems like argentina and turkey among the other major economies euro area growth and inflation undershot expectations nevertheless the ecb ended the expansion of its balance sheet political uncertainty in europe remains high dominated by populist movements in various countries and the unresolved brexit negotiations in china and japan growth was uneven and inflation generally disappointed while the monetary and fiscal response was tempered the outlook going forward is considerably more uncertain given the tightening in financial conditions in q4 weaker global growth and policy related headwinds from trade disputes looking forward the crosscurrents in the outlook will probably persist in 2019 making for an unsettled macro environment brevan howard wishes to thank shareholders once again for their continued support brevan howard capital management lp

in before the neoliberal turn the rise of energy finance and the limits to us foreign economic policy simone selva analyses the struggles of various us presidents to maintain america s competitive edge while stimulating domestic growth between the 1960s and the late 1970s this book is a valuable resource for those looking to understand the history of energy finance and its relationship with us democracy writes ayesha umar before the neoliberal turn the rise of energy finance and the limits to us foreign economic policy simone selva palgrave 2018 find this book if we abandon saudi it would be a terrible mistake said us president donald trump making a reference to the kingdom s influence over oil prices while explaining the us government s position regarding the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi i am about to make america great again not going to destroy the economy of our country what trump communicated in this statement is neither new nor unexpected oil has defined the twentieth century including its democracies our lifestyle work and quest for unlimited growth require large amounts of energy and money all derived from oil with this insight selva identifies the often overlooked but equally detrimental role that the extraction distribution and profits of oil played before the neoliberal turn of the late 1970s while reading his work it is obvious that selva does not want his research to simply be part of the rising number of books produced on the influential doctrine of the twentieth century neoliberalism this is why he has not chosen to analyse the influence of the mont pelerin society the pro market governance of the 1970s and 1980s the chicago boys or the financial crisis of 2007 2008 instead he analyses the events that have given rise to neoliberalism especially in the us where foreign economic policy has been restructured since the 1960s despite the public outcry this is discussed in the preface of the book where selva shares his personal history as an academic working as a guest co editor for journal 900 and how he started seeing the influence of oil and petrodollars at work in today s world chapter after chapter selva uses archival material to analyse how in the post war era the us balance of payments plummeted for the first time and drained its gold reserves he asks how us monetary policy not only negatively affected its industrial productivity but also caused capital outflow from the us to the eurodollar market he also explores how the weak dollar in the international monetary market not only caused the bretton woods system to collapse but also gave meteoric ascendency to oil producing countries in global politics image credit pixabay cco before the neoliberal turn is divided into two sections the first deals with the recurrent dilemma of the plummeting balance of payments in the us since the 1950s the second concerns how us foreign economic policies gave rise to energy finance in the 1960s and 1970s selva examines how us presidents from john f kennedy to jimmy carter with the backing of the political and financial elite each tried to tackle the dwindling importance of the us dollar in their own way for example in the 1960s the us authorities raised interest rates on long term financial assets to unsuccessfully curb capital flight to the eurodollar markets other policies included asking for early repayments of outstanding debts from capital surplus european countries and an increase in foreign military sales while stressing cost sharing nato expenditures with european allies unfortunately things did not go as planned instead of restoring the balance of payments what the us instead witnessed was decline in the manufacturing industry and continued depreciation of the us dollar as various countries started trading in a number of currencies to minimise the fluctuation risk moreover selva highlights the crushing effects of the devaluation of the british pound and the impact of the collapse of the gold pool on overseas us military and development assistance commitments after explaining the us economic situation selva moves on to examining how access to oil and petrodollars has become a privilege for both the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec and the us it is in this section that selva s knowledge of the functioning of international finance and the neoliberal ideal market utopia shines as he elucidates the us recycling mechanism for petrodollars namely the selling of us assets to saudi arabia and kuwait and the use of us banks to boost domestic growth for example the gerald ford administration facilitated saudi investment worth 100 million in the tech giant at t ignoring the concerns of the economist arthur burns and congress relating to the opec countries taking over key national industries subsequently kuwait joined hands with the bank of america and chase manhattan and made investments in the us stock and real estate markets at first glance these and other opec direct investments looked profitable giving a boost to the us economy with less detrimental effects on the us dollar especially at a time when saudi arabia and iran began giving long term loans to least developed countries ldcs instead of investing in eurodollars unfortunately the entry of petrodollars in the us economy has only accelerated the neoliberal process including washington s adoption of relaxed lending policies the privatisation of the national industries and an increase in national and international debt leading to the global financial crisis before the neoliberal turn is an ambitious book which makes it a challenging read especially for readers beyond the academy nonetheless the book is relevant across a range of topics for example the discussion in chapters four and five of the us government s simultaneous use of development rhetoric and the institutions of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank to maintain its hegemonic power under the guise of knowledge and technology transfer was of particular interest to me as my research is focused on innovation and regional economic development i found selva s in depth analysis of us finance policies a welcome addition to the scholarship in aiding understanding of the actors who have co created the market for alternative fuels through subsidies mandates and the much hyped knowledge based economy trump has declared it s a very simple equation i m about make america great again our relationship is with the kingdom of saudi arabia selva has underscored the history of this relationship at a time when balancing the budget through the market is a priority by providing a review of us economic policies of the 1960s and 1970s overall before the neoliberal turn is a valuable book for social scientists interested in the history of energy finance and american democracy ayesha umar is a graduate student at the department of social science york university canada she has conducted ethnographic fieldwork among higher education administrators and graduate students in lahore currently her research is focused on bio economy innovation and regional economic development she tweets umaenauman_09 note this review gives the views of the author and not the position of the lse review of books blog or of the london school of economics

a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk

made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate

instrument any instruments chosen may seek on the one hand to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of and returns on some of the company s assets and on the other hand

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6 5 pence per ordinary share the group s nav for the year remained stable and nav total return including dividends was 7 0 per cent the company s share price total return across the financial year was 1 0 per cent downward reflecting weaker equity market sentiment generally across several asset classes in late 2018 as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business review strategic report the strategic report describes the business of the group and details the principal risks and uncertainties associated with its activities objective investment policy and business model the objective and investment policy describes the group s strategy and business model the investment manager is starwood european finance partners limited a company incorporated in guernsey with registered number 55819 and regulated by the guernsey financial services commission the commission the investment manager has appointed starwood capital europe advisers llp the

statement performance a review of performance is contained in the investment highlights and portfolio review sections of the investment manager s report a number of performance measures are considered by the board the investment manager and investment adviser in assessing the company s success in achieving its objectives the key performance indicators kpis used are established industry measures to show the progress and performance of the group and are as follows the portfolio yield both levered and unlevered the payment of targeted dividends the movement in nav per ordinary share the movement in share price and the discount premium to nav ongoing charges as a percentage of undiluted nav and weighted average loan to value for the portfolio details of the kpis are shown in financial highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

incorporated company with a premium listing on the official list and admission to trading on the main market for listed securities of the london stock exchange the company is required to comply with the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors

their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

published tuesday 26 march 2019 print disqus by david chapman money is not an invention of the state it is not the product of a legislative act even the sanction of political authority is not necessary for its existence certain commodities came to be money quite naturally as the result of economic relationships that were independent of the power of the state carl menger economist founder of the austrian school of economics 1840 1921 the job of the federal reserve is to know when to remove the punch bowl at the party under alan greenspan s leadership its motto became let s all get drunk and see what happens it is now the morning after and the world will be dealing with greenspan s hangover for the next several decades elias dawlabani economist consultant public speaker author of memenomics b 1924 i think the fed right now is a much bigger problem than china i think it s i think it s incorrect what they re doing i don t like what they re doing i don t like the 50 billion i don t like what they re doing in terms of interest rates and they re not being accommodative at all and i m doing trade deals and they re great trade deals but the fed is not helping donald trump u s president nov 26 2018 to the wall street journal the creature from jekyll island that is what the federal reserve is known as in some circles the name comes from a book called of course the creature from jekyll island by g edward griffin the book is a favourite of libertarians conservatives and conspiracy theorists because it claims that the fed is the root of all evil given its ability to finance wars spark economic booms and create depressions so what is jekyll island in 1910 a group of old boy american financiers met on jekyll island off the coast of georgia to discuss monetary policy and out of it spawned the legislation that created the central bank the federal reserve despite the name jekyll island is actually a lovely place with white sand beaches and a beautiful landscape triggering the meeting was the concern over a series of financial crises that had befallen the markets the most noteworthy were financial panics that occurred in 1901 1903 and 1907 but before that the u s and the world had gone through what was known as the long depression of 1873 1879 actually the long depression was two deep depressions with the golden age of railroads in the middle there were banking panics in 1873 1884 1890 1893 and 1896 the second depression ran from 1893 to 1897 despite the depressions the period from roughly 1870 to 1900 was known as the gilded age not surprisingly wealth inequality soared during this period the banking panic of 1907 was a financial crisis spread over a 3 week period as the nyse fell about 50 and there were runs on numerous banks and trusts the panic would have been worse except for the intervention of j p morgan who put up huge sums of the banks money to prevent a bigger collapse the key however is that it led to the creation of the federal reserve system with the federal reserve act passed in 1913 the fed is an independent entity it has both private and public sector characteristics it is divided into 12 regional banks that act like private banks to represent the diverse regions of the u s the president and congress approve all members of the federal reserve board of governors the president appoints the federal reserve chair currently jerome powell but the chair reports to congress not to the president that is why the president would have a very difficult time firing the chair of the fed the board is an independent agency and as such its decisions do not have to be approved by either the president or congress other central banks around the world including canada are also independent and they too do not require approval from elected officials the bank of canada is a privately owned crown corporation with all of its shares owned by the minister of finance while the deputy minister of finance sits on the board he does not have a vote the bank of canada does provide reports to parliament the governor of the bank is appointed by the prime minister pm however the position does not report to the pm the fed does not receive funding from congress instead its funds come from its investments acquired as a result of open market operations the federal reserve banks are required to maintain reserve requirements they can borrow from each other at the fed funds rate they can also borrow at the discount window at the discount rate to be a member of the federal reserve system commercial banks must own stock the stock cannot be traded but they are mandated by law to pay the owners of the stock 6 even as all profits must be returned to the u s treasury the commercial banks that are members of the federal reserve system are some of the biggest names in global banking the fed is responsible for monetary policy through three tools open market operations the discount rate and reserve requirements it is responsible for helping to maintain a healthy economy and full employment and to keep inflation in check through open market operations the fed buys and sells securities hence the huge role the fed played in the 2008 financial crisis even as its balance sheet ballooned from 800 billion to 4 5 trillion quantitative easing qe was open market operations on steroids the fed fomc has 12 members seven are appointed governors including the chairman the president of the new york fed with the remaining four coming from the other eleven federal reserve banks on a rotating basis the fomc meets eight times a year the most recent being march 19 20 2019 currently there are two vacancies this past week president trump nominated economist stephen moore to the fed board of governors to fill one of the vacancies moore is an outspoken critic of jerome powell and a close colleague of larry kudlow president trump s economic advisor moore has been an outspoken critic of the fed s interest rate policy assuming he is approved by the senate mr moore would still only be one vote amongst 12 this past week was dominated by the fed the fed surprised many with its dovish report the fed surprised when it stated it had no plans to raise interest rates further in 2019 the fed is concerned about the potential effects of brexit a slowing global economy particularly in the eu japan and china possible collapse of ongoing trade talks with china and even some signs of slowing in the u s recent quarterly gdp numbers bear out signs of a slowing economy existing home sales have been sliding for months although new home sales have been mixed housing starts have also generally been sliding despite a big bump in january we note gdp and existing home sales below u s gdp growth rate quarterly source www tradingeconomics com u s existing home sales source www tradingeconomics com the fed also announced they would end the drawdown of their bonds in september what that means is that quantitative tightening qt will be no more the markets reacted after some hesitation stocks took off gold took off at first but when the u s dollar bounced back gold sold off yields fell and no surprise the 2 10 spread narrowed further see under recession watch spread page 15 the 2 year u s treasury note has been in a downtrend now since peaking last november the 2 year has in some respects been leading the market towards the dovish stance of the fed source www stockcharts com other central banks chimed in their concern about the slowing global economy as well the united kingdom is careening towards a no deal brexit or maybe they will get lucky and get an extension nonetheless theresa may s tenure as pm seems to be slip sliding away no matter what happens brexit is a disaster that the fed is ending its rate hikes came as a surprise because it was only in december 2018 that they suggested two more rate hikes in 2019 now none our suspicion is that fed knows the global economy is headed for a hard landing but they can t say that friday s sharp down day in the stock market was a response to signs of a slowing global economy and that the 10 year japanese government bonds jgbs and the 10 year german bund all went negative as well we note the 3 month treasury bills 10 year u s treasury note spread turned negative while these are negative signs remember we are still early and in the past there were at least 6 months of negative spreads before the economy turned down into a recession the well followed 2 year 10 year spread remains positive but did turn down again this week for the record canada is also slipping as the gdp monthly chart shows below so a potential slowdown is not just limited to the eu japan and china it is spreading in north america as well but these things take time and a reminder that in a slowing economy that s when the accidents occur in the form of a fund going bust a large dealer in trouble or a bank in trouble that could spread a major black swan event is most likely months away but things can change fast a reminder that coming out of the 2008 financial crisis the world embarked on a period of ultra cheap money and a massive provision of liquidity through qe the result was a roaring stock market that may not be finished yet and a world engorged on debt as global debt leaped from roughly 140 trillion in 2008 to 250 trillion today in a financial collapse it is always about debt collapse and no this time is not different in any case we ll always have the creature from jekyll island but will he and the other

new 52 week highs lows source www stockcharts com on thursday stock markets appeared poised to take off as both the s p 500 and the nasdaq leaped to new highs for the current move stock indices were responding positively to the fed s dovish stance of no further rate hikes and the end of qt in september 2019 on friday that was all reversed as a spat of economic numbers from germany in particular were weak brexit appeared headed for the rocks and german and japanese 10 year bonds went negative the result was the dow jones industrials dji fell 460 points 1 8 with a sharp uptick in volatility so what happened with the run to new all time highs it hit a bump time will tell whether this is a fatal bump or merely a forming correction to the sharp run up seen since the lows in december 2018 on the week the s p 500 fell 0 8 the dji was off 1 3 the dow jones transportations djt was hit hard falling 2 5 while the nasdaq dropped 0 6 given that both the s p 500 and the nasdaq hit new highs for the current move friday s action constitutes a reversal day although the highs were made on thursday elsewhere the small cap russell 2000 dropped 3 1 the tsx composite fell 0 3 but the junior tsx venture exchange cdnx put in a positive week gaining 1 6 overseas the brexit challenged ftse 100 fell 0 6 the paris cac 40 was off 0 5 while the german dax dropped 1 2 not so in asia as china s shanghai index ssec gained 2 6 maintaining its recent positive run and the tokyo nikkei dow tkn was up 1 5 the msci world index was off by a small 0 5 so what to make of the reversal of fortune seen on friday expect the volatility to continue into next week and it is probable the indices will fall further there is considerable support for the s p 500 between 2 700 and 2 750 a break below 2 700 while giving off potential sell signals on the daily charts is not necessarily a fatal move of bigger concern would be a break under 2 600 and below 2 450 new lows could loom the break for the s p 500 over 2 825 was supposed to signal a potential move to new all time highs however the breakout was not confirmed by the dji nor the djt the nasdaq broke as well to new highs for this move this divergence has for the moment at least shifted the focus to the downside does this mean the market is finished and we are doomed to crash to new lows no it does not the fact that some spreads went negative and the jgbs and the german bunds turned negative does not signal that a crash is about to occur but it does signal that the first signs of a potential recession are now upon us in the past it has taken more than one reading of negative yields and spreads to suggest an impending recession most likely we are anywhere from three to six months away from that and at this point we are not even guaranteed we ll see a recession if we are correct then this pullback would be a b wave within the context of an abc type move to the upside the a wave may have peaked this past week we note that the up wave from the december 2018 low unfolded in five waves the b wave could take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months to form support zones are noted above but beware a breakdown under 2 450 unsurprisingly the sentiment at the high this past week was about 95 meaning there were few bears about our guess is once this b wave is formed the indices could return to the highs and possibly see new all time highs the c wave this is where we would get a number of non confirmations between the indices and between indicators in the interim fasten your seat belt the next week or two looks a little bumpy support zones are noted above source www stockcharts com here is the s p 500 the dji and the djt note how the s p 500 made new highs but was not confirmed by the dji the djt wasn t even close watch the relationship between the dji and the djt going forward for major divergences source www stockcharts com the nyse advance decline continues to fascinate it ran to new all time highs however it was not confirmed by the s p 500 that remains short of its all time highs the advance decline line turned down this past week with the market what we would like to see is if the markets are headed for a corrective move as the move on friday would seem to indicate then when we go back up again ideally we would see the s p 500 make new highs with the advance decline line failing to make new highs all this remains to be seen a reminder however that the nasdaq advance decline line did not see new all time highs thus it diverged with the nyse advance decline line source www stockcharts com wow a 10 2 drop in just four days for the kbw bank index bkx it is probably no surprise that banking stocks fared the worst with the fed s dovish tone if a recession is coming it also suggests that bankruptcies and delinquencies will rise which in turn puts pressure on the bank s loan portfolio as well thoughts of lower rates also mean lower spreads for the banks the kbw bank index topped way back in february 2007 the recent high in 2018 fell short of the 2007 high we are in a world where debt has accrued exponentially since 2008 and the banks have a lot of it on their books we also note the kbw bank index was down 28 7 at its low in december 2018 that was well above the general markets 19 decline the bank stocks were in a bear market even now they are still down 18 beware the banks for canadian banks we note that the tsx financials tfs fared better than the kbw unlike the kbw the tfs saw its all time high in january 2018 at a level well above its high of 2007 at its worst in december 2018 it was down 17 5 this past week the tfs fell 1 5 nowhere near the hit the kbw took canadian banks are much better capitalized and while they may suffer in a downturn the odds of one of them going under is nil they also regularly increase their dividends source www stockcharts com the materials dominated tsx composite lost a small 0 3 this past week as it has done in the past it will follow the u s markets to the downside the tsx has solid support just below 15 800 and down to 15 300 below 15 200 would spell trouble and likely a severe test of the december low we note the income trust sub index and the real estate sub index moved to new highs this past week and didn t follow the market down other indices that look positive are golds materials and mining source www stockcharts com it has been some time since we showed the tsx venture exchange cdnx the cdnx is made up of roughly 50 junior mining stocks but you would also find health care energy cannabis consumer and other stocks on the exchange the cdnx is up 14 5 so far in 2019 grant you that is after a disastrous year in 2018 when the cdnx fell almost 44 from its january 2018 top many junior mining stocks were down even more with some falling 90 so the current rally is welcomed this may be the beginning of a stealth rally we note the pickup in volume since this rally got underway it has a long way to go there is considerable resistance up to 650 but over 700 the index should perk up remember the cdnx can give off both great gains and great losses after a horrible 2018 the cdnx looks poised to put in even more gains source www stockcharts com bond yields continue to fall in the wake of the dovish tone adopted by the fed in some respects given that the decline in yields got underway last october the bond market has been leading the fed the question now is is the bond market spent and will the fall in the yields will come to a halt the daily rsi indicator has dropped below 30 a level that often signals that a low could form it was last below when the 10 year u s treasury note fell to 2 56 in december if you have been long 10 years above 3 then it might be a time for some profit taking it is possible for the 10 year to fall further but at 2 44 it is hitting a band of resistance from previous declines below 2 30 the 10 year could take a run at the 2017 low of 2 05 the all time low was seen in july 2016 at 1 37 recession watch spread source www stockcharts com with the fall in yields this past week our recession watch spread 10 year treasury note minus the 2 year u s treasury note fell to 13 bp from 16 bp the previous week unlike some others this spread is still not negative it remains above its december low of 11 bp a recession call would come when we see the 2 10 spread turn negative and remain so for at least 3 to 6 months this spread is nowhere near signaling a recession just yet we believe the markets will calm down and realize that their fears are overblown at least for the moment source www stockcharts com the 3 month u s treasury bill and the 10 year u s treasury note spread turned negative this past week that had pundits jumping up and down screaming recession and the stock market tanked 400 points for the record the 3 month 10 year spread turned negative a good year or more before the start of the 2007 2009 recession it first went negative in february 2006 the spread actually bottomed in february 2007 well before the stock market peaked in october 2007 so the pundits screaming is we believe premature source www stockcharts com pundits also screamed about the jgbs turning negative this past week they peaked at about 16 bp back in october 2018 but the jgbs have been in and out of negative now since the beginning of the year although this is the lowest so far at negative 7 bp the jgbs lowest was in july 2016 at negative 29 bp source www stockcharts com the pundits were screaming even louder about the 10 year german bund turning negative it is down sharply from a peak back in january 2018 of about 77 bp this week s low was at negative 2 bp like its japanese counterpart the 10 year bund was negative in 2016 hitting a low of about negative 19 bp at the time some pundits were screaming it was the end of the world not quite the 10 year bund recovered and hit a peak of about 77 bp in january 2018 there have been definitive signs of slowdown in germany as some german economic numbers this past week were not encouraging one of the big concerns was the manufacturing pmi falling to 44 7 in march 2019 a level well below the expectation of a reading of 48 export orders have been falling pmi levels below 50 are considered recessionary the pmi fell below 50 in january 2019 and has remained below that level ever since germany is also trying to engineer a merger between the deeply troubled deutsche bank db and commerzbank germany s second largest bank that would create a banking behemoth considering deutsche bank is already a substantially sized bank but the merger itself has been troubling db is saddled with a large number of italian debts not a good place to be considering the troubles with the italian banking system db also has russian loans and apparently even loans to the trump organization db also has an extremely large derivatives portfolio which could prove troublesome could db collapse it has been mentioned numerous times but its size alone brings considerable attention from both the bundesbank and the ecb source www stlouisfed org in all of the screaming over bonds and spreads turning negative we wonder why the high yield junk bond spread hasn t moved higher maybe the current concern is overblown note how the spread on the high yield junk bonds started moving higher in 2015 well before its peak in 2016 if the rise in spreads follows the path of 2015 2016 then the spread has probably bottomed and should start rising over the next few months we ll keep an eye on this one source www stockcharts com wither the u s dollar we freely admit that the past few weeks have been confusing as to the direction of the us index it looks down but it also looks up but that is the frustration of these type of patterns they are complex and give off all sorts of signals none of which seem to make sense that line at around 95 50 seems to hold it was tested as the index dipped down to a low of 95 17 but then rebounded and is now above 96 once again we note in following elliot wave international www elliotwave com that they too have been fighting trying to make sense of the pattern the best call now is that the us index has made a rather complex abcde type pattern thus forming a b intermediate wave up from the low of february 2018 the a intermediate wave topped out in august 2018 labeled a if this is correct then a c wave up should soon get underway that would take the us index to new highs possibly up to around 100 breakdown points remain at 95 50 and especially at 94 50 the us index closed higher this past week up 0 1 the u s dollar could rise against the euro pound and yen largely because while the u s economy might be weakening its performance is still stronger than the eu japan and the u k this past week the euro fell 0 5 the pound sterling was down 0 6 but the japanese yen gained 1 3 the canadian dollar was weak because of signs of a weakening canadian economy as it fell 0 5 a breakout for the us index above 96 50 would suggest another move above 97 source www stockcharts com if the us index were to rise as we noted that would be negative for gold after rallying from 1 167 to a high of almost 1 350 a correction was to be expected the a wave down took gold to a low of near 1 281 the current rebound is we suspect the b wave the high so far is 1 320 our target zone was 1 320 to 1 330 so it is possible we have topped for the moment the c wave down could take us to 1 250 that would be in line with a rise of the us index to 100 once that wave is complete we believe it would be the e wave of a rather complex abcde type correction that has been ongoing since the top in july 2016 at 1 377 once that low is in expected possibly by may 2019 gold should begin a powerful rally that would take it above 1 400 gold responded positively this past week to the dovish fed but friday s drop in the stock market saw gold only rise a small 4 40 the 1 320 to 1 330 zone is resistance but above 1 330 a push to 1 350 would take place gold breaks under 1 300 we note that platinum continues its amazing run once again it made new highs at 1 576 90 gold should eventually follow platinum to the upside source www cotpricecharts com the commercial cot for gold slipped to 38 this past week from 39 the previous week short open interest rose about 2 000 contracts but long open interest fell around 5 000 contracts the cot is mildly bullish the large speculators cot hedge funds managed futures etc rose to 64 from 62 source www stockcharts com the bottom pattern forming on gold is one of the best we have ever seen it is a very complex pattern and trying to figure it out is not particularly easy the major breakout point remains at around 1 350 but the reality is gold would need to overhaul 1 370 to suggest a move to 1 400 and beyond the pattern suggests potential targets up to 1 775 but first things first we need to complete that corrective move then start our rebound and take out 1 350 and 1 370 before we can even think about 1 400 this all breaks down if gold took out 1 167 on the downside but we highly doubt that would occur source www stockcharts com silver remains in a nice uptrend however our expectation is that silver should follow gold to the downside it would be interesting however if silver held the channel line and fell no further than around 15 15 if 15 15 were to fall then a decline to the 14 30 to 14 50 zone could be underway as with gold we expect this could be final low for silver silver s breakout spot is around 16 a breakout above that zone and especially over 16 50 could suggest a move to 23 50 source www cotpricecharts com the silver commercial cot improved this past week to 38 from 37 that has to be considered minimum movement long open interest rose about 1 000 contracts while short open interest fell about 1 600 contracts as with gold we view this as mildly bullish the large speculators cot fell to 59 from 61 source www stockcharts com gold stocks did well this past week they were up on friday even as the broader stock market fell sharply the tsx gold index tgd rose 2 9 on the week and the gold bugs index hui was up 2 2 the tgd made a zig zag pattern from the low of 147 in september to the high of 201 in february since then the tgd has been in a choppy pattern of down up down up whether the tgd makes a new high here or not is moot the pattern suggests the tgd should eventually fall back once again below 188 50 a decline to trendline support at 170 is possible volume has typically fallen off on this up move if gold and silver were to fall as we suspect the gold stocks should follow to the downside but as with gold and silver we believe it will be a final low and then a powerful rally could get underway source www stockcharts com wti oil rose to a high of 60 39 this past week but on friday it followed the stock market lower we d love to see wti oil rise to the top of the channel near 64 but friday s drop was brought on by thoughts of a slowing economy however we are soon approaching the major driving season as well despite threats opec and russia have not increased production to put pressure on u s shale producers of course it all depends on what is being called the nopec legislation whereby it would allow the u s government to sue the opec cartel it has been said that if that were to happen opec would flood the market with oil pushing down the price of oil that would put pressure on the highly leveraged shale producers if wti oil failed to hit the top of a channel wti oil could be forming an ascending wedge pattern which is bearish it starts to break down under 58 and under 54 a bigger sell off could be underway the energy stocks reacted negatively on friday along with the broader market the xoi breaks down under 1 275 the pattern that has formed appears as a wedge so any bullish expectations are limited chart of the week source www stlouisfed org we have constantly heard from central bank officials and finance officials expressing concern about the level of household debt here in canada the latest figures from q3 show canada s household debt to gdp is 100 7 note you usually hear about it in relation to income but measuring it to gdp is also quite valid that s above the levels seen in the u s before the 2008 financial crisis we also read that 46 of canadians are a mere 200 from insolvency if a household member lost a job the u s household debt to gdp hit a peak of 98 3 in q1 2008 from there it has been downhill and it currently sits at 74 8 in q4 2018 still high but not quite as drastic still it is high and also highly imbalanced as in canada many are merely a job loss away from serious financial trouble source www stlouisfed org corporations have also gorged on debt here is the ratio of corporate debt to gdp note how it has peaked each time before a downturn and not only has it peaked but it did so at increasingly higher levels the late 1980s boom saw it peak at 65 the dot com bubble s peak was also seen at about 65 it went higher for the housing bubble in 2008 with the peak seen in q4 2008 at 72 5 this time it has exceeded all the previous peaks currently at 73 9 in q3 2018 we suspect it is probably higher now nonetheless it is not a positive sign copyright david chapman 2019 technical scoop charts and commentary by david

collectively the group is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends and an attractive total return while limiting downside risk through the origination execution acquisition and servicing of a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6

of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession

manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles

cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves

continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

collectively the group is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends and an attractive total return while limiting downside risk through the origination execution acquisition and servicing of a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk exposure is expected to represent the majority of the company s portfolio outside of the uk investment in the european union s internal market will mainly be focussed on northern and southern europe northern european markets include germany france scandinavia netherlands belgium poland switzerland ireland slovakia and the czech republic southern european markets include italy and spain the company may however originate investments in other countries in the european union s internal market to the extent that it identifies attractive investment opportunities on a risk adjusted basis the company will not invest more than 50 per cent of the company s nav calculated at the time of investment in any single country save in relation to the uk where there shall be no such limit when and if

will be limited to 20 per cent of nav in any event hedging the company will not enter into derivative transactions for purely speculative purposes however the company s investments will typically be made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques particularly to the extent the underlying investments are floating rate loans which are not fully hedged at the borrower level by way of floating to fixed rate swap cap or other instrument any instruments chosen may seek on the one hand to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of and returns on some of the company s assets and on the other hand

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6 5 pence per ordinary share the group s nav for the year remained stable and nav total return including dividends was 7 0 per cent the company s share price total return across the financial year was 1 0 per cent downward reflecting weaker equity market sentiment generally across several asset classes in late 2018 as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i

based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower

repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

incorporated company with a premium listing on the official list and admission to trading on the main market for listed securities of the london stock exchange the company is required to comply with the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors section details of the skills more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 10 and experience provided by each director can also be found in their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and annual report review and approval of any alteration to the group s accounting policies or practices and valuation of investments approval of any alteration to the company s capital structure approval

a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans

may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6

of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession

manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles

cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves

continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

collectively the group is to provide its shareholders with regular dividends and an attractive total return while limiting downside risk through the origination execution acquisition and servicing of a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans which are either floating or fixed rate the company may seek to enhance the returns of selected loan investments through the economic transfer of the most senior portion of such loan investments which may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk exposure is expected to represent the majority of the company s portfolio outside of the uk investment in the european union s internal market will mainly be focussed on northern and southern europe northern european markets include germany france scandinavia netherlands belgium poland switzerland ireland slovakia and the czech republic southern european markets include italy and spain the company may however originate investments in other countries in the european union s internal market to the extent that it identifies attractive investment opportunities on a risk adjusted basis the company will not invest more than 50 per cent of the company s nav calculated at the time of investment in any single country save in relation to the uk where there shall be no such limit when and if

will be limited to 20 per cent of nav in any event hedging the company will not enter into derivative transactions for purely speculative purposes however the company s investments will typically be made in the currency of the country where the underlying real estate assets are located this will largely be in sterling and euros however investments may be considered in other european currencies and the company may implement measures designed to protect the investments against material movements in the exchange rate between sterling being the company s reporting currency and the currency in which certain investments are made the analysis as to whether such measures should be implemented will take into account periodic interest principal distributions or dividends as well as the expected date of realisation of the investment the company may bear a level of currency risk that could otherwise be hedged where it considers that bearing such risk is advisable the company will only enter into hedging contracts such as currency swap agreements futures contracts options and forward currency exchange and other derivative contracts when they are available in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to it the company reserves the right to terminate any hedging arrangement in its absolute discretion the company may but shall not be obliged to engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques particularly to the extent the underlying investments are floating rate loans which are not fully hedged at the borrower level by way of floating to fixed rate swap cap or other instrument any instruments chosen may seek on the one hand to mitigate the economic effect of interest rate changes on the values of and returns on some of the company s assets and on the other hand

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6 5 pence per ordinary share the group s nav for the year remained stable and nav total return including dividends was 7 0 per cent the company s share price total return across the financial year was 1 0 per cent downward reflecting weaker equity market sentiment generally across several asset classes in late 2018 as at 31 december 2018 the group had investments and commitments of gbp477 2 million of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i

based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower

repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession planning the company has no employees and therefore has no disclosures to make in this regard stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 investment manager s report investment highlights the investment manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to demonstrate the level of diversification achieved within that single segment the board does not believe that the group s investments constitute separate operating segments as at 31 december 2018 the

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles investment outlook and market summary 2018 numbers from cushman and wakefield show that the real estate market in london has been resilient despite the uncertainties of brexit preliminary figures revealed a total office take up of 12 1 million square feet which was 3 per cent higher than 2017 and 18 per cent higher than 2016 from an investment point of view total spend reached gbp19 7 billion slightly down on the gbp20 billion from 2017 but above the gbp16 billion of 2016 the latest inrev investment intentions survey shows that the uk is still high up on investors targets with 64 6 per cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves the eu in addition there has been a slight pullback for financing more transitional business plans in london which may present opportunities for lending on good risk adjusted returns uk retail continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

incorporated company with a premium listing on the official list and admission to trading on the main market for listed securities of the london stock exchange the company is required to comply with the principles of the uk corporate governance code dated april 2016 uk code the uk corporate governance code dated july 2018 will apply for the period beginning 1 january 2019 as an aic member the board has also considered the principles and recommendations of the aic code of corporate governance dated july 2016 aic code by reference to the aic corporate governance guide for investment companies aic guide the aic code addresses all the principles set out in the uk code as well as setting out additional principles and recommendations on issues of specific relevance to the company the aic code has been endorsed by the financial reporting council as ensuring investment company boards fully meet their obligations to the uk code and lr 9 8 6 of the listing rules having adopted the aic code with effect from admission 17 december 2012 the board has therefore assessed itself the committees and performance of the directors during the year except as disclosed within the report the board is of the view that throughout the year ended 31 december 2018 the company complied with the recommendations of the aic code and the relevant provisions of the uk code key issues affecting the company s corporate governance responsibilities how they are addressed by the board and application of the aic code are presented below the aic code includes provisions relating to the role of the chief executive executive directors remuneration and the need for an internal audit function which are not considered by the board to be relevant to the company being an externally managed investment company the company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions the guernsey financial services commission finance sector code of corporate governance gfsc code came into force in guernsey on 1 january 2012 and was amended in february 2016 the company is deemed to satisfy the gfsc code provided that it continues to conduct its governance in accordance with the requirements of the uk code chairman appointed to the permanent position of chairman of the board on 22 november 2012 stephen smith is responsible for leading the board in all areas including determination of strategy organising the board s business and ensuring the effectiveness of the board and individual directors he also endeavours to produce an open culture of debate within the board prior to the chairman s appointment a job specification was prepared which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role discussions were undertaken to ensure the chairman was sufficiently aware of the time needed for his role and agreed to upon signature of his letter of appointment other significant business commitments of the chairman were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments and their subsequent changes can be identified in his biography the effectiveness and independence of the chairman is evaluated on an annual basis as part of the board s performance evaluation the management engagement committee chairman is tasked with collating feedback and discussing with the chairman on behalf of the rest of the board as per the company s articles all directors including the chairman must disclose any interest in a transaction that the board and committees will consider to ensure all board decisions are independent the said conflicted director is not entitled to vote in respect of any arrangement connected to the interested party but may be counted in the quorum stephen smith chairman board independence and disclosure the board and chairman confirm that they were selected prior to the company s launch and were able to assume all responsibilities at an early stage independent of the investment manager and investment adviser the board is composed entirely of non executive directors who meet as required without the presence of the investment manager or service providers to scrutinise the achievement of agreed goals and objectives and monitor performance through the audit committee and the management engagement committee they are able to ascertain the integrity of financial information and confirm that all financial controls and risk management systems are robust and analyse the performance of the investment manager and other service providers on a regular basis following the annual performance evaluation it was deemed that the directors had been proven to challenge the investment manager throughout the year under review as minuted and recorded therefore for the purposes of assessing compliance with the aic code the board as a whole considers that each director is independent of the investment manager and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of his independent judgment if required the board is able to access independent professional advice the investment manager is also requested to declare any potential conflicts surrounding votes share dealing and soft commissions on an annual basis to the board to help with the assessment of investments open communication between the investment manager and the board is facilitated by regular board meetings to which the investment manager is invited to attend and update the board on the current status of the company s investments along with ad hoc meetings as required coming to mutual agreement on all decisions it was agreed the board had acted in the best interests of the company to the extent that if deemed appropriate a director would abstain or have his objection noted which would be reflected within the minutes similar to the process outlined above for the appointment of the chairman a job specification was prepared for each directorship which included an assessment of the time commitment anticipated for the role to ensure each director was aware of the time commitment needed for the role the directors other significant business commitments were disclosed to the company prior to appointment to the board and were publicly disclosed in the company s prospectus dated 28 november 2012 any subsequent changes have been declared certain of these commitments can be identified in each director s biography in board of directors section details of the skills more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 10 and experience provided by each director can also be found in their biographies alongside identification of the role each director currently holds in the company the terms and conditions of appointment for non executive directors are outlined in their letters of appointment and are available for inspection by any person at the company s registered office during normal business hours and at the agm for fifteen minutes prior to and during the meeting there is no executive director function in the company all day to day functions are outsourced to external service providers development the board believes that the company s directors should develop their skills and knowledge through participation at relevant courses the chairman is responsible for reviewing and discussing the training and development of each director according to identified needs upon appointment all directors participate in discussions with the chairman and other directors to understand the responsibilities of the directors in addition to the company s business and procedures the company also provides regular opportunities for the directors to obtain a thorough understanding of the company s business by regularly meeting members of the senior management team from the investment manager investment adviser and other service providers both in person and by phone balance of the board and diversity policy it is perceived that the board is well balanced with a wide array of skills experience and knowledge that ensures it functions correctly and that no single director may dominate the board s decisions having three directors appointed ensures that during any transition period there are at least two directors to provide stability the board s position on diversity can be seen in the strategic report all directors currently sit on all the committees with the exception of the chairman who resigned from the audit committee during the year effective 12 november 2018 each director also fills one committee chairmanship post only annual performance evaluation the board s balance is reviewed on a regular basis as part of a performance evaluation review using a pre determined template based on the aic code s provisions as a basis for review the board undertook an evaluation of its performance and in addition an evaluation focusing on individual commitment performance and contribution of each director was conducted the chairman then met with each director to fully understand their views of the company s strengths and to identify potential weaknesses if appropriate new members are proposed to resolve any perceived issues or a resignation is sought following discussions and review of the chairman s evaluation by the other directors the management engagement committee chairman reviewed the chairman s performance training and development needs are identified as part of this process thereby ensuring that all directors are able to discharge their duties effectively given the company s size and the structure of the board no external facilitator or independent third party was used in the performance evaluation re election and board tenure there is currently no nominations committee for the company as it is deemed that the size composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and annual report review and approval of any alteration to the group s accounting policies or practices and valuation of investments approval of any alteration to the company s capital structure approval

a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market investment policy the company invests in a diversified portfolio of real estate debt investments including debt instruments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market whilst investment opportunities in the secondary markets will be considered from time to time the company s predominant focus is to be a direct primary originator of real estate debt investments on the basis that this approach is expected to deliver better pricing structure and execution control and a client facing relationship that may lead to further investment opportunities the company will attempt to limit downside risk by focusing on secured debt with both quality collateral and contractual protection the company anticipates that the typical loan term will be between three and seven years whilst the company retains absolute discretion to make investments for either shorter or longer periods at least 75 per cent of total loans by value will be for a term of seven years or less the company s portfolio is intended to be appropriately diversified by geography real estate sector type loan type and counterparty the company will pursue investments across the commercial real estate debt asset class through senior loans subordinated loans and mezzanine loans bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments the split between senior subordinated and mezzanine loans will be determined by the investment manager in its absolute discretion having regard to the company s target return objectives however it is anticipated that whole loans will comprise approximately 40 50 per cent of the portfolio subordinated and mezzanine loans approximately 40 50 per cent and other loans whether whole loans or subordinated loans between 0 20 per cent including bridge loans selected loan on loan financings and other debt instruments pure development loans will not in aggregate exceed 25 per cent of the company s net asset value nav calculated at the time of investment the company may originate loans

may be by way of syndication sale assignment sub participation or other financing including true sale securitisation to the same maturity as the original loan i e matched funding while retaining a significant proportion as a subordinate investment it is anticipated that where this is undertaken it would generate a positive net interest rate spread and enhance returns for the company it is not anticipated that under current market conditions these techniques will be deployed with respect to any mezzanine or other already subordinated loan investments the proceeds released by such strategies will be available to the company for investment in accordance with the investment policy loan to value ltv the company will typically seek to originate debt where the effective loan to real estate value ratio of any investment is between 60 per cent and 80 per cent at the time of origination or acquisition in exceptional circumstances that justify it the ratio may be increased to an absolute maximum of 85 per cent in any event the company will typically seek to achieve a blended portfolio ltv of no more than 75 per cent based on the initial valuations at the time of loan origination or participation acquisition once fully invested geography the company s portfolio will be originated from the larger and more established real estate markets in the european union s internal market uk

source thomson reuters chairman s statement stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 dear shareholder it is my pleasure to present the annual report and audited consolidated financial statements of starwood european real estate finance limited for the year ended 31 december 2018 overview the group had another successful origination year in 2018 with gbp208 million of new commitments made to borrowers with repayments and amortisation at a more typical level than in 2017 net commitments increased by gbp70 8 million during the year the group declared an aggregate dividend for the year of 6

of which gbp45 5 million was committed but unfunded at the end of the year the average maturity of the group s loan book was 2 8 years the group had net debt of gbp40 6 million leaving unused

markets the origination pipeline is healthy with a number of transactions under review which present attractive risk adjusted returns the group is cautious about raising equity until it is confident that appropriate transactions may be closed in sufficient volume to at least match an underlying repayment trend averaging 35 to 40 per cent of the loan book per annum new loan closings and repayments tend to be irregular and are often dependent on factors outside the group s control though there is a trend towards greater activity pre holidays in easter summer and christmas the group will continue to closely monitor markets and will adjust its capital structure and its appetite for new loans consistent with the availability of suitable investment opportunities share issuance and share price performance the year end share price was 102 pence reflecting a 0 7 per cent discount to nav the company has typically traded at around a 4 to 8 per cent premium in the last few years we believe this recent downward movement is a reflection of general market sentiment particularly towards the end of the year and we note that the share price has moved back to a premium in early 2019 at the last annual general meeting agm the company sought and received authority to disapply pre emption rights on the allotment of equity securities for up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at an extraordinary general meeting egm convened shortly thereafter for a further 10 per cent as at the date of this report this authority has not been utilised the company intends to seek approval to renew these authorities at the upcoming agm and egm as noted above the company is currently gbp40 6 million drawn on its revolving credit facilities of gbp114 million net of cash with gbp45 5 million of commitments unfunded meaning it has approximately gbp28 million of available capacity which is undrawn on its revolving credit facilities absent of any repayments if the net investment in 2019 is at a similar level to 2018 gbp70 8 million then the company would need to issue more than 10 per cent of existing ordinary shares to fund the additional commitments the directors believe that having access to capital within a short time frame is important to maintaining access to attractive investment opportunities while at the same time ensuring that the company does not unnecessarily incur cash drag by raising equity in advance of deployment opportunities which could negatively impact the company s dividend target the directors believe that such access to capital will also have the following benefits for the company and the shareholders to enable the company to pursue larger investment opportunities and hence broaden the range of lending that can be undertaken to enable the company to further increase the diversification of the company s portfolio of investments increasing the size of the company should help to make the company more attractive to a wider investor base having a greater number of shares in issue is likely to provide shareholders with increased secondary market liquidity and the company s fixed running costs would be spread across a larger equity capital base thereby reducing the company s ongoing expenses per share in order to take advantage of such opportunities the directors believe it is appropriate for the company to renew these existing authorities at the forthcoming agm in respect of issuance of up to 10 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue and at a separate egm to be convened for shortly after the agm in respect of issuance of a further 10 per cent any new shares issued will be issued at a minimum issue price equal to the prevailing nav per ordinary share at the time of allotment together with a premium intended to cover the costs and expenses of the relevant issue the explanation of the advantages for the company and its shareholders of granting such authorities is set out in the notice of the agm and in a notice of egm which is intended to be published shortly dividends total dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share were declared in relation to the year ended 31 december 2018 dividend payment amount period declared date per

in note 2 b i of these consolidated financial statements brexit and macro economic outlook the united kingdom s imminent departure from the european union with or without an agreement represents a potential threat to the uk economy as well as wider europe on a cyclical view national economies across europe appear to be heading at best towards lower growth and in some cases towards recession the potential impact of brexit could have a further destabilising effect to some extent the potential impact of an unsatisfactory uk exit from the eu has already been priced into markets and forecasts but significant headwinds could arise should there be an unstructured settlement it is extremely difficult in the circumstances to anticipate the potential impact on markets so your board is keeping a particularly watchful eye on the macro position portfolio outlook the strategy to incrementally grow the overall size of the group to minimise cash drag from repayments and to use the revolving credit facility where appropriate will continue to be our focus during 2019 we anticipate that we will build on the successes of the recent past and the directors remain optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for the group in the year ahead the board will continue to inform you of progress by way of the quarterly fact sheets and investment updates as deals are signed on behalf of the board i would like to close by thanking shareholders for your commitment and i look forward to briefing you on the group s progress later this year stephen smith chairman 25 march 2019 strategic and business

highlights section risk management it is the role of the board to review and manage all risks associated with the group both those impacting the performance and the prospects of the group and those which threaten the ongoing viability it is the role of the board to mitigate these either directly or through the delegation of certain responsibilities to the audit committee and investment manager the board performs a review of a risk matrix at each board meeting the board considers the following principal risks could impact the performance and prospects of the group but do not threaten its ability to continue in operation and meet its liabilities consequently it has put in place mitigation plans to manage those identified risks long term strategic risk the group s targeted returns are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies and consequently the actual rate of return may be materially lower than the targeted returns in addition the pace of investment has in the past and may in the future be slower than expected or the principal on loans may be repaid earlier than anticipated causing the return on affected more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 4 investments to be less than expected furthermore if repayments are not promptly re invested this may result in cash drag which may lower portfolio returns as a result the level of dividends to be paid by the company may fluctuate and there is no guarantee that any such dividends will be paid the shares may therefore trade at a discount to nav per share and shareholders may be unable to realise their investments through the secondary market at nav per share the board monitors the level of premium or discount of share price to nav per share while the directors may seek to mitigate any discount to nav per share through the discount management mechanisms set out in this annual report there can be no guarantee that they will do so or that such mechanisms will be successful please see report of the directors for further information on the discount management mechanisms the investment adviser provides the investment manager and the board with a weekly report on pipeline opportunities which includes an analysis of the strength of the pipeline and the returns available the directors also regularly receive information on the performance of the existing loans including the performance of the underlying assets and the likelihood of any early repayments which may impact returns the board monitors investment strategy and performance on an ongoing basis and regularly reviews the investment objective and investment policy in light of prevailing investor sentiment to ensure the company remains attractive to its shareholders interest rate risk the group is subject to the risk that the loan income and income from the cash and cash equivalents will fluctuate due to movements in interbank rates the loans in place at 31 december 2018 have been structured so that 19 9 per cent of the loans are fixed rate which provides protection from downward interest rate movements to the overall portfolio but also prevents the group from benefitting from any interbank rate rises on these positions in addition whilst the remaining 80 1 per cent is classified as floating 93 7 per cent of these loans are subject to interbank rate floors such that the interest cannot drop below a certain level which offers some protection against downward interest rate risk when reviewing future investments the investment manager will continue to review such opportunities to protect against downward interest rate risk the board considers that the following principal risks could impact both the performance and prospects of the group and could also threaten its ability to continue its operations and meet its liabilities but has identified the mitigating actions in place to manage them foreign exchange risk the majority of the group s investments are euro denominated the group is subject to the risk that the exchange rates move unfavourably and that a foreign exchange losses on the loan principal are incurred and b that interest payments received are lower than anticipated when converted back to sterling and therefore returns are lower than the underwritten returns the group manages this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge the currency risk all non sterling loan principal is hedged back to sterling to the maturity date of the loan interest payments are hedged for the period for which prepayment protection is in place however the risk remains that loans are repaid earlier than anticipated and forward contracts need to be broken early in these circumstances the forward curve may have moved since the forward contracts were placed which can impact the rate received in addition if the loan repays after the prepayment protection interest after the prepayment protected period may be received at a lower rate than anticipated leading to lower returns for that period conversely the rate could have improved and returns may increase as a consequence of the hedging strategy employed as outlined above the group is subject to the risk that it will need to post cash collateral against the mark to market on foreign exchange hedges which could lead to liquidity issues or leave the group unable to hedge new non sterling investments the company had approximately gbp264 8 million of hedged notional exposure with two uk banks at 31 december 2018 converted at 31 december 2018 foreign exchange fx rates as at 31 december 2018 the hedges with one of the counterparties was out of the money in an amount of gbp8 8 million if at any time this mark to market exceeds gbp15 million the company is required to post collateral subject to a minimum transfer amount of gbp1 million this situation is monitored closely however and as at 31 december 2018 the company had sufficient liquidity and credit available on the revolving credit facility to meet any cash collateral requirements market deterioration risk as mentioned earlier brexit might have a destabilising impact on the uk economy and wider european economy as well the group s investments are comprised principally of debt investments in the uk and the wider european union s internal market and it is therefore exposed to economic movements and changes in these markets any deterioration in the global uk or european economy could have a significant adverse effect on the activities of the group and may result in significant loan defaults or impairments in the event of a loan default in the portfolio the group is generally entitled to accelerate the loan and enforce security but the process may be expensive and lengthy and the outcome is dependent on sufficient recoveries being made to repay the borrower s obligations and associated costs some of the investments held would rank behind senior debt tranches for repayment in the event that a borrower defaults with the consequence of greater risk of partial or total loss in addition repayment of loans by the borrower at maturity could be subject to the availability of refinancing options including the availability of senior and subordinated debt and is also subject to the underlying value of the real estate collateral at the date of maturity in mitigation the average weighted loan to value of the portfolio is 64 1 per cent therefore the portfolio should be able to withstand a significant level of deterioration before credit losses are incurred the investment adviser also mitigates the risk of credit losses by undertaking detailed due diligence on each loan whilst the precise scope of due diligence will depend on the proposed investment such diligence will typically include independent valuations building measurement and environmental surveys legal reviews of property title and key leases and where necessary mechanical and engineering surveys accounting and tax reviews and know your customer checks the investment adviser investment manager and board also manage these risks by ensuring a diversification of investments in terms of geography market and type of loan the investment manager and investment adviser operate in accordance with the guidelines investment limits and restrictions policy determined by the board the directors review the portfolio against these guidelines limits and restrictions on a regular basis the investment adviser meets with all borrowers on a regular basis to monitor developments in respect of each loan and reports to the investment manager and the board periodically and on an ad hoc basis where considered necessary the majority of the group s loans are held at amortised cost with only one investment the credit linked notes held at fair value through profit or loss at the reporting period end the performance of each loan is reviewed quarterly by the investment adviser for any indicators of significant increase in credit risk impaired or defaulted loans the investment adviser also provides their assessment of any expected credit loss for each loan advanced the results of the performance review and allowance for expected credit losses are discussed with the investment manager and the board risk of default under the revolving credit facilities the group is subject to the risk that a borrower could be unable or unwilling to meet a commitment that it has entered into with the group as outlined above under market deterioration risk as a consequence of this the group could breach the covenants of its revolving credit facilities and fall into default itself a number of the measures the group takes to mitigate market deterioration risk as outlined above such as portfolio diversification and rigorous due diligence on investments and monitoring of borrowers will also help to protect the group from the risk of default under the revolving credit facility as this is only likely to occur as a consequence of borrower defaults or loan impairments the board regularly reviews the balances drawn under the credit facility against commitments and pipeline and reviews the performance under the agreed covenants the loan covenants are also stress tested to test how robust they are to withstand default of the group s investments assessment of prospects the group s strategy is central to an understanding of its prospects the group s focus is particularly on managing expected repayments in order to minimise any potential for cash drag and continuing to grow the group by sourcing investments with good risk adjusted returns the group s prospects are assessed primarily through its strategic review process which the board participates fully in the directors have assessed the prospect of the group over a period of three years which has been selected because the strategic review covers a three year period and this is also the approximate average remaining loan term the group updates its plan and financial forecasts on a monthly basis and detailed financial forecasts are maintained and reviewed by the board regularly assessment of viability more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 5 although the strategic plan reflects the directors best estimate of the future prospects of the business they have also tested the potential impact on the group of a number of scenarios over and above those included in the plan by quantifying their financial impact these scenarios are based on aspects of the following selected principal risks which are detailed in this strategic report and as described below foreign exchange risk market deterioration risk including impact of brexit and risk of default under the revolving credit facilities these scenarios represent severe but plausible circumstances that the group could experience the scenarios tested included a high level of loan default meaning that the group stopped receiving interest on a substantial part of the portfolio and an analysis of the robustness of the covenants under the revolving credit facility to withstand default of the underlying investments the results of this stress testing showed that the group would be able to withstand a high level of underlying loan default or impairment resulting from either of the risks identified over the period of the financial forecasts viability statement based on the assessment of prospects and viability as set out above the directors confirm they have a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period ending 31 december 2021 which is also the approximate average remaining loan term in connection with the viability statement the board confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity community social employee human rights and environmental issues in carrying out its activities and in its relationship with the community the group aims to conduct itself responsibly ethically and fairly including in relation to social and human rights issues the group has no employees and the board is composed entirely of non executive directors as an investment company the group has no direct impact on the environment however the group believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and ethical factors when selecting and retaining investments board diversity the directors consider that the board is of an appropriate size and that its members have a balance of skills qualifications and experience which are relevant to the company the board supports the recommendations of the davies report and believes in the value and importance of diversity in the boardroom and it continues to consider the recommendations of the davies report which will be a key consideration as part of its succession

manager and investment adviser are both part of the starwood capital group a leading global real estate investment group portfolio statistics the investment manager and the board of the company considers that the group is engaged in a single segment of business being the provision of a diversified portfolio of real estate backed loans the analysis presented in this report is presented to

however the capital and interest during protected periods on all non sterling exposure is hedged back to sterling annualised returns one of the key alternative performance measures of the group is the gross levered return a definition of how this is calculated is included in the alternative performance measures section of this report the levered return on the invested loan portfolio was 8 0 per cent per annum at the end of 31 december 2018 which has increased from 7 7 per cent at 31 december 2017 with the benefit of a few years of normalised repayment activity the group has assessed the impact of the repayments on the quoted annualised return and it is worth noting that the calculation of annualised returns quoted in this report and our quarterly factsheets excludes a number of potential upsides that are not incorporated in the returns figures quoted in the quoted return we amortise all one off fees such as arrangement and exit fees over the contractual life of the loan which is currently at an average of four years for the portfolio however it has been our experience that loans tend to repay after approximately 2 5 years and as such these fees are actually amortised over a shorter period origination fees are excluded from the annualised returns and these are accounted for within the interest line in the consolidated financial statements many loans benefit from prepayment provisions which means that if they are repaid before the end of the protected period additional interest or fees become due as we quote the return based on the contractual life of the loan these returns cannot be forecast in the return the quoted return excludes the benefit of any foreign exchange gains on euro loans we do not forecast this as the loans are often repaid early and the gain may be lower than this once hedge positions are settled the above three possible upsides to quoted return targets are not incorporated in the gross levered yield of 8 0 per cent as they are not guaranteed to occur are difficult to forecast accurately and to incorporate them could overstate the expected return however we expect these to continue to provide an enhancement to the quoted levels of return going forward although the levels of this enhancement may vary depending on when the loans repay versus contractual maturity and prepayment protection as well as the shape of the sterling euro forward curve over the life of the group to date we have experienced on average an enhancement of 0 66 percentage points from prepayments and one off fees when loans repay and for the most recent euro loan originated we are forecasting a pick up of 1 3 percentage points if held to maturity foreign exchange the group continues to recognise unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses relating to investment activity the group has fully hedged the principal of each individual non sterling denominated loan with forward contracts together with interest receipts during the period of prepayment protection if the loans repay at their scheduled repayment date the group would expect that this policy would be effective in protecting against realising fx losses on capital invested however the accounting treatment for the non sterling denominated loans is to value the loan at the foreign exchange rate at the relevant valuation date and to value the hedge based on the market forward rates at the more to follow dow jones newswires march 26 2019 03 05 et 07 05 gmt dj swef annual audited accounts 2018 6 valuation date to the maturity date of the relevant hedge discounted back to present value as a result of this accounting treatment whilst the loan principal is economically fully hedged if held to loan maturity unrealised foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in the accounts during the life of the loan due to changes in the shape of the relevant forward curves for this reason the group disregards unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses when declaring dividends it is important to note that should any of the non sterling denominated loans repay early and the group has no alternative use for the funds repaid and therefore breaks the hedges early foreign exchange gains or losses could be realised at that point the size of this will depend on the shape of the relevant forward curve at the point at which the relevant hedge is broken in general a steeper curve would result in greater gains losses dividend policy the company declared dividends of 6 5 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 3 december 2018 2017 6 5 pence per ordinary share these dividends are recognised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity when declared which is usually within one month after the end of the financial period to which they relate dividends are usually paid within one month of the declaration date the company may pay dividends out of reserves provided that the board of directors is satisfied on reasonable grounds that the company will immediately after payment satisfy the solvency test as defined in the companies guernsey law 2008 as amended and satisfy any other requirement in its memorandum and articles

cent of investors in the survey looking to invest in the uk which is behind only germany at 66 7 per cent overall the commercial real estate lending market still has a high level of liquidity however we have seen a repricing for uk loans by some german lenders who are affected by the uncertainties around how uk loans with be treated for pfandbrief covered bond financing purposes when the uk leaves

continues to fare less well and this is clearly reflected in investment volumes and a lack of appetite from investors and lenders to take on new retail exposure in q4 2018 according to data from cbre research and property data year to date shopping centre transaction volumes stood at gbp878 1 million significantly down from a peak of gbp5 5 billion in 2014 we expect to see a larger number of shopping centres in distress as a result of loan maturities coming due where lenders are keen to be repaid but the owners will find it difficult to find replacement debt or liquidity to sell the property the retail occupational market will continue to be tough in many places and it still appears to be too early to judge where the new equilibrium will settle for retail income in the wider credit markets we have seen widening of spreads during 2018 which accelerated toward the end of the year in cmbs eur aaa and bbb pricing reached a low in q2 2018 of 70 bps and 230 bps respectively but ended the year around 40 bps wider on each while that has added to blended pricing of cmbs financing during the year this is not a huge move and bbb spreads were higher than this as recently as q3 2017 there has been a larger move in the high yield market with the markit itraxx europe crossover index which is made up of the 75 most liquid sub investment grade entities having started the year at 233 bps and ending at 326 bps after similar volumes to 2017 for the first three quarters of the year there was a sharply subdued level of new issuance of leveraged loans and high yield bonds in q4 2018 with only eur18 billion of new issuance versus eur65 billion in q4 2017 one big contrast between the commercial real estate and corporate credit markets is the growth in size of the markets since the global financial crisis the volume of outstanding non financial bbb corporate debt has grown by 181 per cent since 2007 whereas according to the cass business school the total outstanding cre debt in the uk is 35 per cent lower than the 2007 peak in the group s other key markets of spain and ireland growth remains significantly ahead of the rest of europe in dublin there is low vacancy in prime office hotels are running at the top occupancy of all cities in europe and there is a shortage of residential and student stock this year the group has financed the development of new student accommodation in central dublin residential housing in commuter areas and one of the largest investments of the year for the group was a loan made to support the acquisition of an irish hotel in spain unemployment has continued falling and gdp growth remains strong in the madrid market we are seeing a similar pattern in the real estate metrics with a decreasing vacancy rate and rents increasing from a low base as a result at this stage we are able to lend against capital values per square metre which are significantly below the previous peak and which represents a discount to replacement cost across the eight new loans the group made in 2018 seven were in our key target markets of the uk ireland and spain we see these dynamics continuing into 2019 and a similar mix of geographical

composition and structure of the company would mean the process would be inefficient and counter productive the board therefore undertakes a thorough process of reviewing the skill set of the individual directors and proposes new or renewal of current appointments to the board during the year the board took the decision to submit all directors for re election annually going forward mr john whittle mr stephen smith and mr jonathan bridel are therefore submitting themselves for re election at the agm on 15 may 2019 furthermore beginning from the may 2019 agm each director is subject to annual re election the audit committee members and the board confirm that all directors have proven their ability to fulfil all legal responsibilities and to provide effective independent judgment on issues of strategy performance resources and conduct the board therefore has no hesitation in recommending to shareholders that all directors are re elected appointment process as no new director has been appointed since the company s launch and the board believes there is no gap that currently needs to be filled no appointment process has been formalised it is anticipated however that the process will involve identifying gaps and needs in the board s composition then reviewing the skill set of potential candidates for renewal of current appointments all directors except the individual in question are entitled to vote at the meeting similarly no new nominations have been made for the role of chairman or director of the board since prior to launch succession planning the board is mindful of the need to plan for succession and to implement in a constructive fashion that supports and builds on the cohesive board in view of the approaching 9th year anniversary of the company s ipo the retirement process for the existing directors as currently envisaged is anticipated to commence at the agm of the company in may 2020 replacements should be sought approximately six months before each rotation date allowing for a substantive handover period in the directors opinion this would allow the board to ensure that there is depth of knowledge skills and experience and the right individuals are in place to lead the company into the future replacement directors in particular the exact order of retirements might vary subject to the selection of a new chairman which is seen as a critical appointment the board will keep this succession plan under review and monitor its progress with a particular focus on ensuring over time that each new director is equipped with the necessary skills experience and knowledge board and committees board matters reserved for the board include review of the company s overall strategy and business plans approval of the company s half yearly and

pakistan has not budged from its position on all sticking points over the past four months and it is the international monetary fund imf that has shifted its stance said finance minister asad umar on monday while expressing hope that a bailout deal was in sight now pakistan s position has remained unchanged since november last year and it is the imf that has shifted its position said the finance minister while responding to a question during interaction with journalists at the prime minister s office prime minister imran khan umar and energy task force chairman nadeem babar spoke at length about political and economic issues babar said electricity prices would go up further in the next couple of years umar was responding to a question on whether pakistan had accepted imf conditions on all outstanding issues that led to the failure of staff level talks in november last year pakistan and the imf have extraordinarily narrowed down their differences umar said he also spoke about the day the imf s new washington based mission chief to pakistan ernesto ramirez rigo landed in islamabad for first face to face meetings with pakistani authorities during talks in november pakistan s position was that the measures that islamabad was proposing to restore macroeconomic stability were sufficient but the imf s view was that these were not enough said the finance minister he said the basic assessment of the imf was correct about pakistan s economy but it was the pace of these measures that was the cause of disagreement the imf s view was that the economic challenges that the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government faced after coming to power were far worse than the situation in 2008 and 2013 when pakistan had signed imf programmes he said the minister shared that pakistan was not required to take drastic steps as the measures taken in previous months were enough to restore macroeconomic stability however he did not rule out some additional measures including currency depreciation there is a possibility that pakistan and the imf may sign a deal at the end of imf s staff level mission which will arrive in the third week of april said umar discussions would also take place during spring meetings of the imf in washington next month he said pakistan had requested for the imf mission after it faced a financing gap of over 10 billion in the current fiscal year talks between pakistan and the imf broke down late last year due to the imf s demand for a significant increase in interest rate to contain inflation hike in electricity and gas tariffs adoption of a totally free exchange rate regime and ensuring primary fiscal balance since november pakistan has let its currency depreciate significantly and has also increased the interest rate by 1 75 percentage points to 10 25 the market expects another 0 75 percentage point hike in the upcoming monetary policy announcement umar said the government could not erase all the losses in the energy sector at once and it would gradually phase out subsidies he said the overvaluation of the rupee massively damaged the economy adding that the exchange rate was linked with economic fundamentals and as long as there was current account deficit the rupee would keep shedding its value given the high current account deficit the rupee continued to remain under pressure and fell 12 5 against the us dollar in first half of the current fiscal year according to the second quarterly report of the state bank of pakistan sbp pm imran declared on monday the reduction in public debt as a barometer to gauge the success of his government if the pti government managed to reduce the public debt to rs20 trillion from the current rs30 trillion it meant we remained successful said the prime minister however he added that if the public debt crossed rs30 trillion it meant we failed the central bank s second quarter report on the economy stated that the country s gross public debt grew 10 in first half of the current fiscal year which included four months of the pti government the report released on monday stated that by the end of december 2018 the public debt increased to rs27 5 trillion excluding private debt both domestic and external debt in rupee terms recorded a significant increase as their flows almost doubled in first half of the year according to the central bank babar chairman of energy task force said the government would issue new exploration licences for 30 blocks to find gas reserves he said offshore drilling by exxonmobil was hurt by the current security situation adding that there was a possibility that this could be the largest hydrocarbon discovery in asia babar said there were serious issues of gas demand and supply due to article 158 of the constitution three provinces claimed that they had priority right over domestic gas which created pricing issue due to expensive lng imports said babar the task force chairman said in the past five years the pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n government ignored power transmission and distribution networks and focus remained on power generation he said electricity prices for the next two years could go up due to passing on the impact of rs226 billion investment in power generation and rs170 billion idle capacity payments in previous years this would accumulatively result in an increase of rs4 50 per unit but the prime minister refused to do it in one go he added babar said the last pml n government also did not fully fund electricity subsidies that led to non payment of rs157 billion in subsidies by the finance ministry in future the subsidies would be fully reflected in the budget he added he said the pti government was working on reducing the distribution losses hoping to achieve the national electric power regulatory

price deflation a great idea with low probability the debate between those who predict price deflation and those who predict price inflation has been over two closely related issues 1 the likelihood of rising u s federal debt to continue to rise 2 the ability of the federal reserve system to continue to purchase as much of this rising debt as the federal open market committee fomc decides is appropriate the debate is basically over the debt clock vs the money supply statistics some deflationists might argue that the debt question is much broader than federal debt it also includes private debt in response the inflationist argues that the source of the debt is irrelevant for monetary policy since the fed can legally monetize any asset including privately issued debt in the 30 year debate between those forecasters predicting more price inflation 99 99 and those predicting price deflation 0 01 three facts stand out 1 the deflationists have been incorrect every year 2 there is still a tiny niche market for newsletters predicting deflation and approximately three editors have gotten rich by staking out this market 3 those few subscribers who have actually invested for 30 years in terms of deflation have lost most of their wealth this niche newsletter market will continue there is always a market for newsletters predicting the opposite of what most experts predict those same three editors will continue to live well and prosper until either death or alzheimer s brings their publishing careers to a close one of them is a second generation deflationist i heard his father give a speech predicting deflation and recommending 100 of investors money in t bills at the original gold conference in 1967 after having heard the man s utterly preposterous arguments and comparing them with the other speakers case for gold i phoned my parents and told them to invest 90 of their liquid wealth in american double eagle gold coins which they did the next week the british pound was devalued a month later gold went up and continued to go up and my parents made a lot of money those attendees who invested in terms of the deflationist s scenario missed out on a great opportunity today it takes almost 6 000 to buy what 1 000 bought in 1967 use the inflation calculator here still thousands of unsuspecting naive economically illiterate investors say wow this is hot new stuff and send in their subscription money to get a warmed over plate full of the dead man s arguments which are re packaged annually and sold by his son with the same enthusiasm and also the same results the following year price inflation like the little old lady who feeds the slot machine with another quarter even though she has fed it for 50 years without a single win the deflation predictor answers my odds must be getting better after so many failures no they aren t the machine has been rigged by the house never to pay off the casino is owned lock stock and barrel by the federal reserve system what the fed can do and does the federal reserve system is a government created government licensed commercial bank owned monopoly the only thing that the government legally controls is appointments to the board of governors seven members this is why the web sites of the 12 regional federal reserve banks end in org only the board of governors site ends in gov this is why the 12 regional federal reserve banks must pay for postage but the board of governors doesn t the legal independence of the fed was announced by the ninth court of appeals in 1982 federal reserve banks are not federal instrumentalities for purposes of a federal tort claims act but are independent privately owned and locally controlled corporations in light of fact that direct supervision and control of each bank is exercised by board of directors federal reserve banks though heavily regulated are locally controlled by their member banks banks are listed neither as wholly owned government corporations nor as mixed ownership corporations federal reserve banks receive no appropriated funds from congress and the banks are empowered to sue and be sued in their own names lewis v u s 1982 the federal reserve system has two primary tools of monetary policy 1 the sale deflationary or purchase inflationary of assets mainly u s government debt mainly 90 day t bills that serve as legal monetary reserves for american commercial banking 2 control over the legally mandatory ratio of reserves to deposits reserves that commercial banks must put on deposit interest free with the federal reserve unless they hold cash in their vaults reserve requirements for most banks are low about 10 this applies to banks with more than 47 6 million the ratios are lower 3 or 0 for smaller banks so there is not much that the fed can do with respect to altering reserve requirements that is not deflationary i e raising reserve requirements which the fed never does the fed can also set the discount rate the rate at which commercial banks borrow short term money from the fed banks almost never do this because the fed then has the right to do a detailed audit of any banks applying for these subsidized loans instead banks borrow from each other overnight the federal funds market this is governed by the famous federal funds rate which the fed can influence through monetary policy buying or selling assets then what is the fed s operational tool of monetary policy adding buying or subtracting selling from the banking system s legal reserves i e the monetary base the legal basis of the world s money supply is debt i e debt owned by central banks and commercial banks a central bank increases the nation s monetary base merely by adding to its holdings of assets which are composed mainly of government debt certificates and to a much lesser extent in practice gold gold pays no interest government debt does the mindset of central bankers is tied closely to the interest payments received from governments they want to preserve the value of the central bank s asset portfolio but the seven members of the board of governors do not own the central bank or its assets so their primary concern is to provide the american commercial banking system with security against runs against money center banks this is what the senior level rockefeller employed and morgan employed commercial bankers wanted when they met secretly on jekyll island in 1910 to design what became the fed the fed has never let them down no new york city money center bank has ever failed the 6 000 small banks mostly rural that failed in the great depression were forced to sell their assets to larger banks the recipient banks continued to collect interest from the rural debtors the debtors had lost all or most of their deposits when their local banks went bankrupt bankrupt bank rupture what more could bigger banks ask for secondarily central bankers want to preserve the purchasing power of their nation s monetary unit in which government debt is denominated politicians also say they want this so do commercial bankers and they really do the crucial question is at what price what they really want is this general price stability at a discount price they do not want it at these prices 1 an economic depression 2 runs on the banks by depositors 3 the bankruptcy of money center banks 4 an inter bank payments gridlock 5 the abolition of the federal reserve system 6 a return to a market created monetary system so year by year the central banks create new money to buy more government debt certificates the debt sellers then spend this money into circulation prices rise a market for more debt central banking began in the late seventeenth century as a way for the british government to sell its debt at below market interest rates private investors agreed to create an institution that would serve as a lender of last resort provided that the government grant their bank a monopoly which the politicians did in 1694 the central banks of the world have the legal ability to buy assets with their newly created money those asset sellers who receive payment in this newly created money then spend it either on consumer goods or producer goods or loans to people who buy consumer goods or producer goods they do this after they have deposited checks in their bank accounts the fractional reserve process takes over as soon as the first deposit is made with a 10 reserve requirement the banking system creates 900 for every 100 that the central bank creates in order to purchase assets economist murray rothbard has described how the procedure works his is a useful introduction the federal reserve system can create money it can buy all the debt that borrowers are willing to sell at a market price i e the prevailing rate of interest those forecasters i hesitate to use the word economists who have predicted deflation for over three decades have insisted that someday the inverted pyramid of debt will collapse they never say why or how if cousin sam wants to sell a million dollars of debt nothing legally prevents a central bank from buying it if uncle sam wants to sell a billion dollars of debt nothing legally prevents a central bank from buying it there are always people who are willing to issue more debt at some low rate of interest the largest issuer of debt on earth is the government of the united states deflationists argue that the day will come when debtors will not be able to find lenders deflationists do not explain in coherent language why the central banks of this world cannot buy this debt and lots more just like it the deflationist scenario rests on the strange supposition that central banks will not buy debt from insolvent debtors they do not argue that central bankers won t buy this debt they argue that the sellers of debt will use the money to pay off debts the debt pyramid will collapse there is nothing in modern history to indicate why this might be true there is also nothing in monetary theory to indicate why this might be true the deflationists confuse debt paid off by debtors with debt sold by a central bank the first transaction does not shrink the money supply it merely transfers the ownership of money in individual bank accounts the second transaction does shrink the money supply for it shrinks the legal reserves by which banks are allowed to issue new loans if a man who has a bad credit rating cannot get a rollover loan the person or institution that issued the credit is injured it may find that it is holding onto a worthless asset an iou that will not be repaid the owner of the iou will then seek to sell it at a discount there are market institutions that allow the pooling of such high risk debts in american real estate these systems are called fannie mae and freddie mac if they should get into big politically serious trouble there is a market for their debts the federal reserve system the fed does not lend money to the likes of us as individuals it can at any time lend money to the likes of us as pooled groups of debtors those predicting deflation insist that someday somehow central banks will not be able to lend enough money fast enough to keep the fractional reserve banking system from producing bank failures thereby producing a shrinking money supply this assumes that the fed cannot monetize anything it chooses to monetize by buying ownership but sellers who are in a squeeze are happy to sell to anyone who can provide them with enough money to meet their debts such a person exists the legally constituted person known as the federal reserve system a license to print money but the deflationists insist when everyone is in debt over his head there just isn t enough money in the world to fund the debt pyramid they are correct there isn t enough money in the world to fund it but there s more where that came from when it comes to insufficient money in the world central bankers have a solution it is not a zero price solution the solution could lead to the depreciation of the monetary unit to close to zero this has been done in the past in nations that have lost a major war germany and austria 1918 23 hungary 1945 48 but in industrial nations during peacetime this has not taken place booms and busts do take place but not the complete destruction of the monetary unit still over time the erosion of purchasing power continues voters rarely take much notice of this and don t much care they are content to blame rising prices on greedy businessmen they never ask themselves if businessmen are greedy why didn t they raise prices last year why did they wait until this year voters you see are no better informed than congressmen but voters are not paid salaries to recognize fallacious economic arguments congressmen are officially speaking the deflationist argues that at some point a central bank cannot create enough money to save the system from toppling i e to keep the money supply from shrinking yet in over 30 years i have never read an argument that shows why a debtor with a bad credit rating isn t willing to borrow more money if this alone will save him from bankruptcy if the fed will provide fiat money in a crisis there will be millions of debt burdened takers when did bad times ever convince a nation of debtors who are about to be sent to the bankruptcy courts that an offer to roll over their debts at zero interest will not be accepted but what about japan but what about japan ask the deflationists i hear this over and over japan proves that a central bank can create money yet prices fall oh yeah how far have consumer prices fallen in japan since 1992 do you know probably not you know who else assumes that you don t know any newsletter promoter who is selling a subscription based on a prediction of price deflation the st louis federal reserve bank publishes the figures for the major industrial nations japan is listed on the page click through see what you find you will find a statistic that the deflationists are either unaware of or prefer that their subscribers remain unaware of fact in not one year since 1992 has the rate of price deflation in japan fallen by as much as 1 in half of the years japan experienced price inflation in 2004 prices were flat what does this tell us it tells us that the deflationists have neither economic theory nor modern economic history on their side they are really lousy psychologists too in a productive economy consumer prices would fall in a non fractional reserve banking system new gold from the mines might increase the money supply by 1 or 2 new production might increase by 3 so there would be a steady predictable fall in prices think of the production system as if it turned out only computers or other digital goods would we expect to pay higher prices next year of course not we would expect lower prices plus greater chip speed year after year this is what we get how awful wail the deflationists it s the end of the world you say they don t wail this well why not what is wrong with price deflation nothing that i can think of assuming that people have correctly forecasted it and assuming that it is not the result of prior monetary inflation by the banking system what is wrong with this in other words what is wrong with increased production and a stable money supply too many goods chasing too little money price deflation can and does come with monetary inflation i e increases in the supply of gold it can also come with the increase of fiat money here is the wonderful offer made by the free market things may get cheaper despite mild monetary inflation the debt structure created in times of monetary inflation and artificially low interest rates cannot be sustained in the face of reduced monetary inflation bankers fear deflationary depression through runs on the banks this is why central bankers re inflate again in order to repress a recession before it becomes a depression or as the bible says as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly proverbs 26 11 conclusion here is what a deflationist is really saying despite the fact that the federal reserve system is legally authorized to monetize any asset simply by creating digital money to buy the asset debt will soon next year probably be so large that millions of debtors will not be able to repay their interest on time they will also not accept rollover loans at zero interest then when they default the federal reserve system will not be able to create enough digital money to buy up every dime s worth of this newly perceived bad debt the worst debtor on earth is the united states government this government bankrupt will someday simply refuse to sell any more debt to the federal reserve system all creditors who hold u s government debt will then refuse to sell this now worthless debt to the fed even though the fed offers them cash on the barrelhead for their now worthless debt certificates to which i reply what have these people been smoking ___________________________ published on january 4 2006 the original is here here is a graph of the

seized control over brexit to vote on alternatives on wednesday the uk parliament seized control over brexit from the government after passing a cross party amendment by 329 to 302 late monday the amendment was tabled by former tory minister oliver letwin involving labour s hilary benn it gives mps a series of votes on alternatives to prime minister theresa may s brexit deal including a second referendum staying the the customs union no deal and even revoking article 50 three conservative ministers resigned from the government to support the amendment including foreign affairs minister alistair burt health minister steve brine and business minister richard harrington a total of 29 conservatives rebelled to vote for the amendment the brexit department issued a quick email statement after the vote it criticized that the results upends the balance between our democratic institutions and sets a dangerous unpredictable precedent for the future and it warned that while it is now up to parliament to set out next steps in respect of this amendment the government will continue to call for realism any options considered must be deliverable in negotiations with the eu earlier in the day before the vote may declined to commit to abide by the outcome of the indicative votes she said no government could give a blank cheque to commit to an outcome without knowing what it is so i cannot commit the government to delivering the outcome of any votes held by this house but i do commit to engaging constructively with this process fed rosengren balance runoff didn t cause q4 market turbulence boston fed president eric rosengren defended against claims that fed s balance sheet run off caused financial markets turbulence during last q4 he said concerns about the international economy potential trade disputes and a u s government shutdown are much more plausible explanations rosengren pointed out that the balance reduction is still quite gradual meanwhile equity markets experienced a substantial recovery in the first two months this year even though the runoff was slightly faster than in q4 also as fed purchased long term securities it encouraged investors to big up the price and lower rates on other higher duration securities thus there was spillover to a wide array of other asset prices with quantitative tightening treasury yields and term premia would move higher but back in december treasury rate indeed feel and term premium remained quit low that shouldn t be the reaction to the balance sheet runoff looking forward rosengren said it s unrealistic to expect the federal reserve s balance sheet to return to the size it was before the financial crisis meanwhile in a hypothetical next recession central banks will have little room to reduce short term rates thus there will be increased need to utilize the balance sheet as stimulative tool of monetary policy canada freeland illegal us 232 steel tariffs should be removed to move ahead with usmca after meeting with us trade representative robert lighthizer in washington yesterday canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland warned that the us steel tariffs raised serious questions on support for ratification of the new nafta now known as usmca she said the existence of these tariffs for many canadians raises some serious questions about nafta ratification and in order to move ahead with that deal i think canadians feel the right thing is there should be no 232 tariffs or retaliatory tariffs between our two countries freeland raised the issue to lighthizer clearly and emphasized these tariffs are completely unacceptable to canada repeating the words illegal unjustified and absurd several times in describing them boj opinions downside risks to economy clearly heightening recently in the summary of opinions at the march 14 15 monetary policy meeting boj noted that while uncertainties regarding overseas economies started to become apparent from around last autumn slowdowns have materialized and reflecting these developments downside risks to japan s economy clearly have been heightening recently also it is concerning that developments toward an economic downturn could heighten depending on developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike on monetary policy boj maintained that it should persistently continue with the current monetary policy stance but it also emphasized that in case developments in economic activity and prices undergo a phase shift it is important to make preemptive policy responses rba ellis nexus between labor households and housing are crucial to economic outlook assessment rba assistant governor luci ellis said in a speech that the disconnect between apparently weak national accounts and noticeably stronger labor market data can be traced to the household sector in contrast to the positive picture implied by the labor markets she noted that growth in household income has been slow besides growth in consumption has weakened recently while there were talks of wealth effects from fall in house prices on spending ellis noted that the link is a bit more subtle than simply that rise in wealth boost spending directly at the same time fundamentally demand for housing rests on the household sector s confidence and capacity to take on the financial commitments involved in the purchase or rental of a home without enough income and so without a strong labour market that confidence and capacity would be in doubt ellis emphasized that the nexus between labour markets

overview the sell off in equities seemed to peak yesterday and us indices were narrowly mixed traders found comfort in that performance even though the s p 500 finished a little below 2800 and took the markets in the asia pacific region higher except in china where the shanghai composite fell 1 5 chinese shares saw the most foreign sales over the link with hong kong since the second connect was opened a couple of years ago the nikkei led the asian markets higher with a 2 1 gain that nearly closed the gap created with yesterday s sharply lower opening european bourses are struggling to follow suit and have a four day drop in tow after a dramatic bond market rally over the past few days some profit taking appears to be kicking in and yields in europe and the us and edging higher after the us 10 year yield briefly traded below 2 40 the same level the fed pays on reserves the foreign exchange market is particularly quiet the dollar is slightly firmer against most of the major currencies the australian dollar is the notable exception it is up about 0 2 higher yields and higher equities appear to be weighing on yen with the greenback near jpy110 15 the yen is off about 0 15 making it the weakest through the european morning asia pacific with china s president xi in europe ahead of the summit later this week it is not surprising that new deals are being signed with its hosts yesterday china announced it was buying 35 bln of planes from airbus which includes 290 a320s which compete with boeing s troubled 737 max that has been grounded china s humungous market gives it leverage and some of the technology transfers are not the product of espionage or stealing but given to secure lucrative contracts other contracts were signed but the airbus deal captured the people s attention separately reports suggest that china s imports of us soy jumped nearly seven fold in february over january to almost 908k tons while this is a step in the right direction recall that in february 2018 china bought 3 3 mln tons of soy from the us another big jump in us soy exports to china seems to have taken place this month some estimates suggest as much as 6 5 mln tons of soy may have been shipped china has replaced part of the us shipments with brazil s soy 14 year over year in february and argentina which sold little to china in 2018 new zealand unexpectedly reported a trade surplus in february although seasonal patterns tend to be favorable the nz 12 mln surplus compares with forecasts for an nz 200 mln deficit after a revised nearly nz 950 mln shortfall at the end of 2018 exports firmed while imports slipped but the important takeaway is that on a rolling 12 month basis new zealand s trade deficit reached nz 6 62 bln by this measure the trade deficit has more than doubled since the end of 2017 meanwhile the benchmark 10 year yield is at new record lows near 1 85 samsung warned that sagging memory chip and display prices means it will miss its earnings estimates when it reports on april 5 however it appears the worst may be behind it and dram pricing for march will be reported later this week samsung finished little changed and the kospi eked out a small gain the dollar has been confined to a narrow range against the yen as it continues to straddle the jpy110 00 level firmer yields and equities would take a prop away from the yen today there are options for 1 72 bln struck at jpy110 10 jpy110 15 look for a wider band to prevail jpy109 70 and jpy110 50 in the coming days the australian dollar recovered from near 0 7065 yesterday to nearly 0 7130 today the intraday technicals are consistent with a push to marginal new highs but we suspect it is a better sell in front the of 0 7170 area it approached in response to the dovish fed statement last week at 0 7125 the aussie is in the middle of two expiring options at 0 7100 a 500 mln and 0 7150 a 720 mln europe brexit developments dominate market talk today prime minister may lost a vote yesterday 329 302 that sees the house of commons take near term control of the debate may admitted she does not have the support to bring the withdrawal bill for a third vote tomorrow parliament will debate and vote non binding on alternatives these may include a customs union a second referendum and leaving without an agreement although may s leadership and approach are unlikely to be viewed favorably by history the immediate risk is that parliament is also weak and divided many talk about what was first offered as a non binding referendum that both the conservatives and labour agreed to accept as binding as if it were clear and obvious what the 52 meant when they voted to leave the eu this is not the case returning the issue to the people for clearer instructions may not undermine representative government the most likely scenario at this juncture is for a long extension and this will be underscored if parliament cannot find a majority for any alternative however there may be one more card to play it appears that if may would offer to resign she could still forge a compromise the turkish lira returned to the pre weekend high early today before retreating again the dollar was sold to try5 4750 compare to nearly try5 46 before the big sell off at the end of last week the overnight swap rate jumped over 96 yesterday as foreign holders of lira tried selling it but did not find buyers the dollar has returned to try5 55 by late morning activity in europe the euro has been confined to a fifth of a cent range above 1 13 it is inside yesterday s range which was inside last friday s range yesterday s upside surprise on the german ifo survey has given rise to speculation that a recovery in q2 is increasingly likely resistance is seen in the 1 1340 1 1360 area sterling has slipped marginally through yesterday s lows 1 3160 late in the european morning the 1 3125 1 3150 houses retracement objectives and past congestion and likely offers sufficient support today america there is much consternation over the inversion of the us yield curve the conditions that lead to an inversion of the curve typically are the same that lead to an economic downturn however there are long and variable lag times and many 2 3 economists had already forecast a recession over the next one two years context is important too in the past when the curve has gone inverted the short end is more than twice current levels there are around 10 trillion in negative yielding bonds in europe and asia and the latest leg down in yields seemed to be sparked by the dismal emu flash pmi before the weekend still many argued that it was qe that acted to depress yields clearly something else besides fed and ecb purchases is driving yields lower some fears that unwinding the balance sheet was going to tighten conditions by driving up rates the us 10 year yield peaked at the start of q4 just as the fed s unwind reached terminal velocity of 50 bln a month as the unwind continued the yield fell more than 80 bp through yesterday while the balance sheet operations will be completed by the end of q3 the debate over some of the other issues surrounding the balance sheet are coming to the fore yesterday at least three officials opined about the duration of the balance sheet the average maturity of the fed s portfolio is near eight years while the average maturity of the outstanding treasuries is near 5 8 years rosengren and harker saw advantages in holding a shorter duration portfolio though evans seems to emphasize the risks daly joins harker and evans in public speeches today the highlights for today s economic calendar include us february housing starts some payback is likely for the 18 6 surge in january economists look for a small decline 1 5 january house prices will also be reported mexican retail sales fell 3 2 in december and are expect to have bounced back in january a 2 gain is expected the us dollar peaked yesterday near cad1 3445 higher oil prices and firmer equities may give the canadian dollar a better bid but the two year rate differentials are bouncing back in the us favor look for support near cad1 3250 the mexican peso is trading quietly near yesterday s best levels the us dollar is hovering just above mxn19 00 the dollar index looks trapped between the five day average 96 40 and the 20 day average 96 65
the turkish lira depreciated by more than 5 percent in us dollars terms last friday just nine days before nationwide local elections in which president recep tayyip erdogan and his justice and development party akp are expected to suffer significant losses the lira tl did recoup more than half of friday s losses yesterday after turkey s central bank sharply raised overnight borrowing costs for financial institutions nevertheless friday s sell off points to the vulnerability and mounting crisis of the turkish economy which fell into recession late last year the principal if not the overriding factor in friday s lira depreciation was investor fears of a further deterioration in us turkish relations after erdogan sharply criticized us president trump s march 21 announcement that washington was formally endorsing israel s illegal annexation of the golan heights according to press reports figures showing a sharp drop in turkey s foreign reserves in the first two weeks of march and an imf spokesman s call thursday for ankara to address key imbalances in the economy also contributed to friday s lira sell off us turkish relations have been in freefall since washington made the ypg the syrian offshoot of the kurdish nationalist pkk against which ankara has been waging a bloody war in southeast turkey for the past 35 years its principal proxy army in its regime change war in syria then backed an unsuccessful military coup against erdogan in july 2016 in recent weeks trump administration and pentagon officials have been making ever more explicit threats of retaliatory action against turkey a nato member since 1952 if it proceeds with the purchase of russia s s 400 air defence system last august s doubling of us tariffs on turkish aluminum and steel purportedly in retaliation for turkey s jailing of a us pastor that it claimed was involved in the failed 2016 coup triggered a crash in the value of the lira that continues to roil turkey s economy prices have risen sharply with inflation surpassing 20 percent in january so too have borrowing charges on the many us dollar and euro dominated loans turkish corporations took out in recent years to take advantage of lower interest rates offshore turkey fell into recession for the first time in a decade when its economy contracted 3 percent in the last three months of 2018 analysts are predicting a further 2 4 percent slide in the first quarter of this year the working class is bearing the brunt of the economic crisis turkey s official unemployment rate jumped to 13 5 percent in december 2018 its highest level since the 2008 2009 financial meltdown and global slump the youth jobless rate is 24 5 percent in january almost 3 8 million people were registered with the employment agency of turkey iskur up from 2 4 million in the first month of 2018 workers are also being squeezed by food price rises at 30 97 percent on a year on year basis turkey s food price inflation in january was the second worst in oecd counties trailing only argentina and the seventh worst in the world almost half of turkish workers are paid the minimum wage whose value in us dollar terms has tumbled despite a recent 26 percent increase from 1 603 tl or 424 per month at the beginning of 2018 to 2020 tl or only about 350 today the erdogan government is acutely aware of mounting popular anger over the deteriorating economic situation and the threat it could speak a social explosion its response has been to put off further austerity measures until after the march 31 elections and announce a handful of populist programs aimed at mitigating popular anger while intensifying its turn toward authoritarian forms of rule and using nationalist and militarist rhetoric to try to divert social anger along reactionary lines the akp government has set up markets in istanbul and ankara respectively turkey s largest and second largest cities to sell vegetables and fruits at half the market price in both cities akp led administrations are facing a strong opposition challenge in next sunday s municipal elections the government has also announced a new employment campaign under which it is promising to pay wages taxes and social charges for new hires for their first three months on the job erdogan is posturing as the defender of the people against price gouging he has accused the supermarkets of usury and exploitation and said their actions are akin to treason even terrorism in february the government even made a show of ordering raids on wholesale food markets in reality the akp has relentlessly pursued neo liberal policies including wholesale privatizations since coming to power in 2002 many of its pro investor policies including subsidy cuts have adversely impacted small farmers and strengthened domestic and foreign agribusiness directly contributing to the food price rises erdogan has also tried to shift attention from his own government s responsibility for the economic crisis with demagogic denunciations of us and european bullying and bellicose attacks on the pkk and ypg in a speech at an election rally in the central city of sivas erdogan accused the population of whining about food prices when they should instead be concerned with the price of bullets and soldiers uniforms for the battle against the pkk all this talk about tomatoes eggplants and green peppers fumed erdogan do you have any idea how much a bullet costs think about the cost of getting our soldiers ready to fight terrorists and here you are talking about tomatoes and potatoes some people are complicit he continued while george and hans a reference to the us and germany are trying to hit us tuncay ozilhan a billionaire and leader of turkey s most powerful business organization the turkish industry and business association recently criticized erdogan s economic policies saying turkey is now experiencing the consequences of past mistakes in many areas from food inflation to unemployment we continued ozilhan do not think that the steps the government has taken against rising food prices can solve the problem the number of farmers who are responsible for feeding an 80 million population has fallen from 10 percent to 3 percent in a situation where production decreases farming collapses and consumption increases rapidly food price control cannot be a remedy behind these criticisms lie deeper concerns within the ruling class over the growing rift between ankara and the western imperialist powers and the ability of the islamist akp whose string of electoral successes over the past 17 years has been bound up with its ability to muster support from sections of the rural and urban poor to contain mounting social anger as the economic situation goes from bad to worse above all the ruling class fears rampant social inequality soaring prices mass unemployment and the proliferation of precarious contract jobs will cause turkish workers to join the global working class upsurge that has already convulsed france mexico s low wage maquiladora region and has now engulfed algeria in a revolutionary crisis to name just a few of the most prominent examples the principal difference between the akp and the opposition parties is the latter s more pronounced orientation to the turkish bourgeoisie s traditional north american and european imperialist allies both the republican people s party chp the historic party of the kemalist elite that dominated the military and other state institutions of the turkish republic in the last century and the kurdish nationalist pseudo left supported people s democratic party hdp are cynically seeking to exploit the popular anger over the mounting economic crisis while advancing unabashedly pro capitalist programs chp leader kemal kilicdaroglu deplores that turks have been reduced to scrounging for food in trash bins but in the very next breathe says ankara should be focusing on boosting exports i e on boosting the competitive positions turkish capital not borrowing funds to sustain a social state the hdp is supporting the chp in the major cities of western turkey and promoting it as a defender of democracy against akp fascism although the chp has connived in repeated military coups that resulted in savage repression of the working class and has played a pivotal role in supporting the savage decades long war against turkey s kurdish minority the reality is all these parties stand as one against the working class how they will respond to the inevitable eruption of mass working class discontent was indicated last september when thousands of construction workers at the site of a new airport in istanbul carried out protests against workplace accidents precarious and oppressive working conditions and the violation of their basic rights the government answered the mass protest and the workers just demands with a brutal police attack and the jailing of more than 30 militant workers

facility rcf real gdp growth decelerated to 3¼ percent in 2018 but it was broader based with non mining growth accelerating to 2¾ percent in 2018 from 2 percent in 2017 inflation remains subdued reflecting tight monetary policy and exchange rate and food price stability international reserves at the bank of mozambique are relatively comfortable covering over six months of next year s non megaproject imports despite the likely adverse macroeconomic effects of cyclone idai in 2019 which are still being analyzed the outlook is for a recovery in economic activity over the medium term with more significant expansion with the start of lng production expected in 2023 the fiscal policy effort was significant in 2017 18 subsidies on fuel and wheat prices were eliminated an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism was adopted and electricity and public transportation tariffs were adjusted bringing those prices close to cost recovery levels despite these efforts the overall fiscal deficit in 2018 remained relatively high medium term fiscal consolidation will be essential to ensure that public debt to gdp ratios remain on a clear downward path and given that public debt is in distress budget financing should rely to the maximum extent possible on grants and highly concessional loans the mission also emphasizes the importance of achieving significant debt relief and strengthening oversight of the entire public debt portfolio to bring public debt indicators to safer levels the mission welcomes the implementation of the strategy to clear the stock of domestic payments arrears to suppliers and advises the authorities to avoid new arrears by strengthening commitment controls it also encourages the authorities to develop a strategy to clear the backlog of vat refunds the mission welcomes cabinet approval of the soe law regulations and recommends strengthening controls over soe debt issuance the new agency envisaged in the soe law once created should exert strong financial oversight over the entire sector however in this area time is of essence the authorities should speed up the preparation and implementation of recovery restructuring and or privatization plans of soes in distress to limit risks to the budget while the mission supports the drive for fiscal decentralization it recommends a gradual transfer of revenue and spending responsibilities to subnational levels of government in line with their capacity to maintain the quality of delivery of public goods and services it also stresses the importance of implementing fiscal decentralization without increasing overall fiscal deficits given the challenges posed by the elevated level of public debt on the monetary front the mission encourages the bank of mozambique to continue reducing the policy rate albeit cautiously while ensuring that inflation expectations remain well anchored lower real interest rates would help increase bank credit flows to the private sector particularly smes fostering economic activity and job creation as well as financial inclusion it recommends maintaining exchange rate flexibility as a shock absorber and preserving an adequate level of international reserves the mission welcomes the bank of mozambique resolve to enhance supervision enforce prudential requirements and upgrade the regulatory framework to ensure financial stability the mission encourages the authorities to continue taking steps to strengthen governance transparency and accountability it welcomes their ongoing efforts with imf technical assistance to prepare a diagnostic report of governance and corruption challenges in areas most relevant for economic activity the mission strongly recommends publication of this diagnostic report shortly after completion to accelerate inclusive and private sector led growth the mission recommends removing impediments to private sector investments and employment adopting reforms to improve the business climate and strengthening social safety nets we would like to thank the authorities for fruitful discussions and warm hospitality and for the arrangements made to facilitate the mission s work the

for immediate release chicago il march 26 2019 zacks equity research ametek ame as the bull of the day guess ges as the bear of the day in addition zacks equity research provides analysis on anthem antm carlsberg as cabgy and south32 souhy here is a synopsis of all five stocks bull of the day with the market coming under pressure over the last couple of trading sessions it can feel like the best idea is to avoid stocks altogether over the long run that s never the case what you should look for is stocks that have great earnings trends which have suffered due to the temporary retreat in prices essentially what you ll be doing is buying great stocks when they are on sale one such stock is today s bull of the day ametek ametek inc is a leading global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices with annual sales of approximately 5 billion ametek has 18 000 colleagues at more than 150 operating locations and a global network of sales service and support locations in 30 countries around the world currently ametek is a zacks rank 1 strong buy the reason for the favorable zacks rank lies in a series of earnings estimate revisions to the upside over the last thirty days ten analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year while six have hiked their numbers for next year the bullish sentiment has pushed up the zacks consensus estimate for both of those periods current year estimates have gone from 3 61 to 4 04 while next year s numbers have gone from 3 83 to 4 30 it s no wonder that the stock has been on the move since bottoming out under 64 in late december ame shares have rallied over 25 the bulls didn t have the strength to take the stock powering through the 52 week high just north of 82 last friday s selling took the stock back under 80 for the first time since early march the 50 day moving average crossed over the 200 day on march 13th giving the golden cross buy signal the swing low in early march near 78 should provide a nice stop level for those looking to enter long story continues bear of the day after the wholesale retail carnage the market saw several quarters back lots of names emerged from the wreckage stores were adapting their strategies using their brick and mortar locations to present one leg of an omni channel presence in order to breathe life into their brands some retailers did it very well as evident by their earnings others didn t fare nearly as well today s bear of the day is one such retailer that just had a rough quarter they hope to sweep under the rug i m talking about zacks rank 5 strong sell guess guess inc designs markets distributes and licenses lifestyle collections of apparel and accessories for men women and children it operates through five segments americas retail americas wholesale europe asia and licensing the company s clothing collection includes jeans pants skirts dresses shorts blouses shirts jackets knitwear and intimate apparel it also grants licenses to manufacture and distribute various products that complement its apparel lines such as eyewear watches handbags footwear kids and infants apparel outerwear swimwear fragrance jewelry and other fashion accessories last quarter the company reported eps of 70 cents versus expectations calling for 76 cents revenues were a bit light as well coming in at 837 million three million shy of the mark that was the second consecutive miss for the stock this was part of the reason why analysts cut their expectations over the last week analysts have cut their estimates for the current quarter and current year the bearish sentiment has brought the zacks consensus estimate for the current quarter down from a 15 cent loss to a 25 cent loss the current year number has come down from 1 42 to 1 26 helping to put the stock price under pressure where do equities go from here back in january the u s federal reserve fired up investors appetite for risk by pledging to be patient with future rate rises in march it sealed that promise by doubling down on its dovish stance and scaling back projected 2019 interest rate increases to zero the result a 10 percent plus bounce on global stocks in the january march period the s p500 is headed for its best first quarter of any year since 1991 other big q1 winners with dollar based gains close to 30 percent are chinese shares and brent crude what happens next to some the rally in what are inherently risky growth reliant assets makes little sense when the world economy is in slowdown mode and should therefore evaporate but others counter the second quarter will bring more gains they note that despite double digit gains investors have mostly been betting against stocks for most of 2019 investment research firm trimtabs says equity funds have seen outflows of 18 7 billion this year through wednesday they have instead channeled 73 1 billion into bond funds contrarian play european equities despite a strong rally across markets this year european equities remain one of the most disliked regions in the world bank of america merrill lynch s monthly fund manager survey confirmed that view with investors naming short european equities as the most crowded trade for the first time for contrarians that s a gift a sign bearish positioning on europe has got too extreme and stocks should rise from here indeed there are some positive signals from recent macroeconomic data from retail sales to wages that has sparked a quiet rise on citi s index of eurozone macro surprises which now interestingly sits above the equivalent u s index there are also predictions that as china s economy starts benefiting from the stimulus its authorities have unveiled europe too will feel the effect but after every glimmer of hope comes a dampener february pmi data from germany and the eurozone sent markets reeling next up are the ifo business climate survey and consumer confidence figures those should tell us whether it is too early to call a bottom more global monetary policy follow up this week with the u s federal reserve well and truly doubling down on its dovish guidance this month the global rate hiking cycle is at an end there are exceptions of course but the big central banks of the developed world the fed the european central bank and bank of japan have all reacted decisively to the steady drumbeat of depressing economic data by pushing any policy tightening plans to the backburner but instead of deriving any comfort from the pivot some in the market are interpreting the moves as desperate measures to ward off impending recession that fear is certainly evident on bond markets where the gap between three month and 10 year u s treasury yields one of the gauges the fed uses to assess inflation risks has inverted european yield curves too have flattened and german 10 year government borrowing costs have slid back below zero percent for the first time since 2016 there are outliers norway has hiked rates while hungary and czech rates may also rise this coming week one could argue norway s economy has been lifted by oil this year while emerging european economies have been recovering nicely but the question is with the world s biggest economy starting to hurt fed rate cuts bring priced for 2020 and g4 bond yields plunging can any market avoid being sucked in on wednesday new zealand s central bank could become the latest to flag downside risks to growth and interest rates 4 more worthless brexit voting march 29 is when britain was supposed to leave the european union 2 1 2 years after a slender majority voted to leave the bloc eu leaders have now granted prime minister theresa may a two week reprieve during which she must persuade lawmakers to accept the divorce deal she has negotiated not easy given they have resoundingly defeated it twice already she is expected to make another attempt and if the deal still fails several possibilities open up from a no deal brexit to brextension and even exit from brexit the question is whether may will be flexible on any of the red lines she outlined in 2016 ruling out a customs union with the eu uk s membership of the single market and any role for the european court of justice seen by many as an extreme interpretation of the referendum it has stymied efforts to find a solution to the northern ireland border issue with all this in play many warn that markets are still assigning too low a probability to a no deal brexit banks such as goldman sachs and deutsche reckon that risk at just 15 20 percent but though this is rising most analysts warn sterling has tumbled this month after strengthening for two months straight and jitters are bubbling up on derivative markets here one month pound risk reversals show an elevated premium for sterling puts options that confer the right to sell at a certain price implied sterling volatility a gauge of expected daily swings has slipped off highs but remain above some typically volatile emerging currencies such as brazil s real or the turkish lira 5 chinese currency and the trade war s next moves chinese markets aren t abandoning hopes that authorities may soon relax trading rules for the yuan beijing and washington are locked in heated discussions on a deal to end their trade war and president donald trump hopes to extract a commitment to yuan stability the chinese have other compulsions the yuan fell more than 5 percent in 2018 but this year it is rising too rapidly for comfort as china makes its way into global benchmark stock and bond indices foreigners are rushing into its markets in january and february inflows under the stock connect scheme were almost quadruple the amount last year rumors are swirling that china s currency regulator safe will rescind requirements for banks to maintain reserves on dollar purchase contracts and also remove the secretive x factor used to guide the currency s trading range theoretically those steps would count as efforts to free the yuan they were imposed last year to curtail speculators betting against the yuan detractors might say china is creating conditions for yuan depreciation the coming

fabricant agree may s brexit deal is better than not leaving at all brexit hardliner jacob rees mogg reiterated his backing to prime minister theresa may s deal as it s better than no brexit he tweeted that the choice seems to be mrs may s deal or no brexit also rees mogg explained in the monday moggcast podcast that i ve always thought that no deal is better than mrs may s deal but that mrs may s deal is better than not leaving at all while may s deal is in no way a good deal rees mogg said against that there are the threats of a long delay and many people in parliament who want to frustrate the result of the referendum conservative mp michael fabricant echoed as that it s the dreadful conclusion he came to too and a new pm can then negotiate a better and more distanced relationship with the eu after brexit of course this is the least worst option but the only practical way forward for now fabricant also said the practical alternatives are far worse that the withdrawal agreement including keeping us in the customs union and single market indefinitely so no control of immigration or having to obey eu directives yesterday the uk parliament seized control over brexit from the government after passing a cross party amendment by 329 to 302 it gives mps a series of votes on alternatives to prime minister theresa may s brexit deal including a second

he urged clearer reciprocity so that european businesses could have the same degree of access to the chinese market as chinese businesses have in europe macron said we would like to make progress renovating multilateralism we have divergences obviously in the history of humanity power does not go without rivalry none of us are naive macron added but we respect china and are determined to have

a noticeable cooling off of economic activity gfk k added that this is due to the so called five sages have lowered lowered their original growth forecast for this year from 1 7 to just 0 8 percent also the downturn is more due to foreign than domestic economic factors including the lack of decisiveness regarding brexit data and nature as well as us eu trade conflicts abenomics architect said boj ought to buy government bonds more aggressively kozo yamamoto a senior ruling ldp lawmaker and a key architect of abenomics complained that boj made a mistake in 2016 to change its policy to target interest rate under than yield curve control instead of the pace of monetary base expansion he said boj ought to buy government bonds more aggressively but it s difficult under the current ycc also yamamoto said he opposes the plan sales tax hike in october and discussed with prime minister shinzo abe but he cannot convince abe to put off the twice delayed sales tax hike he said the prime minister told me while i may be theoretically right it was politically difficult boj opinions downside risks to economy clearly heightening recently in the summary of opinions at the march 14 15 monetary policy meeting boj noted that while uncertainties regarding overseas economies started to become apparent from around last autumn slowdowns have materialized and reflecting these developments downside risks to japan s economy clearly have been heightening recently also it is concerning that developments toward an economic downturn could heighten depending on developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike on monetary policy boj maintained that it should persistently continue with the current monetary policy stance but it also emphasized that in case developments in economic activity and prices undergo a phase shift it is important to make preemptive policy responses on the data front japan corporate service price rose 1 1 yoy in

remains mildly in favor and break of 1 1273 will target a test on 1 1176 low decisive break there will resume whole decline from 1 2555 on the upside above 1 1448 will resume the rebound from 1 1176 to 1 1569 resistance instead in the bigger picture medium term outlooks is a bit mixed for now as there are conflicting signals we ll turn neutral first on the downside decisive break of 61 8 retracement of 1 0339 2016 low to 1 2555 2018 high at 1 1186 will resume the whole down trend from 1 2555 next target will be 1 0339 low nevertheless break of 1 1569 resistance should confirm medium term bottoming stronger rebound should be seen back to 38 2 retracement of 1 2555 to 1 1176 at 1 1703 in that case the structure of the rise from 1 1176 and reaction to 1 1703 fibonacci level will be

antm carlsberg as cabgy and south32 souhy here is a synopsis of all five stocks bull of the day with the market coming under pressure over the last couple of trading sessions it can feel like the best idea is to avoid stocks altogether over the long run that s never the case what you should look for is stocks that have great earnings trends which have suffered due to the temporary retreat in prices

service and support locations in 30 countries around the world currently ametek is a zacks rank 1 strong buy the reason for the favorable zacks rank lies in a series of earnings estimate revisions to the upside over the last thirty days ten analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current year while six have hiked their numbers for next year the bullish sentiment has pushed up the zacks consensus estimate for both of those periods current year estimates have gone from 3 61 to 4 04 while next year s numbers have gone from 3 83 to 4 30 it s no wonder that the stock has been on the move since bottoming out under 64 in late december ame shares have rallied over 25 the bulls didn t have the strength to take the stock powering through the 52 week high just north of 82 last friday s selling took the stock back under 80 for the first time since early march the 50 day moving average crossed over the 200 day on march 13th giving the golden cross buy signal the swing low in

in at 837 million three million shy of the mark that was the second consecutive miss for the stock this was part of the reason why analysts cut their expectations over the last week analysts have cut their estimates for the current quarter and current year the bearish sentiment has brought the zacks consensus estimate for the current quarter down from a 15 cent loss to a 25 cent loss the current

by reuters by dhara ranasinghe jennifer ablan and virginia furness london new york reuters whatever it takes is a daunting legacy for any departing central bank chief to bequeath a successor and leaves world markets anxious about what is to come after mario draghi leaves the european central bank later this year draghi s 2012 pledge to save the euro won the confidence of financial markets and arrested the currency bloc s debt crisis investors admired his willingness to break new policy ground manoeuvring past internal and external opposition and clear communication of the ecb s thinking with growth and inflation flagging again and the ecb s policy arsenal depleted whoever succeeds him may need to be similarly bold growing questions about the orthodoxies of economic policy including monetary policy models could present an additional test mohamed el erian chief economic adviser for allianz se in california said replacing draghi if badly handled could create significant uncertainty

the outlook for the housing market is improving amid declining mortgage rates markets have been roiled over the past few trading sessions following the federal reserve s stunning about face on interest rate increases and data that suggested slowing global growth traders are now pricing in a rate cut by the fed as early as september adding to the worries was the inversion of the u s treasury yield curve seen by many as a harbinger of recession the 10 year u s treasury yield edged up to 2 442 per cent having shed 5 basis points on monday and a whopping 17 5 basis points since the federal reserve last week ditched projections for raising rates this year the fact that markets were beaten up so much on friday people were looking at the yield curve and the stock market selling off and

remained murky as investors weighed the odds of whether the u s economy is in danger of slipping into recession risk of a u s economic slowdown has gone up and interest rates are on hold which is giving some stimulus to gold but it s not enough to sky rocket gold prices investors need more confirmation of further weakness in the economy sharma said u s federal reserve last week abandoned

global stock markets have been in retreat since friday on fears a us recession is not far away after part of the us yield curve inverted for the first time since 2007 last week with the current us economic expansion on course to reach the longest on record later in the year we ve seen sporadic recession predictions from economists and other commentators the market correction seen in the fourth quarter of 2018 renewed those claims though risk assets flying start to 2019 looked to give weight to economist paul samuelson s 1966 quip that stock markets have predicted nine of the last five recessions while stock markets and indeed economists may be poor forecasters of recession there is one proven predictor the yield curve the yield curve inverts when shorter dated us government bonds yield more than longer dated bonds normally the yield curve will be upward sloping as bond investors expect to be compensated more for tying their cash up for longer periods and are subject to greater inflation or interest rate risk this relationship occasionally breaks as near term fears mount and bond investors start to demand more compensation for shorter term loans than longer ones when short term rates are meaningfully higher than long term rates for an extended period it becomes unprofitable for banks to lend explains michel perera chief investment officer at canaccord genuity wealth management this spells trouble for the economy as bank lending starts to dry up in response eventually leading to a credit crunch the yield curve has inverted ahead of every one of the past nine us recessions and has thrown in only one false signal in the past half a century so it s certainly an indicator to take note of late in 2018 the yields on the five year treasury note briefly fell below that of the two year and three year securities this event was generally brushed off by market commentators as it s not the key measure most prefer to look at the 10 year yield versus either the three month or two year yield when the two year versus 10 year spread inverts a recession usually hits between six and 18 months down the line should investors be worried there seems a difference in opinion between commentators over whether the latest inversion is cause for concern one ought to heed the recession warning the yield curve is sending us simply because it has proven reliable so often in the past james dowey chief economist and chief investment officer at neptune investment management tells morningstar co uk however for reasons he s noted in the recent past it is not yet time to panic the term premium component of the curve which is the return investors demand for holding a 10 year government bond over a two year government bond has been supressed by quantitative easing over the past decade this means it is now quite easy for even modestly pessimistic growth expectations to invert the curve dowey explains most commentators are watching to see if the inversion becomes prolonged the three month 10 year curve tends to precede recessions when it inverts for greater than 10 straight days notes rory mcpherson head of investment strategy at psigma investment management if it is only a brief inversion says maurice harari manager of the oyster multi asset diversified fund it could be one of those few false signals in the past there have been some periods when the yield curve briefly inverted without a recession following like in the late 1990s he adds others put more weight on the two year versus 10 year spread as being the eminent recession indicator as at close of play on monday march 25 that spread stood at 17 basis points some meanwhile just see the inversion as an overdue reminder that economies are slowing and that a recession isn t on the cards for 2019 recession risk is higher for 2020 admits esty dwek senior investment strategist at natixis investment managers but for one to hit during an election year is unlikely with the fed s market friendliness likely to help extend the cycle perera agrees pointing out that none of the normal signals of a us recession are yet flashing red these signs include falls in profit margins financial stress corporate leverage and a housing market collapse finally harari adds that in this unprecedented environment of prolonged ultra accommodative monetary policies it is natural to see yield curves flatten as a result he thinks it could be hazardous to attempt historical comparisons is this time really different but these claims could be akin to this time is different syndrome a concept floated by economics professors carmen m reinhart and kenneth s rogoff after the great financial crisis this unrealistic optimism afflicted bankers investors and policymakers before the 1930s great depression the 1980s third world debt crisis the 1990s asian and latin american meltdowns and the major 2008 09 global downturn the harvard university lecturers wrote 10 years ago they add that in each of these cases key decision makers adopted beliefs that defied economic history these included claims in the 1920s that large scale wars were a thing of the past after the great war and speculation in the 1980s that high commodity prices low interest rates and reinvested oil profits would prop the economy up forever the most recent folly were claims in 2008 that globalisation better technology and sophisticated monetary policy would prevent an economic collapse every time fiscal leaders thought they had learned history s lessons and that this time the economy was different reinhart and rogoff said every time they were proved wrong jason borbora sheen co manager of the investec diversified income fund is certainly taking the threat seriously in fact he says his team has put the probability of a us recession in 2020 at 50 ever since around the start of the year if you look at different ways of cutting up the yield curve all of them send a very similar message which is that recession probabilities have certainly increased he explains one other measure that is pointing to a recession are the fed funds futures contracts that trade in expectations for us interest rates expectations for very near term rates have been inverted for a while now and turned very deeply negative on friday says borbora sheen so you ve got quite a lot of evidence coming from the bond market that there s a recession risk and we would ascribe to that he adds of course it s worth noting that while the yield curve is a good predictor of there being a recession ahead it s fairly poor at pinpointing exactly when one will occur notes vicky redwood senior economic adviser at capital economics that s shown by the general lead time being anywhere from nine months to two years away so even if a recession is coming it might still be a long way off redwood says it certainly pays to listen to and keep an eye on the yield curve just don t get too carried away just yet

gaap financial measures the tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted income taxes adjusted income tax rate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share each excluding the impact of special charges for each of the periods presented these financial measures also exclude in 2018 the impact of transition and integration costs associated with our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 as these items significantly impact comparability between years these financial measures also exclude for 2018 and the comparison of our results for 2019 to 2018 the net estimated impact of the effects of the one time transition tax and re measurement of our u s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the u s tax act passed in december 2017 as these items may significantly impact comparability between years adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted income taxes adjusted income tax rate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share represent non gaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles in our consolidated income statement we include separate line items captioned special charges and transaction and integration expenses in arriving at our consolidated operating income special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up front costs and organizational structural impact to require advance approval by our management committee comprised of our chairman president and chief executive officer executive vice president and chief financial officer president flavor solutions segment and mccormick international president global consumer segment and americas senior vice president human relations and senior vice president business transformation upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non cash component or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold impacted employees or operations expected timing and expected benefits to the management committee and the committee s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on going basis through completion transaction and integration expenses consist of expenses associated with the acquisition or integration of the rb foods business these costs primarily consist of outside advisory service and consulting costs employee related costs and other costs related to the acquisition we incurred these costs in 2018 income taxes associated with the enactment of the u s tax act in december 2017 consists of a net income tax benefit of 297 9 million recognized during the three months ended february 28 2018 which includes the estimated impact of the tax benefit from revaluation of net u s deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and the tax expense associated with the one time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non u s subsidiaries we believe that these non gaap financial measures are important the exclusion of special charges transaction and integration expenses and the net income tax benefit associated with enactment of the u s tax act provide additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends these non gaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these non gaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these non gaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to the related gaap financial measures is provided below

non recurring income tax benefit net associated with enactment of the u s tax act of 297 9 million for the three months ended february 28 2018 is based upon estimates and judgments that we believe to have been reasonable for the time period that benefit is provisional and changed during the measurement period which ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we made guidance issued and other actions taken as a result of the u s tax act different from that previously assumed 3 adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes excluding special charges and for the 2018 periods transaction and integration expenses or 162 1 million and 154 3 million for the three months ended february 28 2019 and 2018 respectively because we are a multi national company we are subject to variability of our reported u s dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed on a constant currency basis is a non gaap measure we believe that this non gaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the u s it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed in constant currency are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the u s dollar are translated into u s dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange

washington u s homebuilding fell more than expected in february as construction of single family homes dropped to near a two year low offering more evidence of a sharp slowdown in economic activity early in the year concerns over the economy were also underscored by other data on tuesday showing consumer confidence ebbing in march with households a bit pessimistic about the labor market the economy is facing rising headwinds including slowing global growth fading fiscal stimulus trade tensions and uncertainty over britain s departure from the european union those concerns contributed to the federal reserve s decision last week to bring its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy to an abrupt end as it abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year the sugar high is just about over said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pa the risks are more toward the downside than the upside housing starts decreased 8 7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 162 million units last month the commerce department said the percent decline was the largest in eight months and bad weather could have contributed to the sharp drop in homebuilding last month homebuilding fell in three of the four regions in february housing starts data for january and december were revised higher building permits fell 1 6 percent to a rate of 1 296 million units in february while that was the second straight monthly drop in permits they are now outpacing starts which suggests a pickup in homebuilding in the months ahead economists polled by reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a pace of 1 213 million units in february the housing market hit a soft patch last year squeezed by higher mortgage rates pricier lumber and land and labor shortages which led to tight inventories and more expensive homes but borrowing costs have eased in the wake of the fed s signaling of a long pause in hiking rates the 30 year fixed mortgage rate dropped to an average of 4 28 percent last week the lowest in more than a year from 4 31 in the prior week according to data from mortgage finance agency freddie mac house price inflation is also slowing a report from s p case shiller on tuesday showed house prices in the 20 metro area increased 3 6 percent from a year ago in january the smallest gain since september 2012 after rising 4 1 percent in december the moderation in mortgage rates and house prices is likely to improve affordability especially for first time homebuyers who have been largely priced out of the market but homebuilders remain constrained in their ability to construct more homes for the lower end of the market a survey last week showed confidence among homebuilders was steady in march with builders still complaining about the scarcity of skilled workers and land as well as zoning restrictions in many major metro areas storm clouds the run up in interest rates last year did some real damage said mark vitner a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte n c even with the recent slide in interest rates which reflects weakening economic conditions we do not feel we will see a rebound in housing demand until the storm clouds emanating from slower global economic growth clear later this year the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street were trading higher single family homebuilding which accounts for the largest share of the housing market tumbled 17 0 percent to a rate of 805 000 units in february the lowest level since may 2017 the percentage drop in single family homebuilding was the largest since february 2015 permits to build single family homes were unchanged in february at a pace of 821 000 starts for the volatile multi family housing segment jumped 17 8 percent to a rate of 357 000 units in february permits for the construction of multi family homes fell 4 2 percent to a pace of 475 000 units last month the weak housing data strengthens the view that the economy lost considerable momentum early in the first quarter retail sales rose moderately in january after tumbling in december and the manufacturing sector is struggling with output falling in february for a second straight month the atlanta fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1 3 percent annualized rate in the first quarter the economy grew at a 2 6 percent in the october december period a third report from the conference board on tuesday showed its consumer confidence index fell 7 3 points to a reading of 124 1 in march while noting that consumer confidence has been volatile in recent months the conference board said the overall trend in confidence has been softening since last summer pointing to a moderation in economic growth consumers assessment of both current business and labor market conditions weakened in march the survey s so called labor market differential derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful fell to an eight month low it was the second straight monthly decline in this measure which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the labor department s employment report the unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent and job growth decelerated sharply in february it does suggest that we may see the very low jobless rate become a little less low in march said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto it all comes down to the job market it is the single most important factor underpinning confidence and spending
by anne o krueger washington dc us president donald trump s trade war with china has been slogging along for more than a year now and could escalate further if current talks do not lead to a deal but in the meantime the trump administration has also accused two longstanding us partners turkey and india of benefitting unfairly from the us generalised system of preferences for developing countries having already erected trade barriers against turkey last year the us will now revoke the preferential treatment afforded to certain turkish and indian imports under the programme according to the us trade representative india has implemented a wide array of trade barriers that create serious negative effects on united states commerce in fact it is an insult to suggest that us industry cannot compete with lower productivity firms in a lower income country india s per capita gdp at around 1 900 in 2010 dollars is one quarter that of china and less than one twentieth that of the us and that is a vast improvement on previous decades when india like most developing countries was abjectly poor with an extremely low literacy rate abysmal infrastructure and a weak health system in 1960 the country s per capita gdp was a mere 304 after india s independence in 1947 its first government under prime minister jawaharlal nehru made economic development a top priority and based its policies on the belief that indian producers could not possibly compete with those in advanced economies accordingly india prohibited imports of goods that could be produced domestically and imposed high tariffs and quantitative restrictions on many other imports it was not alone during the decades after world war ii most other developing countries including china and turkey did the same while also establishing or expanding significantly the role of state owned enterprises soes and limiting or prohibiting that of private companies yet by the 1990s china india turkey and many other developing countries had all experienced decades of disappointing growth with trade protectionism having clearly impaired their competitiveness and overall economic performance they removed almost all of their quantitative restrictions and began lowering tariffs substantially at the same time many countries moved to more realistic exchange rates adopted policies to control inflation and relaxed or eliminated controls on private enterprises while reducing the role of soes in their economies the results ranged from good to spectacular for example in the three decades following south korea s adoption of an outward oriented trade strategy in the early 1960s real inflation adjusted wages there rose sevenfold the south koreans had moved to a realistic exchange rate allowed exporters to import intermediate inputs duty and license free lowered tariffs and kept inflation under control likewise china s growth started accelerating soon after it introduced market friendly economic reforms in the early 1980s as did india s following its reforms in the early 1990s lastly turkey despite being an oil importer experienced the highest growth rate in the world in the late 1980s following its removal of protectionist policies earlier that decade in all of these cases the lesson was learned open trade accompanied by appropriate domestic policies is good for growth there are a number of reasons for this whereas competition and the opportunity to learn from others make domestic producers more efficient and innovative high protectionist trade barriers can result in sclerotic monopolies moreover world markets enable economies of scale in production and provide exporters with the precise amount and type of inputs they need and precisely when they need them at the lowest price all told countries that have pursued greater economic openness have enjoyed improved nutritional health and educational outcomes as well as higher productivity and incomes and those that have not namely russia north korea and some countries in africa have fared poorly for an outward oriented strategy to be successful politicians must refrain from over regulating the economy and private economic activities should take place on a level playing field if a large country like china intervenes in ways that affect the world market such as by subsidising steel production a multilateral response is the best policy in an interconnected global economy all countries must work together the trump administration disagrees but its complaints about unfair tariffs elsewhere are hard to take seriously given that the us is raising its own trade barriers if history is any guide the current us approach to trade will result in deteriorating us economic performance because it implies that yesterday s industries will be coddled while the industries of tomorrow will be starved of investment the great irony is that if china india and other developing countries continue to remove protectionist barriers and create a level playing field they will grow stronger and more competitive vis à vis the us as a democracy with a rapidly growing economy india should be a natural friend for america not least in its efforts to contain china the trump administration s decision to pick on the country thus makes no sense indeed behind all of trump s trade moves is a perverse bargain the us is essentially threatening to harm its own economy unless other countries abolish their protectionist policies and become more competitive but if the goal is to protect us producers from foreign competition the administration should be doing exactly the opposite encouraging developing economies to increase their reliance on inefficient soes protecting against foreign competition and allowing political interference in the economy that together with higher investment in basic research education and infrastructure would ensure america s global economic primacy for decades to come anne o krueger a former world bank chief

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

bangladesh s banking sector faces a number of major challenges including rising nonperforming loans credit concentrations poor culture of professionalism the rise of family oligarchy lack of corporate culture capital market debility and parallel banking by the government through deficit financing instruments many of the challenges by now have turned into threats to the country s financial architecture mainly due to two reasons the central bank s weak leadership and the finance ministry s institutional trespassing on banking affairs a lack of knowledge on why policies should be consistent has led to a culture of financial indiscipline by definition the central bank is the single most powerful custodian of the banking sector this is also what the law states in 1972 bangabandhu formulated the bangladesh bank order which delineates the powers and responsibilities of the central bank of course it is linked to the finance ministry but the central bank isn t supposed to be a subsidiary office of the ministry it is supposed to be the custodian of the nation s currency supply and is responsible for preserving the right value of the currency as per the 1972 order the 2003 amendments made it clear that the ministry can t interfere in the internal policy decisions of the central bank but what we have seen is that finance ministers often speak as if they are a head of a monetary body what we have also seen is that bb seeks endorsements from the ministry even for day to day affairs this is a bad signal for professional bankers but a good signal for defaulters it is a virtual merger of the central bank with the secretariat under the office of the banking division unfortunately most of our institutions carry the vestiges of colonial legacy bureaucracy being its best example warrants reform and so does our central bank why the british at some point realised that their central bank should be bestowed with greater powers and discretion the bank of england s governor enjoys a high level of authority in monetary and financial decisions he was even made the chair of the financial stability board of great britain if we look further to the west the fed chair is deemed as the second most powerful person after the president in america the world has changed but we haven t it s as if the ministry expects a completely pliant leadership at the central bank so that the monetary authority can t question any weakness in fiscal capacity fiscal deficit and fiscal desperation this tug of war has always been there since the birth of the central bank but most countries have solved this conflict in two ways i by clearly separating the powers and responsibilities of these two institutions and ii by empowering the central bank to make it a nonpartisan custodian of the economy while the ministry gets its oxygen from political mandates the central bank can t hence it looks to the constitution for the powers bestowed upon it to guard the greater interests of the economy in a dispassionate scholarly honest and nonpolitical manner timely reform of the bb order and strong leadership at the central bank are the need of the hour to tackle the threats calling them challenges is an understatement looming in the banking sector and bangladesh has to do this because unlike other emerging countries the banking sector is the main vehicle of development since the capital market has already been partly vandalised the government has to understand that policy inconsistency will ruin the market in the long run it has to realise that the central bank should be the main controller of the interest rate all other interest rates even some offered on government instruments must follow the market or the long term bond rates assigned by the central bank otherwise attempts to develop either the bond market or secondary market will be thwarted short term management of fiscal deficit shouldn t empower the ministry to assign out of market interest rates to fiscal tools that is how fiscal desperation ruins the effectiveness of monetary policy we shouldn t forget what 16th century economist sir thomas gresham observed good and bad coins cannot circulate together the bad will drive the good away in the same way the bad interest rates which are of course good for the super rich on national savings certificates nscs are leading to deposit rates offered by the poor banks becoming dysfunctional the government wants the lending rates to be brought down to single digits how can it happen when the government itself is offering double digit rates on its nscs lending rates must sit on the deposit rates and the spread needed for bankers bread and butter sanchayapatra is doomed to fail no matter how much it grows the flood of inflows from sanchayapatra is temporarily hiding the fiscal incapacity of the ministry but it is leading to a burden on one of the most expensive ways of deficit financing in the world the interest liability is rising a threat that will wipe off a big segment of the budget which could otherwise be spent on development inconsistent policies and fiscal trespassing are the main hindrances to interest rate rationalisation the reserve bank of india made a policy so that government offered interest rates are always linked to the central bank s long term bond rates it s similar in the cases of sri lanka and pakistan and the central bank s long term bond rates by and large follow the neoclassical fisher equation where the nominal interest rate is a summation of the real interest rate and expected inflation while the real interest rate linked with the real economy should be more or less stable the nominal interest rate can go up if expected inflation rises and rates must fall when inflation drops our fiscal gurus seem to disregard this theory entirely it s a threat to the banking sector the ministry s behaviour which defies fisher s formula neither follows the dynamics of inflation nor does it understand why real interest rates matter for savings this duality is creating an interest rate anarchy in the entire banking sector making the most powerful tool of the sector defective this is the fiercest threat to the banking sector and one which actually masks the ministry s fiscal incapacity this is one of the main reasons why private investment as a share of gdp has remained almost stagnant for years this is also one of the main reasons why bangladesh still ranks below its neighbours in the ease of doing business index of the world bank thus institutional irregularities and a lack of understanding of the theoretical underpinnings are at the root of the weaknesses of our banking sector including the default culture and poor governance we live in a society whose ranking in the knowledge economy index is one of the poorest in asia and the pacific policymakers seem to be more comfortable creating space for obedience to compliance and not as comfortable freeing up space for knowledge research expertise and skills despite trumpeting about innovation et al we are the least innovative nation in asia we go on and on about our impressive growth figures but we have failed to generate adequate jobs for the youth in the country the informal sector still accounts for more than 80 percent of our labour force where is this growth going doesn t it nullify the truth of okun s law which says that higher growth generates higher levels of employment banking has come to a crossroads but better ways can still be found more autonomy for the central bank can be ensured by getting rid of the banking division of the ministry whose dual role is weakening the central administration of bb we don t need the national savings department banks are supposed to take on the role of deposit mobilisation nsd s nonmarket rates are obviously distortive for the market and private investment bangladesh shouldn t turn into a savings society it needs investment more than ever before more autonomy and greater economic insight of the central bank leadership along with the elimination of fiscal trespassing on banking affairs are the answers for a

brazil 55 years after the army staged a coup on 31 march 1964 and overthrew president joao goulart the new far right president jair bolsonaro has announced a celebration of this sad event there can be no doubt about the active support provided by the us government the world bank and the imf on 2 april 2014 a us ngo the national security archive nsa publicized an impressive amount of declassified official documents that testify to washington aiding and abetting the brazilian army officers who had overthrown joao goulart s democratic governement 50 years earlier see in the phd dissertation i presented at the universities of paris viii and liège in 2004 i discussed the support provided to the coup by washington the wb and the imf the relevant section is reproduced below support for the brazilian military junta after the overthrow of president joao goulart president joao goulart s democratic government was overthrown by the military in april 1964 wb and imf loans suspended for three years resumed very soon afterwards a brief time line in 1958 brazilian president kubitschek was about to undertake negotiations with the imf to gain access to a loan of 300 million dollars from the united states at the end kubitschek refused the imf imposed conditions and did without the us loan this earned him wide popularity his successor goulart announced that he would implement a radical land reform programme and proceed to nationalise petroleum refineries he was overthrown by the military the united states recognised the new military regime one day after the coup not long afterwards the wb and imf resumed their suspended lending policy as for the military they rescinded the economic measures the united states and imf had criticised note that international financial institutions were of the view that the military regime was taking sound economic measures yet the gdp fell 7 in 1965 and thousands of firms declared wbruptcy the regime organised harsh repression outlawed strikes caused a dramatic drop in real wages and eliminated direct ballot voting disbanded trade unions and made systematic use of torture president joao goulart s democratic government was overthrown since his first trip in may 1968 mcnamara regularly visited brazil where he did not miss meeting the military rulers the public reports of the wb systematically praised the policies of the dictatorship in reducing inequalities nevertheless inside the wb the discussions took a bitter turn when bernard chadenet vice president of project of the wb declared that the image of the wb is going to degrade following the support to the repressive government of brazil mcnamara recognized that there was a tremendous amount of repression but he added that it is not necessarily a great deal different from what it had been under previous governments and it did not seem to be a lot worse than in some other member countries of the wb is brazil worse than thailand some days later mc namara followed up no viable alternative to the government by generals seemed open the world wb realised very well that inequalities would not diminish and that its loans in the agricultural sector would reinforce the big landowners nevertheless it decided to carry on the loans because it absolutely wanted to put the government under its influence now at this juncture the wb met an obvious failure the military regime demonstrated a deep mistrust in the context of the wbs desire to increase his presence finally at the end of the 70s they took advantage of a profusion of loans from the international private bankers granted at a lower rate of interest than that of the wb and moved away from the wb which they found less useful how political and geostrategical considerations influence world wb lending policy article iv section 10 stipulates the wb and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions and these considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes set by the wb stated in article i the wb has found many systematic means of getting round the prohibiting its operations taking political and non economic considerations into account one of the primary stipulations of its charter from its founding onwards the wb refused loans to post liberation france as long as the communists remained in the government the day after they left the government in may 1947 the loan france had requested blocked until then was granted the wb has repeatedly contravened article iv of its own statutes in truth the wb has made many choices based on political considerations the quality of governments economic policies is not the determining element in its choices the wb has often lent money to the authorities in countries despite the dismal quality of their economic policies and a great degree of corruption indonesia and zaire are two cases in point specifically wb choices relative to countries that play a major political role in the eyes of its major shareholders are regularly linked to these shareholders interests and outlooks starting with the united states from 1947 to the collapse of the soviet bloc world wb and imf decisions were determined in large part by the following criteria avoid shoring up self reliant models provide funding to large scale projects wb or policies imf enabling major industrialised countries to increase exports refuse to help regimes seen as a threat by the united states government or other important shareholders attempt to modify the policies of certain governments in the so called socialist countries so as to weaken the cohesion of the soviet bloc this is why support was granted to yugoslavia which had dropped out of the moscow dominated bloc from 1948 or to romania from the 1970s at the time when ceaucescu was attempting to take his distances from the comecon and the warsaw pact support strategic allies of the western capitalist bloc and in particular of the us i e indonesia from 1965 to the present day mobutu s zaire the philippines under marcos brazil under the dictators after the 1964 coup dictator somoza s nicaragua apartheid south africa attempt to avoid or to limit in so far as possible closer links between third world countries and the soviet bloc or china for example distancing the ussr from india and sukarno era indonesia to carry out this policy the world wb and the imf have generalised a tactic greater flexibility towards right wing governments less demanding in terms of austerity measures facing a strong left opposition than to left wing governments facing strong opposition from the right concretely that means ifi are more demanding and make life more difficult for left wing governments to weaken them and ease the right s path to power according to the same logic the ifi have made fewer demands on right wing governments facing a left wing opposition to avoid weakening them and preventing the left from coming to power monetarist orthodoxy has variable geometrics the variations depend on many political and geostrategic factors the imf and world wb did not hesitate to support dictatorships when they and other major capitalist powers found it opportune the author of the world report on human development published by undp 1994 edition says so in black and white but rhetoric is running far ahead of reality as a comparison of the per capita oda received by democratic and authoritarian regimes shows indeed for the united states in the 1980s the relationship between aid and human rights has been perverse multilateral donors also seem not to have been bothered by such considerations they seem to prefer martial law regimes quietly assuming that such regimes will promote political stability and improve economic management after bangladesh and the philippines lifted martial law their shares in the total loans given by the world wb declined footnotes eric toussaint doctoral thesis in political science presented in 2004 at the universities of liège and paris viii

islamabad finance minister asad umar said monday that while pakistan s position remained unchanged the international monetary fund imf had shifted its stance to the outstanding issues raising hope for an early package replying to questions here at the prime minister office the minister said imf had changed its position and a considerable gap had been now narrowed down after they watched the government taking extremely difficult decisions he pointed out that the situation which this government inherited was unprecedented as compared to 2008 2013 and when the pti formed government the foreign exchange reserves were depleted to imports for 15 days and this was never witnessed in the past however he noted that there had been improvement owing to the government measures and the imf acknowledged these measures which saw a significant reduction in current account deficit as compared to the last year prime minister imran khan had specially summoned the finance minister as well as chairman energy task force nadeem babar to respond to questions from media on economy and energy related issues while he spoke generally on other matters asad umar said the imf s view was that the economic challenges that the pti government was confronted with after coming into power were far worse than the situation in 2008 and 2013 when pakistan had signed programmes he emphasised that pakistan was not required to take drastic measures as those already taken in past few months were enough to restore macroeconomic stability however the minister did not rule out some additional measures including currency devaluation the minister said there is was a possibility that pakistan and the imf may sign a deal at the end of imf staff level mission that will arrive in pakistan in the third week of april and the discussions will also take place next month in washington asad umar made it clear that the government could not end all the losses in the energy sector at once and it would gradually be doing away with subsidies he pointed out that overvaluation of the rupee massively damaged the economy the minister noted that the exchange rate was linked with economic fundamentals and as long as there was current account deficit the rupee would keep on shedding its value imran khan said reduction in the public debt as a barometer to gauge the success of his government and added if the pti government managed to reduce the public debt to rs20 trillion from the current rs30 trillion then it will mean we were successful and if the public debt crossed over rs30 trillion then it will mean we have failed the prime minister called on the nation to pray as there was a hope of discovery of large off shore oil and gas reserves nadeem babar said that the government would issue new exploration licenses for 30 blocks to find gas he said that the onshore drilling by two companies was affected due to the security situation he said that there was possibility that this could be largest hydro carbon discovery in asia on the energy situation he pointed out that there were serious issues of demand and gas supply due to article 158 of the constitution as sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and balochistan had priority right on domestic gas which had created the pricing issue due to expensive lng imports on its part the pml n government in its tenure ignored the power transmission and distribution networks as their focus remained on power generation he said the electricity prices for next two years could go up due to passing on the impact of rs226 billion investment in the power generation and rs170 billion idle capacity payments of the past years he explained this would have resulted in rs4 50 per unit increase but prime minister imran khan refused to do it in one go baber said that the last pml n government did not fully fund electricity subsidies that led to non payment of rs157 billion subsidies by the finance ministry and in future the subsidies would be fully reflected in the budget he said that the pti government was working on reduction of distribution losses hoping to achieve nepra s benchmarks by june 2020 at this point asad umar asked a question from former prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi as to whether there was some national security issue involved which barred them from issuing exploration licenses

remember when republicans cared about budget deficits last week the government announced that february s red ink set a monthly record 234 billion in a growing economy setting an annual deficit record is like having your house go into foreclosure when the family income is 500 000 something is wrong as recently as 2015 the deficit was 438 billion yet republican policies have the deficit on track to be 1 1 trillion for this year in a growing economy for perspective the deficit was 1 4 trillion in 2009 remember though that to hold off a second depression congress had to pass the 700 billion financial bailout and the 787 billion fiscal stimulus during that budget cycle and revenue tanked with the economy republicans can t use calamity as a defense in fiscal terms the gop sinned most notably by passing the 2017 tax cut on a party line vote in the senate and a mostly party line vote in the house thirteen gop house members honorably defected republicans crafted that legislation to please megadonors and corporations the plan offered no structural changes to help the economy over time and thus needlessly increased the deficit economic growth for 2018 was 3 1 percent a rise of just one half a percentage point that s a puny return on the 1 5 trillion that the tax cut will cost an infrastructure plan focused on broadband and power and transportation networks would have been far more productive president trump proclaimed that the tax cut would help the middle class in fact estimates are that he will save 11 million a year of course he also proclaimed that he would lower the trade deficit which is at a 10 year high the president said companies would use tax savings to boost pay and hire more employees in fact many large corporations used the money on stock buybacks which set a record last year after the tax plan became law last month sen marco rubio fumed on twitter about the buybacks in one post rubio promised permanent preference to investments that will drive the creation of jobs increase in wages rubio is late with his outrage and later still with his suggestion amid the current fiscal misfeasance recall that the country ran budget surpluses from 1998 until 2001 it took mischief and luck the republican controlled congress and president clinton raided the social security trust fund the dotcom bubble caused capital gains revenue to spike still divided government got it done in april 2000 clinton addressed the american society of newspaper editors and mused about the country paying off its debt which was about 5 trillion it s now 22 trillion deficit reversal began under president george w bush seeing those surpluses he proposed a tax cut to give the people their money back democrats were complicit in passing that plan which did no more good than the 2017 tax cut then came the wars in afghanistan and iraq the so called war on terror has cost about 2 4 trillion with no tax increases or budget cuts to offset any of it for good measure republicans in 2003 passed the medicare prescription drug benefit with no payroll taxes or premiums to finance it part d adds roughly 100 billion to the deficit former house speaker paul ryan once lectured president obama on budget deficits yet ryan shepherded that budget busting tax cut through the house last week federal reserve chairman lawrence powell said deficits matter but he sounds like the housemother trying to break up the frat party a few adults are around speaker nancy pelosi faced down an attempt by young ultra liberal democrats to reject paygo offsetting new spending with tax increases or cuts house democrats have presented a sensible plan to shore up social security some senate republicans have offered ideas to reduce the deficit fiscal responsibility in washington however is as dated as the vcr improvement starts with actually passing a budget which congress seems unable to pull off the mueller report may consume the political media industrial complex but those budget numbers don t lie though republicans once chided democrats as tax and spend liberals they abdicated on fiscal policy years ago now the chaperones outdrink everyone

history adjusted ebitda for fiscal year 2019 was a record 212 8 million a 27 increase from last fiscal year and approximately 18 higher than our previous annual adjusted ebitda record in addition same store sales retail gross margin and bad debt charge offs all improved significantly in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year as we start the new fiscal year our focus is on retail growth and we expect to achieve both positive same store sales and accelerated store growth our ability to simultaneously manage retail growth and credit risk is the combination of our business transformation and we are embarking on the next phase of our business plan our strategy is to produce 8 to 10 annual retail sales growth and controlled credit performance which drives a very powerful financial model we believe we can grow at this rate for many years to come and we are extremely excited by the long term opportunity we have in front of us to create sustainable shareholder value so with this introduction let s look at our fourth quarter results in more detail starting with our retail business as we have stated on previous calls we believe our non harvey market performance is the best indicator to use when analyzing our retail business during the quarters impacted by the hurricane advertisement advertisement i am pleased to report the same store sales for the fourth quarter in non harvey markets were up 3 7 which validates our retail growth initiatives and is in line with our long term expectation of achieving positive low single digit same store sales overall same store sales were down 1 4 for the fourth quarter primarily due to the benefits hurricane harvey rebuilding efforts had in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year same store sales in harvey markets were down 12 9 in the fourth quarter as we mentioned in our third quarter conference call strong novembers sales benefited from higher promotional activity in the large screen tv category this pulled demand forward and sales trends decelerated throughout the fourth quarter in addition we believe the government shutdown also impacted fourth quarter sales trend looking at fiscal year 2019 sales total retail sales were positive for the year ending january 31 2019 which is the first year of positive retail sales growth in three years in addition for fiscal year 2019 non harvey same store sales were down 1 which is close to our long term annual same store sales guidance lease to own sales were 8 1 for the fourth quarter and were an annual record 7 5 for fiscal year 2019 for the month of january 9 2 of retail sales were financed through lease to own programs reflecting the progress we are making toward our 10 lease to own sales goal advertisement advertisement expanding our product categories is another component of our retail growth strategy during fiscal year 2019 we successfully added gaming systems and robotic vacuums to our assortment and i m pleased to report these new product initiatives performed better than expected we also recently launched new upholstery and dining collection and the initial reaction from our customers has been encouraging during fiscal year 2020 we will continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings with complimentary category that align with our retail and our retail and our credit strategy as a result during the first half of fiscal year 2020 we will begin testing cellphone and flooring products in our stores these large compelling and exciting categories resonate with our customers and support our strategy of adding aspirational home products that our customers can affordably finance we plan on launching new marketing initiatives throughout fiscal year 2020 to help from our expanding product assortment and growing retail presence our product strategy is also benefiting retail gross margin which increased 230 basis points in the fourth quarter to a quarterly record of 42 4 on an annual basis retail gross margin was a record 41 2 and was the first time we have reported annual retail gross margin over 40 we believe our retail gross margin is sustainable as we continue to benefit from our better best product strategy looking at first quarter sales february sales were impacted by the slow start to tax season and lower refunds during the month while the pace of tax refunds has improved and helped march sales we are cautious on first quarter sales due to february slow start in addition harvey continues to impact current sales trends we will begin lapping the impact from harvey rebuilding efforts in the back half of this fiscal year which will help same store sales advertisement advertisement for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we are guiding non harvey same store sales in the range of negative 2 to positive 2 and harvey same store sales in the range of negative 12 to negative 8 during fiscal year 2019 we opened a total of seven new stores including stores in texas virginia and louisiana new store revenues and credit performance continue to be in line with our expectation which provides us with increasing confidence in our retail expansion plan with our enhanced credit model in place new stores are ramping at a slower rate as we closely control credit risk we expect sales in new stores to mature to our company average over time which will provide a tailwind to same store sales once new stores build the base of recurring customer from a credit standpoint first payment default rates on originations in our new stores opened between july and december 2018 were nearly 20 lower than first payment default rate on total originations made during the same time period highlighting our ability to prudently manage credit risk as we open new stores for fiscal year 2020 we plan to open 12 to 15 new stores in existing states which will all be in our new store layout featuring an enhanced customer experience and a more efficient sales process to date in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we have opened a new store in montgomery alabama and a new store in new orleans louisiana we plan to open two more stores in new orleans in the coming months and we are extremely excited about our opportunity in this new market with 125 stores in 14 states we have a significant and long term opportunity to expand our store base in addition to our investments in new stores we plan on opening our new houston distribution center late this summer once operational we expect the state of the art facility to improve our logistics efficiencies across our largest market as we increase new store investment control sales of new locations transition into our new houston d c and make further investments in our i t systems to support our growth we expect some margin degradation will temporarily occur advertisement advertisement however we expect to leverage these investments as we lap initial costs and grow sales we are excited to execute our retail growth plan and i look forward to sharing our success in the coming quarters now let s take a look at our strong credit performance during the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 our credit segment achieved several milestones during fiscal year 2019 including a record annual net yield of 21 3 and a periodic charge off rate of 12 7 which is in line with our long term annual loss expectation of 12 to 13 this performance helped drive 32 1 million improvement in annual adjusted credit segment operating income which ended the year at 5 7 million versus a loss of 26 4 million last fiscal year in fact this was the best annual adjusted credit segment operating income conn s has produced in five years for fiscal year 2019 conn s credit spread increased to 860 basis points compared to 420 basis points in the prior fiscal year in dollar terms our annual credit spread increased 111 to 131 1 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to 62 2 million for fiscal year 2018 we are closing in on our 1000 basis point annual credit spread target which we expect to achieve this fiscal year for the fourth quarter interest income and fees were a record 85 4 million and increased over 9 from the prior fiscal year period as a result of higher interest rate and better charge off performance this drove a 110 basis point year over year improvement in our net yield which was 21 6 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 higher rates of no interest receivables and charge offs typically occur in the fourth quarter which happened this year and drove a 10 basis point reduction in our net yield compared to the third quarter rate advertisement advertisement as we have stated previously we believe our portfolio will ultimately achieve our net yield goal of 23 to 25 and we are confident we will produce a 1000 basis point spread during fiscal 2020 recent 60 plus day delinquency trends demonstrate that we have reached credit stabilization as a result of the successful underwriting changes we implemented several years ago as a result we expect delinquency rates to range between 9 to 10 of the total portfolio carrying value which will vary quarter to quarter based on typical seasonal trend our credit results continue to demonstrate better operating performance and favorable credit trend i am confident in the continued strength of our credit platform and our ability to manage risk going forward especially as our retail growth accelerate so to conclude my prepared remarks before i turn the call over to lee fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 results demonstrates the strength of our financial model and a positive evolution of our business we continue to believe our retail model and credit platform can consistently support total annual retail sales growth of 8 to 10 and we believe we are well positioned to achieve this goal in fiscal year 2020 with this let me turn the call over to lee advertisement advertisement lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks norm consolidated revenues were 433 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 a 3 increase from 420 4 million for the same period last fiscal year gaap net income improved significantly to a record 29 5 million or 0 91 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 3 2 million or 0 10 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year quarter on a non gaap basis adjusting for certain charges and credits and losses from extinguishment of debt net income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 was 0 96 per diluted share compared to 0 56 per diluted share for the same period last fiscal year adjusted ebitda was 67 7 million or 15 6 of total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 57 5 million or 13 7 of total revenue for the same period last fiscal year reconciliations of gaap to non gaap financial results are available on our fourth quarter press release that was issued this morning fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 retail revenues were 338 9 million an increase of 1 3 from the same quarter last fiscal year we achieved record retail gross margins for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 a 42 4 the 230 basis points year over year improvement in retail gross margin was a result of the continued benefits of our better best product strategy which is enabled by our strong credit platform retail sg a expense was 87 million an increase of approximately 3 9 million from the same quarter in the prior fiscal year while retail sg a expense as a percentage of revenue deleverage 90 basis points to 25 7 primarily due to costs for new stores and an increase in the corporate overhead allocation advertisement advertisement as norm previously mentioned we plan on opening 12 to 15 new stores this fiscal year we typically start incurring costs associated with new stores approximately six months ahead of opening and there will be additional expenses incurred throughout the fiscal year as we prepare to open these locations we remain focused on strategies to control as sg a expenses however the company will be making investments in new stores along with continued enhancements to our business platforms to ensure our ability to successfully manage future growth turning now to our credit segment to make it easier for investors to understand our customer accounts receivable and associated credit performance we are now presenting certain credit measures primarily those in note 2 of our 10 k on a carrying value basis carrying value presentation reduces the value of the customer accounts receivable balance by adjusting for deferred fees and origination costs the allowance for no interest option credit programs and the allowance for uncollectable interest our percentages and balances of accounts receivable 60 days plus past due in reaged accounts receivable calculated under our previous and current methodology are available in our investor presentation which is on our website references to balances and percentages of accounts receivable 60 days plus past due or reaged on today s conference call and going forward will be at carrying value finance charges and other revenues for the credit segment were a quarterly record of 94 1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 up 9 6 from the same period last fiscal year the increase versus last fiscal year was primarily due to a yield of 21 6 an increase of 110 basis points from last fiscal year as expected there continues to be no retrospective commissions as a result of higher claim volumes related to the increased severity weather events in addition to lower interest penetration rates and rate changes we continue to actively monitor both our partners and overall insurance performance fourth quarter net annualized charge offs as a percent of the average outstanding balance were 12 7 a 220 basis point improvement over the prior fiscal year it is also important to note that fourth quarter net charge offs declined 6 3 million or 11 2 compared to the prior fiscal year for the fiscal year 2019 net charge offs were 32 8 million or 14 5 lower than last fiscal year our periodic charge off rate is now in line with our long term guidance and as a result we are no longer providing static loss guidance for specific periods of originations we believe we can continue to achieve a periodic loss rate between 12 and 13 as we open new stores and grow retail sales provision for bad debts in the credit segment was 55 4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 an increase of 0 7 million from the same period last fiscal year primarily due to growth of the portfolio the allowance for bad debt and uncollectible interest as a percent of the total portfolio was 13 5 at january 31 2019 which was up 20 basis points from the prior fiscal year period improving our recovery process has been a strategic focus throughout this fiscal year as higher recoveries benefit cash collections and reduce loss rates on our allowance for bad debt for fiscal year 2019 we collected 18 8 million of recoveries almost doubling last fiscal year results of 10 9 million we made progress implementing additional recovery partners during the fourth quarter and we believe we are on track to collect annual recoveries exceeding 20 million in fiscal year 2020 for the month of february recoveries exceeded 2 million which is the strongest month of recoveries we have ever achieved and reflect continued improvement sg a expense in the credit segment for the fourth quarter increased 13 7 versus the same quarter last fiscal year and on annualized basis as a percentage of the average customer portfolio balance was 10 1 compared to 9 2 the increase in credit sg a expense primarily reflects the investments we are making to pursue our compelling recovery opportunity and increase in compensation costs and an increase in the corporate overhead allocation interest expense for the fourth quarter was 15 2 million which was a decrease of 15 5 from the same period last fiscal year as a result of continued year over year deleveraging and reductions in all in cost of funds for the fourth quarter annualized interest expense as a percentage of average portfolio balance was 3 9 compared to 4 8 for the same period last fiscal year average net debt as a percentage of average portfolio balance was approximately 59 4 compared to approximately 69 5 for the same period last fiscal year abs notes currently outstanding include the b and c classes of our 2017 b notes and all classes of our 2018 a note we currently expect to complete two abs transactions during fiscal year 2020 i am pleased with the improvements we made in our capital position during fiscal year 2019 we expect to fund the anticipated growth in our portfolio as a result of new store openings and same store sales growth through internally generated funds and our existing capital sources with this overview norm and i are happy to take your questions operator please open the call up to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brian nagel with oppenheimer and company please proceed with your question brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst hi good morning norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman good morning brain brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst thanks for taking my question first off congrats i know you definitely made significant progress here over the last several quarters inaudible norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thank you brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst the question i have is for both norm and lee with regard to sales growth look there s a lot of trends toward packers ph are trading seemingly trend toward packers out there whether there would be other issues with the government shutdown or et cetera but it still seems as though there s something kind of there s a factor or factors there is sort of holding back which should be better retail sales growth given all the improvements in the business and you ve taken a very analytical approach to had a better address or penetrate your customer so the question i have is if you look at all this what is holding it back right now what can you see that s holding back which should be better underlying sales growth norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman what i would say brian is first when you look at you re right there are a lot of moving parts and a lot of transitory things harvey the lapping of harvey being a significant element and as you look at the same store sales results for the fourth quarter from a harvey standpoint it is down 12 9 which was greater than what we anticipated it to be however as we had shared the non harvey was actually up 3 7 which you have to go back five years to find a same store sales number that s in that range where the companies performed at that level and we saw strong performance in november even december was a strong performance almost 5 same store sales in december january early part of january we saw nice performance in january until the middle part of the month or so early mid part of the month with the government shut down and that obviously and ultimately the end of the day resulted in a 3 7 number up from an non harvey standpoint so i will tell you brian i m very very pleased with the underlying performance because i seen non harvey as the underlying performance and our february tax season is very very important to our customers and if you look at february results we re down about 4 same store sales in february in non harvey harvey was actually down 17 and harvey impacted even more last year because the fact that last year during tax season people had fun to be able to buy our products that they typically wouldn t be able to do during the year so now what we re seeing in march and april if you look at our midpoint our implied midpoint from march and april we re looking just a little bit under 2 for the two month in non harvey and even harvey down only about 6 but if you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter those are the implied numbers for march and april so what i would say is i know there s a lot of noise and moving parts i ve never been more bullish than i am as i sit here today and where our performance is and our long term model as you well know is low single digit same store sales and we were there and exceeded that in the fourth quarter and could it be very close to that we think here in the first quarter and position ourselves with the new store growth as well to really take advantage of our very powerful retail model going forward brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst that s really helpful let me just ask one followup with regard to harvey we ve been talking about the harvey affected market now for a while what is is it simply that i think you may have alluded to this in the prepared comments that following the weather events there was this surge of demand as people replace products within that that has basically inaudible demand going forward or what is i guess first i m really asking what is it with what s the dynamic behind harvey and how should we think about that what has to happen that it will take norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman that s a great question brian so what happens is after the hurricane you within about 30 or 45 day time frame you start to see recovery and increase sales from a replacement standpoint so for us that was in the middle of the third quarter to fourth quarter harvey as everyone knows was a rain event so it stretched out even longer than what you d typically see with a wind event hurricane and so we re lapping through the first quarter that the numbers will start to abate in the first quarter there will still be an impact in the second quarter and then in the third quarter very early in the quarter there might be a little bleed into that but for the most part as the vast majority of that will be lapsed on the rebuilding side now the one area that could linger a little bit and impact we re not talking double digits here but could have a could put some downward pressure in that market is you do pull replacements forward when you have a hurricane so somebody that wouldn t be replacing potentially their refrigerator or their furniture for another year and year and a half are forced to do it because of the hurricanes so you get some pull forward of demand that that will pull downward some downward pressure but nothing like we re seeing here over the this quarter and last quarter brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst thank you very much best of luck norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thanks brian operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens inc please proceed with your question rick nelson stephens inc analyst hi thanks good morning want to followup on the retail gross margin record levels and up 160 basis points if you had a mix shift toward what i would think would be lower margin electronics and i d like to get behind what is driving that improvement lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey rick it s lee so as you said rightly so there was a mix shift in with more electronics one of the things that we have done i think an excellent job in credit to the merchandising team is continuing to look at your better stores being getting the right value from our vendors and you ll see that come through so we ve been extremely pleased but even with the mix shift change that you ve seen a higher margin so it s one of the things that we talked about on the call though again we ve done a lot of that so as we go forward obviously it is important for us to continue and we are focused on enhancing the mix with furniture and mattress because obviously that s a higher margin but again i think it is a big hats off to our team here that we were able to produce those margins with this mix norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman there s been a lot of focus on for obvious reasons on the credit side and the investment we ve done from a people standpoint there but we ve made significant investments from a people standpoint on the retail side of the house as well and the merchandising the buying team the effectiveness that team has brought to the table here this past year as far as how they buy who they buy from the programs they have in place with our vendors all have has been accretive and enabled us to achieve the record quarterly gross margin we had this past quarter now as we mentioned we won t we still think we have upside primarily driven by mix going forward but as we said in the prepared comments our business model had a 40 plus retail margin is extremely powerful which is really what our target has been all along to get into that 40 plus margin rate rick nelson stephens inc analyst are you in fact taking any prices up in the store to try to stimulate that margin norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman we are not and we still price we do math minus 10 pricing from an advertising standpoint we still match pricing from price guarantee for anything that s advertised with our major competitors none of that has changed rick rick nelson stephens inc analyst the down payment rate was 2 first ph quarter it s been trending lower for some time now had there been inaudible to drive same store sales and are there credit implications down the line from that strategy norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman no it s not at all an effort to drive same store sales it s really just inherent credit quality it s been a little bit better coming in and depending on the overall credit quality coming in is really what s driving that more than anything rick nelson stephens inc analyst got you and store growth which is really ramping this year if you could speak to the stores that are now opening here i think there were couple in texas you opened a year ago at this time how those are performing versus the store model that you ve got it in your powerpoint page 14 lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey rick it s lee we re very pleased with our store openings and they re in line with our expectations again as we ve talked about stores that are in all of our stores we re opening are in existing states but we do have stores in existing markets and what you see is those stores in the existing markets where we already have advertised and have the brand name we see a higher ramp than what we have sort of our midpoint average range of sales in the first year and then when we re going into new markets even though there are existing states are still new markets obviously a bit of a slower ramp but online expectations and we re very excited as norm talked about on the call with a new store in montgomery alabama now it s a new market and a new store in new orleans and we ve talked about two more stores just very excited about the reception that we re receiving in those markets and again we ve again we re very excited about the new store growth plan that we ve got this year and the reception we believe will get norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman and one final thing on rick is your question is kind of ties to me the question that you had mentioned about the margin i m sorry about the deposit down payment and as we mentioned in the we highlighted it in the script just so that folks who are comfortable with the fact that we are not playing with the credit model to drive retail sales now we we re not going to do it if we re not seeing the return on investment invested capital and the risk is not appropriate and we highlighted that our first payment default for our new markets in the back half of last year are actually 20 lower than the total portfolio which speaks to the fact that the tax we re taking here is a long term one of we can drive same positive same store sales low single digit by what s within our control from a merchandising or retail execution standpoint a marketing standpoint and maintain that credit portfolio in a very stable position and we re not going to vary from that as tempting as sometimes it might be for folks to want us to do that rick nelson stephens inc analyst great good to here thanks and good luck lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks rick operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kyle joseph with jefferies please proceed with your question kyle joseph jefferies llc analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my questions going back to tax refunds you guys talked about the impact on retail sales just looking at the results and guidance it doesn t look like there was an impact on credit but can you just talk about inaudible sort of delays there and impacts on inaudible norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman yes we saw a little bit of an impact more driven because our execution is getting better on the collection side of the house what i would say is we didn t have as good a performance in the last part of february from a collection execution standpoint that we anticipated even though it was stronger performance than prior year but i will tell you that in march with the refunds catching up we re seeing for the two months our performance be end up being where we expected to be overall kyle joseph jefferies llc analyst got it and then lee kind of talked about credit getting approaching the 12 to 13 long term target in terms of losses but looking at your credit guidance for the first quarter it looks very good looks like you guys are guiding toward a provision being down a little bit year over year is that just ongoing lingering strength from the end of the year and you d anticipate it sort of stabilizing going forward particularly in the context that your portfolio is now growing a bit lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes part of that s obviously seasonality in q1 kyle but but again we re very pleased with the credit platform and the results that were receiving there so again don t anticipate any major changes from that perspective kyle joseph jefferies llc analyst got it thanks very much for answering my questions lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks kyle operator thank you our next question comes from line of brad thomas with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst hey good morning norman lee and let me add my congratulations as well on another solid year here norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thanks brad bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst let s hear a couple of questions if i could just to follow up on that dynamic of your forecast for provisions for 1q in dollars the provisions were up a little bit in 4q your portfolio is obviously growing you have a model down in 1q i guess just wanted to follow up on the puts and takes there particularly as you look at what s happening with tax refunds of late lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes brad it s lee so again obviously q1 you get the tax refunds that come in and again with this norm talked about the better collections execution so therefore less charge offs so that s really what s going to drive our from our projection when we put our guidance to lower provision here so norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman that s the 2 million in recovery lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer it s true absolutely norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman we mentioned in february that we re really starting to get traction there as well so that s a nice tailwind for us as well from a credit standpoint bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst got you ok and then as we think about sg a obviously you ll be opening up stores here and incur some costs ahead of when those stores actually are open in the fourth quarter sg a dollars up almost 8 it looks like maybe in 1q what s implied is it might not grow at quite that high of a rate but at a high level is that what you think we should be thinking about here kind of a mid maybe high single digit growth rate in sg a dollars for the year norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman yes i think that s directionally correct brad what i would say is we have to get to the point of where we lap the consistent number of new stores that s really not the only driver but it s probably 70 of the driver of that sg a cost lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes brad that s right and obviously as norm talked about until we start lapping the number of new stores but one other thing that we did talk about on the call we are making our investments in new systems which we re extremely excited about we will get leverage on the future but that obviously had some costs but again some of the things that we re doing from sg a perspective we talk about the new stores and the importance of execution of those obviously we re hiring managers and training that are in our existing stores so that we can have existing managers and go staff the new stores because it s so important to get good execution from the new stores all of those do add some incremental costs that are important and they re the right investments to make but that s again as we talk about the sg a increase that s what s driving some of those things bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst yes and just if i kind of triangulate here you all obviously don t give explicit earnings guidance for quarters or for the annual basis but when i think about the credit seasoning tailwind that you still have that confidence in the 1000 basis point spread when i look at your implied guidance for 1q it does look like we should have earnings higher year over year in 1q and i would think we should get that in just about every quarter of this year with what you know today do you think that s a reasonable way of looking at the business norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman we clearly don t like to guide beyond the quarter we re in but i think that s a very reasonable way to look at the business lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer brad the one thing to keep in mind obviously we ve talked about it as we grow the portfolio we do have to take that allowance set up fronts of that again add with growth you do get some hit to your credit from that perspective norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman from the provision lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer from the provision exactly bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst great and if i could squeeze one more in from a product perspective is it the furniture mattress category did see some acceleration from 3q into 4q but performance in that category a little bit below some other areas of the store i guess can you talk about what s going on in there any other opportunities are you still pleased with the switch that you made from the temper products over to the sort of siemens ph products anymore color would be great norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman yes i mean we are still pleased with the transition that we made we are seeing a little more softness on the mattress side than we are on the furniture side when you look at the two categories but frankly we feel as much of it is on from a retail execution standpoint and we have the ability to impact that so our expectation going forward is those categories are bread and butter and both mattress and furniture and leaders force and we re looking for improved performance there going bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst very helpful thank you guys norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thanks brad lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brad operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr miller for any final comments norm miller president chief

new york march 21 2019 moody s investors service moody s has today affirmed the cayman islands aa3 government bond and issuer ratings at the same time the rating outlook was maintained at stable today s action reflects the following credit drivers for the cayman islands 1 continued fiscal surpluses that have resulted in low and falling government debt metrics 2 a very high per capita income balanced by the risks posed by a small narrow economy susceptible to weather related shocks 3 a strong institutional framework reflecting broad consensus on macroeconomic policies and supported by fiscal oversight from the uk the cayman islands foreign currency bond ceiling and the long term local currency bond and deposit ceilings all remain unchanged at aa2 the long term foreign currency bank deposit ceiling remains unchanged at aa3 the short term foreign currency bond and foreign currency bank deposit ceilings remain unchanged at p 1 ratings rationale rationale for affirming the aa3 rating first driver fiscal surpluses lead to low and falling government debt burden caymans government has run budget surpluses averaging 2 of gdp since 2013 and we expect continued fiscal surpluses in 2019 and 2020 moody s projects that the continued surpluses will lead to government debt of only 6 4 of gdp this year a fraction of the 39 5 of gdp median for aa rated sovereigns while the debt may rise slightly in 2020 as cayman ramps up public investment projects the rating agency expects continued low debt metrics with a debt burden remaining below 10 of gdp for the next two years second driver high per capita income that balances a small undiversified economy recent updates to national income accounts data place cayman s gdp per capita among the highest of all rated sovereigns moody s estimates cayman s per capita gdp at over 90 000 for 2019 the second highest level for any aa rated sovereign and almost twice the 47 508 peer median the level of wealth is counterbalanced by the scale of the economy with a nominal gdp of only 5 7 billion this year the eighth smallest among all rated sovereigns the cayman islands high level of economic development increases its resilience in the face of economic and natural disaster shocks which is of particular importance given the country s exposure to hurricanes cayman s economy is highly concentrated and tourism and financial services represent over 60 of the island s gdp moody s forecasts that economic growth will average 2 6 in 2019 and 2020 but increased real estate and tourism related investment could result in faster growth over the last two decades many developed nations and international organizations have prioritized reducing tax evasion increasing the risk that sanctions on cayman s financial sector would reduce economic growth in the islands but cayman islands has consistently managed to adjust its laws and regulations and negotiate internaitonal agreements including tax information agreements to reduce this risk moody s expects that cayman will continue to succeed in containing this risk to its economically crucial financial sector third driver a strong institutional framework the cayman islands benefits from decades of stable institutions and respect for the rule of law the cayman s worldwide governance indicators results are among the highest in the region and in the top 20th percentile of all rated sovereigns including highly developed countries a long history of policy consensus and a consistent macroeconomic approach is a key support of its economic development the united kingdom provides further institutional support through fiscal oversight and ultimate judicial review legal limits on government borrowing and oversight from the uk s foreign office have contributed to the decline in public debt in recent years moody s expects that those limits and oversight will remain in place in the next few years outlook cayman s stable outlook indicates that the rating is unlikely to change over the outlook horizon the outlook balances the high level of economic development and low debt metrics against the credit challenges resulting from a small and narrow economic base what could change the rating up a positive outlook could be considered if developments alleviate the constraints that cayman island s small and relatively undiversified economy poses to the sovereign credit profile greater and more diversified economic growth that pushed per capita gdp even higher relative to peers could lead to a positive rating action the buildup of significant fiscal buffers to address any sudden economic shocks and a policy framework that ensures debt levels will remain very low could also result in a positive rating action what could change the rating down a negative outlook could result if the debt burden begins to rise either due to policy reasons sustained weaker growth or both a change to the institutional arrangements that eases current restrictions on excessive debt would also lead to a negative rating action sanctions to the financial sector severe enough to structurally weaken the country s growth prospects or storm related damage to the country s infrastructure beyond historical levels could also lead to a negative rating action gdp per capita us 83 524 2017 actual also known as per capita income real gdp growth change 3 2017 actual also

los angeles business wire kb home nyse kbh today reported results for its first quarter ended february 28 2019 we made continued progress on our returns focused growth plan in the first quarter which contributed to our results including the healthy year over year expansion of our gross margin said jeffrey mezger chairman president and chief executive officer with the balanced allocation of our substantial operating cash flows since the start of our plan in 2016 we have fueled significant growth in our business measurably decreased our debt balance and reduced our shares outstanding we have repaid over 800 million in debt which is producing a tailwind to our gross margin as we spread a lower level of interest across a larger active inventory balance during the first quarter we repaid 230 million of convertible notes which also meaningfully reduced our diluted share count we are beginning to see healthy growth in our average community count which was up 10 in the first quarter continued mezger this increase together with a substantial number of planned openings still to come positions us to capitalize on demand during the spring selling season although the decline in net

not be completely comparable to other companies in the homebuilding industry and thus should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to operating performance and or financial measures

housing construction and land costs excluding 1 housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges as applicable recorded during a given period and 2 amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations by housing revenues the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is housing gross profit margin the company believes adjusted housing gross profit margin is a relevant and useful financial measure to investors in evaluating the company s performance as it measures the gross profits the company generated specifically on the homes delivered during a given period this non gaap financial measure isolates the impact that housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges and the amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing operations have on housing gross profit margins and allows investors to make comparisons with the company s competitors that adjust housing gross profit margins in a similar manner the company also believes investors will find adjusted housing gross profit margin relevant and useful because it represents a profitability measure that may be compared to a prior period without regard to variability of housing inventory impairment and land option contract abandonment charges and amortization of previously capitalized interest associated with housing

kuala lumpur and sydney mar 26 ips the world bank has successfully legitimized the notion that private finance is the solution to pressing development and welfare concerns including achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs through agenda 2030 a recent mckinsey report estimates that the world needs to invest about us 3 3 trillion or 3 8 per cent of world output yearly in economic infrastructure with about three fifths in emerging market and other developing economies to maintain current growth jomo kwame sundaram the world financing gap is about us 350 billion yearly if new commitments such as the sdgs are considered the gap would be about thrice the currently estimated gap as available public resources alone are not enough thus for the bank the success of agenda 2030 depends on massive private sector participation maximizing finance the bank s maximizing finance for development mfd strategy marks a new stage it presumes that most developing countries cannot achieve the sdgs with their own limited fiscal resources and increasingly scarce donor overseas development assistance oda bank prioritization of financial inclusion presumes that fintech powered digital financial inclusion would increase growth create jobs and promote entrepreneurship in developing countries the mfd purports to respond to the g20 s april 2017 principles of mdbs strategy for crowding in private sector finance for growth and sustainable development the g20 has offered the roadmap to infrastructure as an asset class for energy transport and water inter alia the 2017 mfd strategy recycled the bank s 2015 billions to trillions transforming development finance arguing that mdbs should increase financial leverage via securitization to catalyse private investment thus promoting capital markets by transforming bankable projects into liquid securities anis chowdhury the mfd presumes that public money should mainly be used to leverage private finance particularly institutional investments to finance the purported us 5 trillion sdg funding gap financialization coalition the mfd strategy seeks to enable financialization and transition to securities based financial systems in developing countries complementing other initiatives by the bank imf and g20 such initiatives are expected to encourage investors to use environmental social and governance criteria to attract mobilize and sustain needed financing the mfd presumes that public money should mainly be used to leverage private finance particularly institutional investments to finance the funding gap government guarantees are deemed necessary to de risk projects especially for public private partnerships ppps meanwhile the international finance corporation ifc a bank subsidiary is helping subsidize capital market involvement in infrastructure development the mfd strategy envisages capital markets in green bonds social impact bonds infrastructure bonds and so on securities markets are supposed to enable institutional investors to make desirable social and environmental impacts mfd advocates claim that capital markets provide new solutions to development challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and poor access to schooling clean water sanitation and housing the financial stability board has also proposed measures to transform shadow banking into securities based finance while the european commission s sustainable finance initiative seeks to similarly reorient institutional investors and asset managers cascading financialization the bank s cascade approach seeks to institutionalize this bias for private financing it seeks to facilitate securities lending by enabling repo market financing and hedging and rehypothecation i e allowing securities to be used repeatedly for new lending the cascade approach seeks to accelerate financialization with measures to accommodate new asset classes enable banks to engage in securities and derivatives markets with minimal regulation deregulate financial institutions creating tradable assets from ppp projects and facilitate capital flows ostensibly for development it presumes market imperfections and missing markets deter the private sector from financing sustainable development projects and proposes to address such bottlenecks by internalizing externalities and providing subsidies and guarantees to de risk investments tito cordella notes that it prioritizes private finance even when a project is likely to be profitable if undertaken with public funds he notes the tensions between maximizing private financing and optimizing financing for development and some implications public options are only to be considered after all private options are exhausted or fail thus the cascade approach presumes that the private sector is always more efficient despite actual experiences clearly it not only reflects an ideological preference for private finance but also seeks to promote securities and derivatives markets as market liquidity is among the core g20 principles of mdbs strategy for crowding in private sector finance hijacking development finance the strategy would thus commit scarce public resources to de risking such financing arrangements to transform bankable development projects into tradable assets this means that governments will bear more of the likely costs of greater financial fragility and crises such government measures will inadvertently undermine needed financial institutions such as development banks there is no reason to believe that mfd will somehow create the capital market infrastructure to improve finance for smes or needed development transformations once a project s future revenue streams are securitized the multilateral development banks environmental and social safeguards no longer apply contracts to repay securitized debt held by investors would be disconnected from the underlying project financed and its consequences holders of these securities have no incentives to prioritize social or environmental goals private equity and hedge funds that have short term incentives for profit taking including by asset stripping are not concerned with social environmental or other public interests not surprisingly considerable doubt exists as to whether private capital markets and institutional investors can be incentivized to finance long term public goods as these mechanisms serve the profit motive not public welfare anis chowdhury adjunct professor at western sydney university university of new south wales australia held senior united nations positions in new york and bangkok jomo kwame sundaram a former economics professor was assistant director general for economic and social development food and agriculture organization and received the wassily leontief prize for advancing the frontiers of economic thought in 2007

earnings conference call i ll begin the call with an overview and then lee will complete our prepared remarks with additional comments on the financial results fiscal year 2019 was a historic year for conn s and reflects the growing momentum in our business fourth quarter gaap earnings were 29 5 million or 0 91 per diluted share which were the best quarterly earnings we have achieved in our 129 year history adjusted ebitda for fiscal year 2019 was a record 212 8 million a 27 increase from last fiscal year and approximately 18 higher than our previous annual adjusted ebitda record in addition same store sales retail gross margin and bad debt charge offs all improved significantly in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior fiscal year as we start the new fiscal year our focus is on retail growth and we expect to achieve both positive same store sales and accelerated store growth our ability to simultaneously manage retail growth and credit risk is the combination of our business transformation and we are embarking on the next phase of our business plan our strategy is to produce 8 to 10 annual retail sales growth and controlled credit performance which drives a very powerful financial model we believe we can grow at this rate for many years to come and we are extremely excited by the long term opportunity we have in front of us to create sustainable shareholder value so with this introduction let s look at our fourth quarter results in more detail starting with our retail business as we have stated on previous calls we believe our non harvey market performance is the best indicator to use when analyzing our retail business during the quarters impacted by the hurricane i am pleased to report the same store sales for the fourth quarter in non harvey markets were up 3 7 which validates our retail growth initiatives and is in line with our long term expectation of achieving positive low single digit same store sales overall same store sales were down 1 4 for the fourth quarter primarily due to the benefits hurricane harvey rebuilding efforts had in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year same store sales in harvey markets were down 12 9 in the fourth quarter as we mentioned in our third quarter conference call strong novembers sales benefited from higher promotional activity in the large screen tv category this pulled demand forward and sales trends decelerated throughout the fourth quarter in addition we believe the government shutdown also impacted fourth quarter sales trend looking at fiscal year 2019 sales total retail sales were positive for the year ending january 31 2019 which is the first year of positive retail sales growth in three years in addition for fiscal year 2019 non harvey same store sales were down 1 which is close to our long term annual same store sales guidance lease to own sales were 8 1 for the fourth quarter and were an annual record 7 5 for fiscal year 2019 for the month of january 9 2 of retail sales were financed through lease to own programs reflecting the progress we are making toward our 10 lease to own sales goal expanding our product categories is another component of our retail growth strategy during fiscal year 2019 we successfully added gaming systems and robotic vacuums to our assortment and i m pleased to report these new product initiatives performed better than expected we also recently launched new upholstery and dining collection and the initial reaction from our customers has been encouraging during fiscal year 2020 we will continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings with complimentary category that align with our retail and our retail and our credit strategy as a result during the first half of fiscal year 2020 we will begin testing cellphone and flooring products in our stores these large compelling and exciting categories resonate with our customers and support our strategy of adding aspirational home products that our customers can affordably finance we plan on launching new marketing initiatives throughout fiscal year 2020 to help from our expanding product assortment and growing retail presence our product strategy is also benefiting retail gross margin which increased 230 basis points in the fourth quarter to a quarterly record of 42 4 on an annual basis retail gross margin was a record 41 2 and was the first time we have reported annual retail gross margin over 40 we believe our retail gross margin is sustainable as we continue to benefit from our better best product strategy looking at first quarter sales february sales were impacted by the slow start to tax season and lower refunds during the month while the pace of tax refunds has improved and helped march sales we are cautious on first quarter sales due to february slow start in addition harvey continues to impact current sales trends we will begin lapping the impact from harvey rebuilding efforts in the back half of this fiscal year which will help same store sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we are guiding non harvey same store sales in the range of negative 2 to positive 2 and harvey same store sales in the range of negative 12 to negative 8 during fiscal year 2019 we opened a total of seven new stores including stores in texas virginia and louisiana new store revenues and credit performance continue to be in line with our expectation which provides us with increasing confidence in our retail expansion plan with our enhanced credit model in place new stores are ramping at a slower rate as we closely control credit risk we expect sales in new stores to mature to our company average over time which will provide a tailwind to same store sales once new stores build the base of recurring customer from a credit standpoint first payment default rates on originations in our new stores opened between july and december 2018 were nearly 20 lower than first payment default rate on total originations made during the same time period highlighting our ability to prudently manage credit risk as we open new stores for fiscal year 2020 we plan to open 12 to 15 new stores in existing states which will all be in our new store layout featuring an enhanced customer experience and a more efficient sales process to date in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 we have opened a new store in montgomery alabama and a new store in new orleans louisiana we plan to open two more stores in new orleans in the coming months and we are extremely excited about our opportunity in this new market with 125 stores in 14 states we have a significant and long term opportunity to expand our store base in addition to our investments in new stores we plan on opening our new houston distribution center late this summer once operational we expect the state of the art facility to improve our logistics efficiencies across our largest market as we increase new store investment control sales of new locations transition into our new houston d c and make further investments in our i t systems to support our growth we expect some margin degradation will temporarily occur however we expect to leverage these investments as we lap initial costs and grow sales we are excited to execute our retail growth plan and i look forward to sharing our success in the coming quarters now let s take a look at our strong credit performance during the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 our credit segment achieved several milestones during fiscal year 2019 including a record annual net yield of 21 3 and a periodic charge off rate of 12 7 which is in line with our long term annual loss expectation of 12 to 13 this performance helped drive 32 1 million improvement in annual adjusted credit segment operating income which ended the year at 5 7 million versus a loss of 26 4 million last fiscal year in fact this was the best annual adjusted credit segment operating income conn s has produced in five years for fiscal year 2019 conn s credit spread increased to 860 basis points compared to 420 basis points in the prior fiscal year in dollar terms our annual credit spread increased 111 to 131 1 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to 62 2 million for fiscal year 2018 we are closing in on our 1000 basis point annual credit spread target which we expect to achieve this fiscal year for the fourth quarter interest income and fees were a record 85 4 million and increased over 9 from the prior fiscal year period as a result of higher interest rate and better charge off performance this drove a 110 basis point year over year improvement in our net yield which was 21 6 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 higher rates of no interest receivables and charge offs typically occur in the fourth quarter which happened this year and drove a 10 basis point reduction in our net yield compared to the third quarter rate as we have stated previously we believe our portfolio will ultimately achieve our net yield goal of 23 to 25 and we are confident we will produce a 1000 basis point spread during fiscal 2020 recent 60 plus day delinquency trends demonstrate that we have reached credit stabilization as a result of the successful underwriting changes we implemented several years ago as a result we expect delinquency rates to range between 9 to 10 of the total portfolio carrying value which will vary quarter to quarter based on typical seasonal trend our credit results continue to demonstrate better operating performance and favorable credit trend i am confident in the continued strength of our credit platform and our ability to manage risk going forward especially as our retail growth accelerate so to conclude my prepared remarks before i turn the call over to lee fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 results demonstrates the strength of our financial model and a positive evolution of our business we continue to believe our retail model and credit platform can consistently support total annual retail sales growth of 8 to 10 and we believe we are well positioned to achieve this goal in fiscal year 2020 with this let me turn the call over to lee lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks norm consolidated revenues were 433 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 a 3 increase from 420 4 million for the same period last fiscal year gaap net income improved significantly to a record 29 5 million or 0 91 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 3 2 million or 0 10 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year quarter on a non gaap basis adjusting for certain charges and credits and losses from extinguishment of debt net income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 was 0 96 per diluted share compared to 0 56 per diluted share for the same period last fiscal year adjusted ebitda was 67 7 million or 15 6 of total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 57 5 million or 13 7 of

4 the 230 basis points year over year improvement in retail gross margin was a result of the continued benefits of our better best product strategy which is enabled by our strong credit platform retail sg a expense was 87 million an increase of approximately 3 9 million from the same quarter in the prior fiscal year while retail sg a expense as a percentage of revenue deleverage 90 basis points to 25 7 primarily due to costs for new stores and an increase in the corporate overhead allocation as norm previously mentioned we plan on opening 12 to 15 new stores this fiscal year we typically start incurring costs associated with new stores approximately six months ahead of opening and there will be additional expenses incurred throughout the fiscal year as we prepare to open these locations we remain focused on strategies to control as sg a expenses however the company will be making investments in new stores along with continued enhancements to our business platforms to ensure our ability to successfully manage future growth turning now to our credit segment to make it easier for investors to understand our customer accounts receivable and associated credit

primarily due to a yield of 21 6 an increase of 110 basis points from last fiscal year as expected there continues to be no retrospective commissions as a result of higher claim volumes related to the increased severity weather events in addition to lower interest penetration rates and rate changes we continue to actively monitor both our partners and overall insurance performance fourth quarter net annualized charge offs as a percent of the average outstanding balance were 12 7 a 220 basis point improvement over the prior fiscal year it is also important to note that fourth quarter net charge offs declined 6 3 million or 11 2 compared to the prior fiscal year for the fiscal year 2019 net charge offs were 32 8 million or 14 5 lower than last fiscal year our periodic charge off rate is now in line with our long term guidance and as a result we are no longer providing static loss guidance for specific periods of originations we believe we can continue to achieve a periodic loss rate between 12 and 13 as we open new stores and grow retail sales provision for bad debts in the credit segment was 55 4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 an increase of 0 7 million from the same period last fiscal year primarily due to growth of the portfolio the allowance for bad debt and uncollectible interest as a percent of the total portfolio was 13 5 at january 31 2019 which was up 20 basis points from the prior fiscal year period improving our recovery process has been a strategic focus throughout this fiscal year as higher recoveries benefit cash collections and reduce loss rates on our allowance for bad debt for fiscal year 2019 we collected 18 8 million of recoveries almost doubling last fiscal year results of 10 9 million we made progress implementing additional recovery partners during the fourth quarter and we believe we are on track to collect annual recoveries exceeding 20 million in fiscal year 2020 for the month of february recoveries exceeded 2 million which is the strongest month of recoveries we have ever achieved and reflect continued improvement sg a expense in the credit segment for the fourth quarter increased 13 7 versus the same quarter last fiscal year and on annualized basis as a percentage of the average customer portfolio balance was 10 1 compared to 9 2 the increase in credit sg a expense primarily reflects the investments we are making to pursue our compelling recovery opportunity and increase in compensation costs and an increase in the corporate overhead allocation interest expense for the fourth quarter was 15 2 million which was a decrease of 15 5 from the same period last fiscal year as a result of continued year over year deleveraging and reductions in all in cost of funds for the fourth quarter annualized interest expense as a percentage of average portfolio balance was 3 9 compared to 4 8 for the same period last fiscal year average net debt as a percentage of average portfolio balance was approximately 59 4 compared to approximately 69 5 for the same period last fiscal year abs notes currently outstanding include the b and c classes of our 2017 b notes and all classes of our 2018 a note we currently expect to complete two abs transactions during fiscal year 2020 i am pleased with the improvements we made in our capital position during fiscal year 2019 we expect to fund the anticipated growth in our portfolio as a result of new store openings and same store sales growth through internally generated funds and our existing capital sources with this overview norm and i are happy to take your questions operator please open the call up to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brian nagel with oppenheimer and company please proceed with your question brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst hi good morning norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman good morning brain brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst thanks for taking my question first off congrats i know you definitely made significant progress here over the last several quarters inaudible norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thank you brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst the question i have is for both norm and lee with regard to sales growth look there s a lot of trends toward packers ph are trading seemingly trend toward packers out there whether there would be other issues with the government shutdown or et cetera but it still seems as though there s something kind of there s a factor or factors there is sort of holding back which should be better retail sales growth given all the improvements in the business and you ve taken a very analytical approach to had a better address or penetrate your customer so the question i have is if you look at all this what is holding it back right now what can you see that s holding back which should be better underlying sales growth norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman what i would say brian is first when you look at you re right there are a lot of moving parts and a lot of transitory things harvey the lapping of harvey being a significant element and as you look at the same store sales results for the fourth quarter from a harvey standpoint it is down 12 9 which was greater than what we anticipated it to be however as we had shared the non harvey was actually up 3 7 which you have to go back five years to find a same store sales number that s in that range where the companies performed at that level and we saw strong performance in november even december was a strong performance almost 5 same store sales in december january early part of january we saw nice performance in january until the middle part of the month or so early mid part of the month with the government shut down and that obviously and ultimately the end of the day resulted in a 3 7 number up from an non harvey standpoint so i will tell you brian i m very very pleased with the underlying performance because i seen non harvey as the underlying performance and our february tax season is very very important to our customers and if you look at february results we re down about 4 same store sales in february in non harvey harvey was actually down 17 and harvey impacted even more last year because the fact that last year during tax season people had fun to be able to buy our products that they typically wouldn t be able to do during the year so now what we re seeing in march and april if you look at our midpoint our implied midpoint from march and april we re looking just a little bit under 2 for the two month in non harvey and even harvey down only about 6 but if you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter those are the implied numbers for march and april so what i would say is i know there s a lot of noise and moving parts i ve never been more bullish than i am as i sit here today and where our performance is and our long term model as you well know is low single digit same store sales and we were there and exceeded that in the fourth quarter and could it be very close to that we think here in the first quarter and position ourselves with the new store growth as well to really take advantage of our very powerful retail model going forward brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst that s really helpful let me just ask one followup with regard to harvey we ve been talking about the harvey affected market now for a while what is is it simply that i think you may have alluded to this in the prepared comments that following the weather events there was this surge of demand as people replace products within that that has basically inaudible demand going forward or what is i guess first i m really asking what is it with what s the dynamic behind harvey and how should we think about that what has to happen that it will take norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman that s a great question brian so what happens is after the hurricane you within about 30 or 45 day time frame you start to see recovery and increase sales from a replacement standpoint so for us that was in the middle of the third quarter to fourth quarter harvey as everyone knows was a rain event so it stretched out even longer than what you d typically see with a wind event hurricane and so we re lapping through the first quarter that the numbers will start to abate in the first quarter there will still be an impact in the second quarter and then in the third quarter very early in the quarter there might be a little bleed into that but for the most part as the vast majority of that will be lapsed on the rebuilding side now the one area that could linger a little bit and impact we re not talking double digits here but could have a could put some downward pressure in that market is you do pull replacements forward when you have a hurricane so somebody that wouldn t be replacing potentially their refrigerator or their furniture for another year and year and a half are forced to do it because of the hurricanes so you get some pull forward of demand that that will pull downward some downward pressure but nothing like we re seeing here over the this quarter and last quarter brian nagel oppenheimer and co analyst thank you very much best of luck norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thanks brian operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick nelson with stephens inc please proceed with your question rick nelson stephens inc analyst hi thanks good morning want to followup on the retail gross margin record levels and up 160 basis points if you had a mix shift toward what i would think would be lower margin electronics and i d like to get behind what is driving that improvement lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey rick it s lee so as you said rightly so there was a mix shift in with more electronics one of the things that we have done i think an excellent job in credit to the merchandising team is continuing to look at your better stores being getting the right value from our vendors and you ll see that come through so we ve been extremely pleased but even with the mix shift change that you ve seen a higher margin so it s one of the things that we talked about on the call though again we ve done a lot of that so as we go forward obviously it is important for us to continue and we are focused on enhancing the mix with furniture and mattress because obviously that s a higher margin but again i think it is a big hats off to our team here that we were able to produce those margins with this mix norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman there s been a lot of focus on for obvious reasons on the credit side and the investment we ve done from a people standpoint there but we ve made significant investments from a people standpoint on the retail side of the house as well and the merchandising the buying team the effectiveness that team has brought to the table here this past year as far as how they buy who they buy from the programs they have in place with our vendors all have has been accretive and enabled us to achieve the record quarterly gross margin we had this past quarter now as we mentioned we won t we still think we have upside primarily driven by mix going forward but as we said in the prepared comments our business model had a 40 plus retail margin is extremely powerful which is really what our target has been all along to get into that 40 plus margin rate rick nelson stephens inc analyst are you in fact taking any prices up in the store to try to stimulate that margin norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman we are not and we still price we do math minus 10 pricing from an advertising standpoint we still match pricing from price guarantee for anything that s advertised with our major competitors none of that has changed rick rick nelson stephens inc analyst the down payment rate was 2 first ph quarter it s been trending lower for some time now had there been inaudible to drive same store sales and are there credit implications down the line from that strategy norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman no it s not at all an effort to drive same store sales it s really just inherent credit quality it s been a little bit better coming in and depending on the overall credit quality coming in is really what s driving that more than anything rick nelson stephens inc analyst got you and store growth which is really ramping this year if you could speak to the stores that are now opening here i think there were couple in texas you opened a year ago at this time how those are performing versus the store model that you ve got it in your powerpoint page 14 lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey rick it s lee we re very pleased with our store openings and they re in line with our expectations again as we ve talked about stores that are in all of our stores we re opening are in existing states but we do have stores in existing markets and what you see is those stores in the existing markets where we already have advertised and have the brand name we see a higher ramp than what we have sort of our midpoint average range of sales in the first year and then when we re going into new markets even though there are existing states are still new markets obviously a bit of a slower ramp but online expectations and we re very excited as norm talked about on the call with a new store in montgomery alabama now it s a new market and a new store in new orleans and we ve talked about two more stores just very excited about the reception that we re receiving in those markets and again we ve again we re very excited about the new store growth plan that we ve got this year and the reception we believe will get norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman and one final thing on rick is your question is kind of ties to me the question that you had mentioned about the margin i m sorry about the deposit down payment and as we mentioned in the we highlighted it in the script just so that folks who are comfortable with the fact that we are not playing with the credit model to drive retail sales now we we re not going to do it if we re not seeing the return on investment invested capital and the risk is not appropriate and we highlighted that our first payment default for our new markets in the back half of last year are actually 20 lower than the total portfolio which speaks to the fact that the tax we re taking here is a long term one of we can drive same positive same store sales low single digit by what s within our control from a merchandising or retail execution standpoint a marketing standpoint and maintain that credit portfolio in a very stable position and we re not going to vary from that as tempting as sometimes it might be for folks to want us to do that rick nelson stephens inc analyst great good to here thanks and good luck lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks rick operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kyle joseph with jefferies please proceed with your question kyle joseph jefferies llc analyst good morning guys thanks for taking my questions going back to tax refunds you guys talked about the impact on retail sales just looking at the results and guidance it doesn t look like there was an impact on credit but can you just talk about inaudible sort of delays there and impacts on inaudible norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman yes we saw a little bit of an impact more driven because our execution is getting better on the collection side of the house what i would say is we didn t have as good a performance in the last part of february from a collection execution standpoint that we anticipated even though it was stronger performance than prior year but i will tell you that in march with the refunds catching up we re seeing for the two months our performance be end up being where we expected to be overall kyle joseph jefferies llc analyst got it and then lee kind of talked about credit getting approaching the 12 to 13 long term target in terms of losses but looking at your credit guidance for the first quarter it looks very good looks like you guys are guiding toward a provision being down a little bit year over year is that just ongoing lingering strength from the end of the year and you d anticipate it sort of stabilizing going forward particularly in the context that your portfolio is now growing a bit lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes part of that s obviously seasonality in q1 kyle but but again we re very pleased with the credit platform and the results that were receiving there so again don t anticipate any major changes from that perspective kyle joseph jefferies llc analyst got it thanks very much for answering my questions lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks kyle operator thank you our next question comes from line of brad thomas with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst hey good morning norman lee and let me add my congratulations as well on another solid year here norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thanks brad bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst let s hear a couple of questions if i could just to follow up on that dynamic of your forecast for provisions for 1q in dollars the provisions were up a little bit in 4q your portfolio is obviously growing you have a model down in 1q i guess just wanted to follow up on the puts and takes there particularly as you look at what s happening with tax refunds of late lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes brad it s lee so again obviously q1 you get the tax refunds that come in and again with this norm talked about the better collections execution so therefore less charge offs so that s really what s going to drive our from our projection when we put our guidance to lower provision here so norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman that s the 2 million in recovery lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer it s true absolutely norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman we mentioned in february that we re really starting to get traction there as well so that s a nice tailwind for us as well from a credit standpoint bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst got you ok and then as we think about sg a obviously you ll be opening up stores here and incur some costs ahead of when those stores actually are open in the fourth quarter sg a dollars up almost 8 it looks like maybe in 1q what s implied is it might not grow at quite that high of a rate but at a high level is that what you think we should be thinking about here kind of a mid maybe high single digit growth rate in sg a dollars for the year norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman yes i think that s directionally correct brad what i would say is we have to get to the point of where we lap the consistent number of new stores that s really not the only driver but it s probably 70 of the driver of that sg a cost lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer yes brad that s right and obviously as norm talked about until we start lapping the number of new stores but one other thing that we did talk about on the call we are making our investments in new systems which we re extremely excited about we will get leverage on the future but that obviously had some costs but again some of the things that we re doing from sg a perspective we talk about the new stores and the importance of execution of those obviously we re hiring managers and training that are in our existing stores so that we can have existing managers and go staff the new stores because it s so important to get good execution from the new stores all of those do add some incremental costs that are important and they re the right investments to make but that s again as we talk about the sg a increase that s what s driving some of those things bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst yes and just if i kind of triangulate here you all obviously don t give explicit earnings guidance for quarters or for the annual basis but when i think about the credit seasoning tailwind that you still have that confidence in the 1000 basis point spread when i look at your implied guidance for 1q it does look like we should have earnings higher year over year in 1q and i would think we should get that in just about every quarter of this year with what you know today do you think that s a reasonable way of looking at the business norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman we clearly don t like to guide beyond the quarter we re in but i think that s a very reasonable way to look at the business lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer brad the one thing to keep in mind obviously we ve talked about it as we grow the portfolio we do have to take that allowance set up fronts of that again add with growth you do get some hit to your credit from that perspective norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman from the provision lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer from the provision exactly bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst great and if i could squeeze one more in from a product perspective is it the furniture mattress category did see some acceleration from 3q into 4q but performance in that category a little bit below some other areas of the store i guess can you talk about what s going on in there any other opportunities are you still pleased with the switch that you made from the temper products over to the sort of siemens ph products anymore color would be great norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman yes i mean we are still pleased with the transition that we made we are seeing a little more softness on the mattress side than we are on the furniture side when you look at the two categories but frankly we feel as much of it is on from a retail execution standpoint and we have the ability to impact that so our expectation going forward is those categories are bread and butter and both mattress and furniture and leaders force and we re looking for improved performance there going bradley thomas key banc capital markets inc analyst very helpful thank you guys norm miller president chief executive officer and chairman thanks brad lee a wright executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brad operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr miller for any final comments norm miller president

recent high of 3 23 per cent in early october the prospects of slowing global economic growth has motivated investors to rebalance their holdings as they digest the new reality said marina severinovsky investment strategist at schroders we re sort of coming back to earth central banks have been positioning themselves to deal with the slowdown she said and that includes the federal reserve s expectations for no rate increases this year earlier this month the european central bank said it would push back the earliest date for interest rate increases it also said it would offer ultra cheap loans to banks supporting their ability to keep lending it s very positive that not just the fed but other policy makers have acknowledged the situation is kind of dangerous on the global

gold prices have seen an increasing trend over the past few years almost tripling between 2007 and 2011 gold has grown by nearly 300 in the past 15 years as demand from investors and central banks has risen as a safe haven the idea of investing in gold is based on two hypotheses the continuous erosion of the purchasing power of paper currencies and the low supply of gold as demand rises leading to higher prices investment methods in gold vary including the conventional method such as bullion and pounds and investment funds such as the etf fund mining companies through the acquisition of shares futures contracts and gold deposit certificates and finally the forex market which refers to the foreign exchange fx market ragab hamed the ceo of sabayik al kuwait said that gold is a popular investment currency for all the community which is the best type of investment he added that it fits with all categories of society according to the purchasing power of each category in different forms such as gold jewellery gold bullion pounds of gold or used gold hamed pointed out that gold is one of the safe havens such as real estate and savings certificates but it is the best for easy buying and selling and easy to transfer and keep the customer may have investments in retail estate as prices rise in banks certificates as interests rise or through projects however during problematic times investors will not keep them or guarantee their money as even banks can go bankrupt furthermore he added that gold differs from other havens in that it retains its value especially when other investments fall due to the effects of local or global economic crises the price of gold always rises in economic crises while the purchasing value of currencies collapses during times of crises he stressed that gold has a robustness a nature that allows it to survive and retain its form and value in harsh environments such as burials fires earthquakes and floods moreover he pointed out that gold is one of the most important reserves of central banks so they will not leave its prices to collapse which nominates it to be one of the safest havens ashraf ibrahim an economic researcher said that the tendency of citizens to put their money in bank savings and investments does not save the value of money because of the low interest rates compared to price hikes he added that the interest rate is up to 15 while price rises may reach 20 25 so the value of savings decrease ibrahim explained that gold is the most appropriate investment vessel for several reasons including the general trend of gold to gradually increase in price he noted that customers should retain gold for at least three months to earn profits over and above he pointed out that there are expectations that gold prices will continue to rise in the coming period due to the possible decline of the dollar as the relationship between the dollar and gold is an inverse relationship he added that the possibility of a drop in the dollar is due to the offensive bases pursued by president donald trump which is isolating the united states and pushes most industrialised countries to sign bilateral agreements to exchange currencies instead of the dollar these policies may also generate a new global crisis because they repeat the same decisions that were the main cause of the 2009 crisis he pointed out that at the time of crisis investors avoid dollars and turn their money into gold the scarcity of gold and its limited natural resources enhance its value and make it one of the most important safe investments said youssef ezzat an economist at arab forex he added that the investors turn to gold during times of crises to save the value of money as a hedge tool moreover he explained that gold is a saving and an investment at the same time as it saves the value of funds and earns profits and gains for investors pointing out that the investment in gold is through several methods including hoarding gold in the form of gold or alloys and coins or investing in gold mining companies through purchasing shares the fx market is another way to trade gold which is very similar to currency trading by buying shares on the exchange alaa eddine farhan managing director and consultant for global markets and manager of golden wave fx said that gold is the best safe haven so many central banks have moved to strengthen their gold reserves to boost the strength of their economies such as china india and russia farhan added that it is the best savings pot that preserves the value of money and investing in gold is in two ways either by saving raw gold in the form or jewellery which is low in risk and low in profits or through investing through fx or the so called buy from the screen which is trading in the global market by opening an account with an intermediary furthermore he explained that investing through fx involves risks and requires careful handling and investors should avoid risking investing 10 of their capital

brazil 55 years after the army staged a coup on 31 march 1964 and overthrew president joao goulart the new far right president jair bolsonaro has announced a celebration of this sad event there can be no doubt about the active support provided by the us government the world bank and the imf on 2 april 2014 a us ngo the national security archive nsa publicized an impressive amount of declassified official documents that testify to washington aiding and abetting the brazilian army officers who had overthrown joao goulart s democratic governement 50 years earlier see in the phd dissertation i presented at the universities of paris viii and liège in 2004 i discussed the support provided to the coup by washington the wb and the imf the relevant section is reproduced below support for the brazilian military junta after the overthrow of president joao goulart president joao goulart s democratic government was overthrown by the military in april 1964 wb and imf loans suspended for three years resumed very soon afterwards a brief time line in 1958 brazilian president kubitschek was about to undertake negotiations with the imf to gain access to a loan of 300 million dollars from the united states at the end kubitschek refused the imf imposed conditions and did without the us loan this earned him wide popularity his successor goulart announced that he would implement a radical land reform programme and proceed to nationalise petroleum refineries he was overthrown by the military the united states recognised the new military regime one day after the coup not long afterwards the wb and imf resumed their suspended lending policy as for the military they rescinded the economic measures the united states and imf had criticised note that international financial institutions were of the view that the military regime was taking sound economic measures yet the gdp fell 7 in 1965 and thousands of firms declared wbruptcy the regime organised harsh repression outlawed strikes caused a dramatic drop in real wages and eliminated direct ballot voting disbanded trade unions and made systematic use of torture president joao goulart s democratic government was overthrown since his first trip in may 1968 mcnamara regularly visited brazil where he did not miss meeting the military rulers the public reports of the wb systematically praised the policies of the dictatorship in reducing inequalities nevertheless inside the wb the discussions took a bitter turn when bernard chadenet vice president of project of the wb declared that the image of the wb is going to degrade following the support to the repressive government of brazil mcnamara recognized that there was a tremendous amount of repression but he added that it is not necessarily a great deal different from what it had been under previous governments and it did not seem to be a lot worse than in some other member countries of the wb is brazil worse than thailand some days later mc namara followed up no viable alternative to the government by generals seemed open the world wb realised very well that inequalities would not diminish and that its loans in the agricultural sector would reinforce the big landowners nevertheless it decided to carry on the loans because it absolutely wanted to put the government under its influence now at this juncture the wb met an obvious failure the military regime demonstrated a deep mistrust in the context of the wbs desire to increase his presence finally at the end of the 70s they took advantage of a profusion of loans from the international private bankers granted at a lower rate of interest than that of the wb and moved away from the wb which they found less useful how political and geostrategical considerations influence world wb lending policy article iv section 10 stipulates the wb and its officers shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members concerned only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions and these considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purposes set by the wb stated in article i the wb has found many systematic means of getting round the prohibiting its operations taking political and non economic considerations into account one of the primary stipulations of its charter from its founding onwards the wb refused loans to post liberation france as long as the communists remained in the government the day after they left the government in may 1947 the loan france had requested blocked until then was granted the wb has repeatedly contravened article iv of its own statutes in truth the wb has made many choices based on political considerations the quality of governments economic policies is not the determining element in its choices the wb has often lent money to the authorities in countries despite the dismal quality of their economic policies and a great degree of corruption indonesia and zaire are two cases in point specifically wb choices relative to countries that play a major political role in the eyes of its major shareholders are regularly linked to these shareholders interests and outlooks starting with the united states from 1947 to the collapse of the soviet bloc world wb and imf decisions were determined in large part by the following criteria avoid shoring up self reliant models provide funding to large scale projects wb or policies imf enabling major industrialised countries to increase exports refuse to help regimes seen as a threat by the united states government or other important shareholders attempt to modify the policies of certain governments in the so called socialist countries so as to weaken the cohesion of the soviet bloc this is why support was granted to yugoslavia which had dropped out of the moscow dominated bloc from 1948 or to romania from the 1970s at the time when ceaucescu was attempting to take his distances from the comecon and the warsaw pact support strategic allies of the western capitalist bloc and in particular of the us i e indonesia from 1965 to the present day mobutu s zaire the philippines under marcos brazil under the dictators after the 1964 coup dictator somoza s nicaragua apartheid south africa attempt to avoid or to limit in so far as possible closer links between third world countries and the soviet bloc or china for example distancing the ussr from india and sukarno era indonesia to carry out this policy the world wb and the imf have generalised a tactic greater flexibility towards right wing governments less demanding in terms of austerity measures facing a strong left opposition than to left wing governments facing strong opposition from the right concretely that means ifi are more demanding and make life more difficult for left wing governments to weaken them and ease the right s path to power according to the same logic the ifi have made fewer demands on right wing governments facing a left wing opposition to avoid weakening them and preventing the left from coming to power monetarist orthodoxy has variable geometrics the variations depend on many political and geostrategic factors the imf and world wb did not hesitate to support dictatorships when they and other major capitalist powers found it opportune the author of the world report on human development published by undp 1994 edition says so in black and white but rhetoric is running far ahead of reality as a comparison of the per capita oda received by democratic and authoritarian regimes shows indeed for the united states in the 1980s the relationship between aid and human rights has been perverse multilateral donors also seem not to have been bothered by such considerations they seem to prefer martial law regimes quietly assuming that such regimes will promote political stability and improve economic management after bangladesh and the philippines lifted

slowing roiled wall street friday triggering a sell off in stocks that erased the market s gains for the week by damian j troise and alex veiga ap business writers wall street was roiled friday by new signs that global economic growth is slowing the jitters triggered a sell off in stocks and sent bond yields sharply lower flashing a possible recession warning the wave of selling knocked 460 points off the dow jones industrial average and gave the benchmark s p 500 index its worst day since jan 3 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell more than the rest of the market as traders

the slide in bond yields hurt bank stocks which along with technology companies accounted for much of the broad decline in stocks the utilities sector was the only one to eke out a gain what s really giving investors concern today is this weak global economic data here in the u s and in europe said jeff kravetz regional investment director for u s bank wealth management the market s skid runs counter to what has been a strong start to the year on wall street as stocks rebounded from a steep slide at the end of 2018 the bull market for u s stocks recently marked its 10th anniversary and is now the longest ever the fear that gripped investors friday was fueled by a steadily dimming outlook for the global economy china the world s second largest economy after the united states is weakening and other economies that depend heavily on purchases in china have suffered as a result factory production in the euro currency alliance has fallen at its steepest rate in about six years in germany europe s largest economy a survey of purchasing manager manufacturers posted its sharpest production drop in nearly six years orders to german factories have also tumbled in another worrying

the discussion over to phil f philip snow chief executive officer thanks rima and good morning to everyone we closed the first half of our fiscal year on a solid note we continued our track record of steady growth with increases to our topline and bottom line as well as operating margin improvement we executed well against our strategy of providing smarter connected data and technology solutions and saw positive results across all our businesses our broadening suite of innovative solutions continued to resonate with the market we re laser focused on working with our clients to drive efficiency in their processes and delivering content and analytics in new ways all while providing factset s best in class service we re encouraged by an increasing number of high level conversations with our largest clients regarding our entire solution set as they navigate a challenging economic backdrop in our second quarter we increased our organic asv and professional services at a growth rate of 6 organic revenue also grew over 6 and adjusted operating margin came in at 33 2 180 basis point improvement year over year we re pleased with our overall cost discipline allowing us to improve our margin and make meaningful progress toward our goal of 100 basis points improvement for the year adjusted diluted eps increased 14 to 2 42 primarily due to stronger operating results turning to asv analytics and cts were the main drivers this quarter along with the annual price increase for our americas clients both analytics and cts have been sources of growth for several years due to the competitive strength of our analytics suite and the increasing demand for high quality integrated data in the marketplace within analytics our core portfolio analytics suite had a strong quarter and provided our sales team with many opportunities to increase asv with existing clients analytics drove the majority of the increase this quarter cts was the second largest contributor in the second quarter as it continues to increase its sales of core data feeds such as factset fundamentals and within the open factset marketplace data exploration is removing friction from the trial and evaluation process to evaluate content wealth also had a positive quarter as it continues to expand and take market share the branch rollout at merrill is complete and was successfully implemented in under six months we believe the wealth team has a growing number of significant opportunities in this space within research we saw a healthy increase in users on the sell side additionally we saw growth of our rms solutions across both the buy side and sell side we re also pleased with the results of the detailed banking sector data we rolled out last quarter we ve more than doubled the users for this new content and plan to add new content in other sectors lastly our overall cancellation rate remains stable this quarter versus a year ago looking at our americas and international businesses americas delivered a solid growth rate of 6 driven by our leading analytics and expanded cts offering we also see an increase in enterprise discussions across our client base for our workforce solutions the emea region grew 4 this quarter primarily as a result of analytics and cts cancellations in one market drove a decrease in the growth compared with the first quarter of 2019 we have a good pipeline for the second half of the year and we believe we will reach our goals for this region in asia pac we hit a strong second quarter with analytics and cts again as the main drivers followed by research resulting in an 11 growth rate for the region additionally the cancellation rate in asia pac is also trending positive we believe we have significant opportunities in various markets in asia pac especially with cts and analytics as we close the first half of the year we re pleased with our financial metrics and progress on asv relative to last year at the same time we remain cautious as client cost pressures remain for the second half of the year we ll continue to execute on our 2019 goals and are making good progress integrating our products bring seamless investment portfolio lifecycle platform and enhancing our risk offering and unbundling our products to provide open and flexible solutions our broad suite of offerings is resonating well with clients who are looking to increase productivity through smarter connected data and gives us confidence in our growth trajectory as i ve said before it s important to look at our company performance on a half yearly basis we anticipate that our growth for the full fiscal year could be more concentrated toward our fourth quarter we reaffirm our outlook for 2019 and look forward to a successful second half now let me turn the call over to helen to talk in more detail about our financial results helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer thank you phil and good morning everyone it s great to be here with all of you again we delivered a solid second quarter both organic revenue and organic asv plus professional services grew at 6 we expanded our gaap and adjusted operating margins year over year and grew adjusted diluted eps by 14 as i go through this quarter s results please keep in mind that our gaap net income and eps in the second quarter of our prior fiscal year were impacted by one time past expenses related to u s tax reform i ll expand on this a little later when i report out on the tax rate i will now walk us through our second quarter gaap and organic revenue increased 6 to 355 million and 357 million respectively versus the prior year the growth was driven primarily by analytics cts and wealth note that our solid first quarter asv results are a contributor as prior period asv is more fully recognized as revenue in the second quarter for our geographic segment americas revenue grew 7 and international revenue grew 4 organically americas benefited from an increase in wealth analytics and cts and international revenue was largely driven by analytics and cts asv plus professional services increased to 1 44 billion at the end of our second quarter at a growth rate of 6 year over year and 21 million since the end of our first quarter the growth was primarily driven by analytics and cts and reflects our annual price increase in the americas the price impact was approximately 10 million in line with prior year adjusted operating margin increased by 33 2 a 180 basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2018 this expansion is driven in part by tighter expense management and increased productivity some of this improvement comes from the restructuring efforts we took in prior quarters and a continued mix of resources between higher and lower cost regions favorable movement in foreign exchange rates were a notable driver as the dollar strengthened against some of the currencies we are most exposed to such as the pound sterling the euro and the indian rupee we believe that we remain on target to achieve the 100 basis point margin expansion for the full year operating expenses for the second quarter totaled 246 million an increase of 3 over the prior year this increase is lower than our revenue growth and as a result we were able to expand our operating margin as a percentage of revenue the expense improvement came from our cost of services which was positively impacted by lower compensation expense and a decrease in data costs these reductions were partially offset by higher technology costs supporting our infrastructure spend additionally the higher productivity from the restructuring actions taken last year continues to have a favorable impact on cost of service sg a expenses expressed as a percentage of revenue were in line with the prior year lower discretionary spend in marketing and office expenses were partially offset by higher compensation and bad debt expense our tax rate for the quarter was 18 8 impacted by a one time settlement with tax authorities excluding this discreet item our tax rate would be 17 6 in the second quarter of our fiscal 2018 our tax rate was 42 4 reflecting the one time toll tax that we had to pay on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of the u s tax reform excluding this and other discreet items the effective tax rate for the period was also 17 6 gaap eps increased 65 to 2 19 this quarter versus 1 33 in the second quarter of 2018 this increase is attributable to higher revenue improved margins a lower effective tax rate and to a lesser extent lower share count offset by higher interest expense last year s eps was negatively impacted by 0 57 due to the aforementioned toll tax adjustment adjusted diluted eps grew 14 to 2 42 a reconciliation of our adjustment to gaap eps is disclosed at the end of our press release free cash flow which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was 87 million for the quarter an increase of 1 over the same period last year primarily due to higher net income and partially offset by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures we increased the net number of new clients this quarter versus the prior quarter by 108 resulting in a total of over 5 400 clients the drivers of the growth were mainly due to an increase in corporate and wealth management clients looking at our share repurchase program for the second quarter we repurchased 215 000 shares for 44 million at an average share price of 205 we have 137 million remaining in our share repurchase program and we remain committed to buying back shares at a steady pace and continue to balance our capital allocation between business investments and shareholder returns we are changing our guidance for a few metrics first we are lowering our annual effective tax rate for the full year it is now expected to be between 17 18 second we are tightening our gaap diluted eps guidance to be between 8 70 and 8 85 and our adjusted diluted eps guidance to be in the range of 9 50 and 9 65 cents there is no change to our annual guidance for gaap revenues organic asv plus professional services and gaap and adjusted operating margins in summary we are pleased with our quarter and with our first half results where we had over 6 growth in both revenue and organic asv plus professional services and adjusted operating margin of 32 4 and a 15 increase in adjusted diluted eps we continue to demonstrate successful execution against our strategy both client collaboration and service and on disciplined cost management as we look ahead to the remainder of this fiscal year we will make investments that drive business growth to streamline our cost structure and to return long term value to our shareholders so with that we are now ready for your questions stephanie questions and answers operator at this time i d like to remind everyone in order to ask a question please press then the no 1 on your telephone keypad we ll pause for a moment to compile the q a roster your first question comes from manav patnaik with barclays please go ahead gregory r bardi barclays investment bank analyst hi this is greg calling on for manav i just wanted to ask about the sales pipeline in a couple ways just wondering if there were any delayed buying decisions in the second quarter given what we saw in december and then also a little bit of the rationale for why the growth will be tilted toward the fourth quarter f philip snow chief executive officer hey greg it s phil snow so i don t think we saw anything noticeable in terms of delays as a result of what happened in december nothing measurable that i can point to and as i said in my script we really do think about our business in halves when we look at the pipeline in any given year it s typically much more heavily weighted toward q4 and this year is no different gregory r bardi barclays investment bank analyst okay and then on the margin side pretty nice results we had always thought of the margins as being a steady tick up every quarter but the second quarter was already above your guidance so any color on timing that happened in the third quarter or how we should think about the margin trajectory from here thanks helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer yeah sure thank you for your question i ll take that this is helen we re very comfortable with where we are for the first half of the year it really was driven by things that we ve been executing on which is good discipline on discretionary spend on employee productivity improvement which we ve seen from as we noted the employee mix as well as some of the actions that we ve taken over the previous quarters and then also we ve benefited from foreign exchange favorable rates largely exposed to the ones that we re most open to which is the pound the euro and the rupee as we think about it going forward we re just going to continue to execute on the same plan on getting operational efficiencies and so that gives us comfort of being able to meet our target for the year and to be within the range that we ve given you guidance on any other questions operator your next question comes from peter heckmann with davidson please go ahead peter heckmann d a davidson co analyst good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions phil i was curious on the m a front it ll be almost two years since the company s last acquisition are you when you look at the marketplace are you changing some of your thoughts about organic versus nonorganic growth or is there something else like valuations that s keeping you from closing deals f philip snow chief executive officer yeah it s a great question so i think i d just start with we did make a number of acquisitions within a couple of years more software so we intentionally decided to pause and really get those integrated and i think what you re going to see in the second half of this year is some real new exciting products coming out from factset within the analytics and trading space and we re already beginning to monetize some of those so that s been a big focus for us when we think about m a we re always looking at everything that s out there in the market there isn t a deal that gets done that typically doesn t come across our desk and i think we re always interested in content factset does an exceptional job at integrating content monetizing content but yeah the high valuations don t help we don t want to overpay for anything but we are continuing to scan the market for interesting tuck in opportunities peter heckmann d a davidson co analyst gotcha and then can you comment on the burton taylor study which came out recently it talked about an estimate of 2018 data growth of the market of about 5 5 in constant currency and about 10 for data streams both of those pretty much matched your asv growth for fiscal 18 and i guess that s a difference from historical patterns where factset grew faster than the market any comment there in terms of your perception of maybe their forecast versus your performance f philip snow chief executive officer so i haven t had a close look at that yet peter i think we don t address the entire market so there may be some segments of the market that are growing faster than the segments that we address that doesn t mean that we can t get into those markets but i don t think i can give you a great answer until i ve looked at that in more detail what i can say is that when we re facing the competitors that we re facing in the markets that we serve today i see that we re winning more than losing so i think for the pieces that burton taylor report that factset that s our addressable market we re doing well in that piece of it peter heckmann d a davidson co analyst all right thank you f philip snow chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley please go ahead toni kaplan morgan stanley co analyst good morning thank you i wanted to ask about margins as well so just given the strong results in the quarter i was a bit surprised that maybe you didn t raise the operating margin guidance for the year is there anything that specifically held you back from raising it was there anything one time in the quarter that led you to stay where you were thanks helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer sure thanks toni for your question so i think there s a couple things to consider when we talk about some of the operational efficiencies we ve achieved we take that all into consideration that puts us above 32 for q2 which is an increase both quarter over quarter year over year basis as well as sequentially but i think the foreign exchange favorable rates also added about a point which works well when it works your way but we re not in the business of trying to forecast going forward so when we look at the first half at 32 4 which shows real good progress as we ve made against our target to us that feels like the right place for us to be and as we operate going forward we don t we re going to continue to make the right long term decisions for the growth of the business and not necessarily trying to manage to a margin toni kaplan morgan stanley co analyst okay great and then you mentioned how strong analytics was this quarter and it follows the lighter first quarter so did something change or was it more timing related or any additional color you can give on that would be helpful f philip snow chief executive officer sure well toni this is phil so again it s a tale of two halves in the first half we re typically much more heavily weighted to the second quarter obviously we had that significant deal in q1 of this year but on the analytics side we did very well with our core pa product traditional pa the seats grew a lot of what was driving that was new risk clients that we ve closed and some more enterprise deals that are actually then resulting in more pa deployment within clients and we were positive on both the risk and fixed income side in terms of driving asv toni kaplan morgan stanley co analyst thank you f philip snow chief executive officer yep operator your next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs please go ahead george tong goldman sachs group inc analyst hi thanks good morning organic revenue growth in the quarter decelerated a bit to 5 7 from 6 4 in the prior quarter despite easier comps in the year ago period can you just elaborate on which areas of the business contributed to this deceleration and how you can expect trends to change as you move through the year f philip snow chief executive officer so if you re talking about the quarter over quarter growth i think we had that very large wealth deal in q1 so i think that s on a quarter to quarter basis that s skewing the numbers on a year over year basis i believe we re pretty much comparable to last year so the 5 9 6 and right in the middle of our guidance range for the year so we re reaffirming our annual guidance from an asv standpoint and feel good about that range helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer and really we want to we look at as phil mentioned first half we look at the first half as opposed to just the quarter so i think that s probably another way you should think about it as well george tong goldman sachs group inc analyst got it and then you previously indicated that visibility into large deals should improve as you move through the year can you provide us an update on the progress of these large deal conversions how this compares with your internal expectations and when you may be in the position to update guidance to reflect progress with these larger deals f philip snow chief executive officer yeah so i think we have good visibility now in the second half typically we re it s not clear to us more than six months out on some of that stuff so based on what we see in the pipeline for the large deals we re reaffirming our guidance for the year around the midpoint of the guidance operator your next question comes from shlomo rosenbaum with stifel please go ahead shlomo rosenbaum stifel nicolaus company inc analyst hi hi good morning thank you for taking my questions helen i just wanted to make sure i understood you correctly of the margin expansion year over year of 180 basis points around 100 is from currency and 80 is from actions that the company took on its own between restructuring better use of resources efficiency mix of where work is done and stuff like that is that right helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer yes i think you that is correct shlomo rosenbaum stifel nicolaus company inc analyst okay and then just can you talk a little bit about what was going on internationally usually i expect international organic revenue growth to be faster than americas and i thought there was some kind of comment about a cancellation or something is can you give a little bit more detail as to what s going on over there f philip snow chief executive officer yeah hey shlomo it s phil so we actually had a very good quarter in the u k but there was one market on the continent where we had a significant cancel that accounts for the majority of the difference there that you were seeing in the emea region and i believe we accelerated our growth in asia pac slightly this quarter we had a good quarter in asia pac shlomo rosenbaum stifel nicolaus company inc analyst was the cancel a loss or what was going on over there it s competitive loss i mean f philip snow chief executive officer yeah we don t give a lot of detail on the cancellations so it was a significant step backwards yep shlomo rosenbaum stifel nicolaus company inc analyst got it okay i ll get back in the queue thanks f philip snow chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from hamzah mazari with macquarie please go ahead hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst good morning thank you my first question is just around the client environment i know you mentioned client cancellations are stable but any thoughts as to where you think we are in terms of buy side consolidation and maybe just in relation to that if you could just talk about has it been negative for you or positive for you as you look at the consolidation that s already occurred f philip snow chief executive officer yeah hamzah it s phil so i m not sure exactly where we are i think that as we look further out we re going to see continued cost pressures for the clients in some cases consolidation does help factset we ve got great relationships with our clients very often it forces the new combined entity to sit down and look at everything they have and we have a much broader suite of solutions now that we can offer clients so obviously there s cost pressure when firms consolidate they re looking for efficiency so it s a mixture of things but this is an environment that we re used to operating in now and i m so pleased with how we ve performed and all of the products that we have coming to market i continue to feel like there s more new and interesting product coming out from factset than we ve ever had and even in an economic backdrop which is difficult i feel that we have a good chance of really continuing to take good market share hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst got it and just to follow up you had mentioned unbundling of products to provide more open solutions it just any thoughts as to what that means where you are in that unbundling process thank you f philip snow chief executive officer sure so i ve talked about this a little bit before but we re no longer just a workstation product factset has done a lot of investment in our technology stack and that s allowed us to do a lot of interesting stuff so one is we have this great new web product which we re beginning to monetize in wealth and other markets a result of that is we re actually able to break up pieces of that if we wanted to and deploy those interesting ways which we re already doing we re opening up more apis to our clients so a good example is our analytics api if you wanted to take the engine that power pa and plug into your own system we can help you with that now and then of course we have our open factset marketplace which is another example of us delivering content in new and interesting ways so i d say we re at the beginning of that journey of unbundling we think that s the way the world is going and we re that s the way we re going as well hamzah mazari macquarie capital analyst gotcha thank you operator your next question comes from peter appert with piper jaffray please go ahead peter appert piper jaffray co analyst thanks thank you so phil the change in ownership of thomson s f r business is a pretty dramatic change in the competitive landscape any commentary in terms of anything you re seeing in terms of that change maybe specifically in terms of an opportunity or threat or even more broadly in terms of the competitive universe f philip snow chief executive officer thanks peter so i don t think much has changed there so we ve been competing with thomson and reuters in some way shape or form for a couple of decades now we continue to feel good about our product offering versus theirs in the markets that we compete in and i think i haven t seen much of a change to date in terms of how they are coming to market peter appert piper jaffray co analyst okay and then helen i think you said you made a comment about not managing to margin which i think is consistent with what the company has said historically but that said given your tenure now at this point do you have a thought in terms of what you think maybe the appropriate level of the margin for the factset business is longer term helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer yeah thanks for your question i can only use my early tenure for so long but i think what we re seeing right now is that we continue to have opportunities on the operational front i think as i noted we really need to think about our long term growth we already are making investments back into the business whether it s on infrastructure or on product on even facilities so from my perspective i don t know that i have a particular target i do think we continue to have operational productivity improvements that we can make peter appert piper jaffray co analyst okay thank you helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald please go ahead andrew gutman cantor fitzgerald co analyst hi this is drew gutman on for joe you mentioned earlier the merrill deal is done i was wondering if you could touch on any color around how that process went and if you re seeing any flow through into the model already f philip snow chief executive officer yes hey drew it s phil so the process went exceptionally well so we did it in under six months i ve heard that deployments of that scale historically were sometimes two or three times that long so we feel really good about how efficient we were there in terms of deploying the product i myself actually went and observed one of the advisors getting trained and that was a real thrill for me to see their reaction to our product versus what they had and our team was amazing so we had a lot of our existing factset consultants go out and do this and did a phenomenal job all the feedback we got was exceptional our pipeline is building for other deals like this and we feel really good about this as a new market for us and one that we think will be core to our business moving forward andrew gutman cantor fitzgerald co analyst great and then in terms of the americas it looks like you guys keep having some strong strength there could you maybe touch on a little more detail about the demand there and what you see moving forward f philip snow chief executive officer yeah so it s our americas team had a really good first half i think you saw our banking number too so that s being driven globally but we re seeing really good growth in our users on the sell side which might surprise some people but we have a great product our deep sector strategy is paying off we released that in october of last year and we have thousands of users using that data already so it s picking up momentum very quickly andrew gutman cantor fitzgerald co analyst great thank you f philip snow chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from bill warmington with wells fargo please go ahead william warmington wells fargo securities analyst good morning everyone f philip snow chief executive officer hey bill william warmington wells fargo securities analyst so i just wanted to ask the employee count was down quarter to quarter while the user count was up so it would imply that perhaps the ramp in the b of a business required less implementation staff than we had expected maybe that it s ultimately higher margin business than we first thought is that a great way to think about that helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer i ll take the first part of that question when you think about our employee growth rate over time on an organic basis i think it is important to look in the past there s been acquisitions right that help drive that growth rate but overall it is down but in part if you think about the fact that we do have a larger base of employees too so i think we have to be careful about just looking at the rate i also think that we have become more productive whether it s in content or in engineering so we ve been able to use automation and technology to be able to drive greater productivity and also keep in mind we do have some restructuring actions that we had taken in previous quarters and so when you stop looking comparatively that s also going to make an impact as we think about total numbers i don t know that we would tie it back specifically with what we ve done with baml we had folks as we ve always talked about this was an organic deal so we had people who were working overall focused their efforts on the baml win which was very successful and so as that winds and completes they will refocus their efforts on new business william warmington wells fargo securities analyst okay and second question is longer term the organic asv growth is running around 6 the margins are in the process of rebounding to the mid 30s historically because of the competitive environment there s a need to reinvest in r d and customer service and keep those margins around there so mathematically with the 6 growth and without margin expansion how do you maintain double digit eps growth helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer i ll take the first shot at that so thank you for your question i think for us we re continuing as you even note to invest back in the business phil talked new products and the open nature of our products that we re putting to market so that will drive i think growth we continue to use cash as we think about capital allocations to also buy back shares and that will help as well as we think about returning value to shareholders so i think those are all the different levers that we will look at to continue on our performance william warmington wells fargo securities analyst got it all right well thank you very much helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer you re welcome thanks for your question operator your next question comes from tim mchugh with william blair please go ahead timothy mchugh william blair company analyst yes thanks i just wanted to know if you could elaborate on the sell side i know you mentioned some of the new product there but i guess how much is that the wealth management deal how much are you just seeing hiring i guess within some of your investment banking clients maybe just elaborate i guess what s driving the sell side asv to such a strong number lately f philip snow chief executive officer sure tim it s phil so actually just one point of clarification is the wealth business we put in the buy side so none of the wealth users or the baml users are included in the sell side number so we re really driving a lot of new seats in banking i think that might ve been up by well over 1 000 in this quarter and we had one significant deal in asia pac as well that actually used our web platform so we were able to deploy that very easily to a large number of users in the asia pacific region so i think it s just a combination of the excellent software we have for banking and all of the investment that we re making in content for those users timothy mchugh william blair company analyst okay great and then within europe you talked about the cancellation but absolutely a choppier macro environment in europe is that flowing at all into the client discussions and the pipeline as you think about the growth rate outside of the us going forward f philip snow chief executive officer yeah there s obviously a lot going on in europe right in terms of brexit as well as mifid too and other stuff so it s hard to tie any of it honestly to whether or not we re going to see a deceleration there we ve got a great team we ve got a great product and i think we view that market not that much differently than americas honestly right now and if that changes we ll be sure to highlight it for you on the next call or two timothy mchugh william blair company analyst okay thank you f philip snow chief executive officer sure operator your next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research please go ahead keith m housum northcoast research holdings llc analyst great good morning hey helen just a little bit of color on the operating margins for the first half of the year during q4 top end of your guidance obviously you ve got some fx tailwinds at your back do you have those fx tailwinds baked into your guidance for the rest of the year or is that from potential upside helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so thanks for your question we ve looked at that a number of different ways i mean if you take a look at some of our larger currencies of exposed currencies where the dollars are strengthened in the back half of the year so when we compare that to where we think we would be that s already baked in now that being said they can work for us or can work against us so we really don t try to project but if markets were to stay the same as where they land where they are today we d expect to be in the range that we ve given you keith m housum northcoast research holdings llc analyst gotcha was it to ask another question on the margins were there any expenses you didn t occur in the quarter that perhaps you foresee that you had to require in the second half of the year helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer not necessarily nothing that we necessarily haven t already baked into our view keith m housum northcoast research holdings llc analyst gotcha okay if i could ask one question of phil phil you ve mentioned historically that you ought to be able to get to 10 asv growth over long term we re here a little over two years now we ve been stuck in the 6 asv growth area and obviously the markets have been a challenge and quite frankly i m not quite sure if they re going to get any better for any of us but any change to your hope or expectation for long term growth and if so what do you need to get there if consumer markets remain challenged f philip snow chief executive officer yeah so we feel good about how we re performing in this market and our growth rate but we re always focused on acceleration so for us the number one metric that we re focused on as a company is our top line growth and sometimes it takes a while for new products to take hold the environment is not getting any easier but we do feel that some of our product sets i might point to wealth and cts as two that are really a lot of traction recently and have good momentum so i m optimistic as we come out of the second half that we ll have good momentum going into the next fiscal year keith m housum northcoast research holdings llc analyst do you think there s a new long term growth of say 8 instead 10 that perhaps you guys are shooting for f philip snow chief executive officer yeah i m not going to give you a number today i think we re doing a lot of work on our long term strategic plan if we feel like we want to come out with any longer term guidance for you in terms of long term top line growth rate we ll do that operator your next question comes from david chu with bank of america please go ahead david chu bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you so how much incremental asv was added from the b of a contract in the quarter is it something small like 5 of the total or is it something more meaningful f philip snow chief executive officer i don t think we re going to break that out exactly but it was most of the asv was already attributed for in q1 of last year of this year sorry david chu bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great and then just in terms of the erp system implementation where do you guys stand today and when do you expect it to live helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer hi it s helen i m sorry did you want f philip snow chief executive officer go on helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer as it relates to the on the finance side we will continue to work on it we re looking toward fiscal 20 when it would go live as it relates to the hr system we actually have gone live on that and so we re very pleased at the progress we ve made there david chu bank of america merrill lynch analyst and do you expect this to be a cost savings benefit over time or are you already seeing it or do you expect to see that play out over time helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer i don t we don t have it baked in at this point right now i think it s too early to for us to be talking about savings what we re looking at here is productivity and being able to have greater insights in how we manage the business and so we ll see how that works out over time david chu bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer thank you operator your next question comes from ashish sabadra with deutsche bank please go ahead ashish sabadra deutsche bank securities inc analyst thanks phil a question on the comment that you had made around the banking data that you rolled out last quarter i was wondering if you could help us understand how your product now compares to your comparative s l financial from a comparative perspective and then you talked about doubling the number of users as well so as you think about the target market there how do you think about ability to get more users on that front thanks f philip snow chief executive officer yeah so i would say it s very early days we ve just begun to invest here so i m not sure exactly what our competitors have but what i can tell you is we re really encouraged by the data that we do have and the uptick we ve seen in terms of users and the demand from the market for us to do more of this so that i think gives me a lot of confidence that this data investing in not just bank but in some other areas is a good strategy for our company ashish sabadra deutsche bank securities inc analyst that s helpful and then maybe just a quick follow up you also called out that maybe other sectors are there things that are on your priority list that you ve talked about anything that you d share in terms of the sectors that would be equally as important as the financial or banking data f philip snow chief executive officer yeah i think we re just looking across all sectors right now when we have more clarity on that we ll be very happy to share it with you ashish sabadra deutsche bank securities inc analyst i think that s helpful and maybe just a quick follow up like with this new data around new sectors what does that mean for your cps business does it help on that front as well f philip snow chief executive officer it certainly does so we re great at monetizing data both in workstation web as well as off platform so sometimes the more detailed the data the better right in terms of how quantum data scientists want to look at it so as we build that up we ll be able to turn that around very easily and sell it in the feeds over time ashish sabadra deutsche bank securities inc analyst thank you very much thanks f philip snow chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from alex kramm with ubs please go ahead alex kramm ubs group analyst hey hello everyone just a couple follow ups i guess on the margin first i think you mentioned discretionary spending helping this quarter and i look back and i see that the quarter obviously started in december which was a really choppy period so just wondering did you pull back some spending pretty quickly and i guess what i m asking because this is one of those things where it actually shows how you can react which is a positive obviously right to choppier markets if you need to and what flexibility you have and then obviously as you maybe didn t ramp fast enough the ramping s now happening throughout the rest of the year do you know what i m trying to say thank you helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer sure thanks for your question alex so i think as it relates to certain spend you can pull back on certain things are really in flight right so things like professional fees was really much more of an active strategy of how we manage that i think similarly for marketing although that one as to your point you can pull back a bit p e is another one that you can spend more judiciously and so i think we try to pull on some of those levers i don t think i would not say it was because of december in particular i think it s more about us executing on the plan we set forth for the year alex kramm ubs group analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then just lastly you mentioned your restructuring actions and how those have been bearing fruit i mean are we basically done with that now and i guess i m asking to some degree because you continue to have restructuring charges every quarter but this is an ongoing thing at some point it s regular business so i guess i m saying are you do we have this behind us at some point or where do we stand what s the plan that the management has laid out helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer yeah sure so i think for us the program around more material restructuring was in q4 and so we may have had small pieces after that but that i wouldn t look at that as being something that we re continuing every quarter i think what s probably a bigger driver as we think about the productivity gains is also the mix of the employee mix change so we re growing in terms of people much more in our centers of excellence which are outside in the u s as i mentioned more in perhaps in lower cost countries and that s been a driver and i think that s been more material per se and we would expect that to be going forward as well alex kramm ubs group analyst okay thank you helen l shan executive vice president chief financial officer you re welcome operator your last question comes from glenn greene with oppenheimer please go ahead glenn greene oppenheimer co inc analyst thanks for squeezing me in just two quick questions and obviously your margin s been a big profile for this call and tracking expectations at least year to date i think you had an expectation for 100 basis points on margin expansion in fiscal 20 is that still the case and then the secondary question relates to the cancellation in europe to the extent phil you re comfortable commenting on it but was it in any way mifid related or competitive i m just trying to get at confidence that this is a one time isolated issue and we wouldn t expect any other large cancellations in europe going down the road f philip snow chief executive officer all right thanks glenn yeah so we at our last investor day we did say that our plan was to improve margins for the next two years so helen s new we re continuing to think about our long term strategy as something as we go into the end of the year and we think about our multiyear plan whether or not that s something we want to continue to do or if we want to invest more in the business for higher growth and in terms of the emea region yeah it was a one time thing it was competitive but there are lots of situations where we win one time deals versus competitors as well so i think we re entering an age right now where factset is competing for seven figure deals in some cases eight figure deals on a much more frequent basis that we used to with our largest clients and i think some of this lumpiness is what we may continue to see over time glenn greene oppenheimer co inc analyst okay thank you f philip snow chief executive officer thanks well operator there are no f philip snow chief executive officer joining us on the call today we want to thank all of our employees for delivering solid results and express our appreciation to both our clients and shareholders with many of whom we ve had long term relationships if you have additional questions please call rima hyder we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter operator thank you this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect duration 51 minutes

islamabad finance minister asad umar said monday that while pakistan s position remained unchanged the international monetary fund imf had shifted its stance to the outstanding issues raising hope for an early package replying to questions here at the prime minister office the minister said imf had changed its position and a considerable gap had been now narrowed down after they watched the government taking extremely difficult decisions he pointed out that the situation which this government inherited was unprecedented as compared to 2008 2013 and when the pti formed government the foreign exchange reserves were depleted to imports for 15 days and this was never witnessed in the past however he noted that there had been improvement owing to the government measures and the imf acknowledged these measures which saw a significant reduction in current account deficit as compared to the last year prime minister imran khan had specially summoned the finance minister as well as chairman energy task force nadeem babar to respond to questions from media on economy and energy related issues while he spoke generally on other matters asad umar said the imf s view was that the economic challenges that the pti government was confronted with after coming into power were far worse than the situation in 2008 and 2013 when pakistan had signed programmes he emphasised that pakistan was not required to take drastic measures as those already taken in past few months were enough to restore macroeconomic stability however the minister did not rule out some additional measures including currency devaluation the minister said there is was a possibility that pakistan and the imf may sign a deal at the end of imf staff level mission that will arrive in pakistan in the third week of april and the discussions will also take place next month in washington asad umar made it clear that the government could not end all the losses in the energy sector at once and it would gradually be doing away with subsidies he pointed out that overvaluation of the rupee massively damaged the economy the minister noted that the exchange rate was linked with economic fundamentals and as long as there was current account deficit the rupee would keep on shedding its value imran khan said reduction in the public debt as a barometer to gauge the success of his government and added if the pti government managed to reduce the public debt to rs20 trillion from the current rs30 trillion then it will mean we were successful and if the public debt crossed over rs30 trillion then it will mean we have failed the prime minister called on the nation to pray as there was a hope of discovery of large off shore oil and gas reserves nadeem babar said that the government would issue new exploration licenses for 30 blocks to find gas he said that the onshore drilling by two companies was affected due to the security situation he said that there was possibility that this could be largest hydro carbon discovery in asia on the energy situation he pointed out that there were serious issues of demand and gas supply due to article 158 of the constitution as sindh khyber pakhtunkhwa and balochistan had priority right on domestic gas which had created the pricing issue due to expensive lng imports on its part the pml n government in its tenure ignored the power transmission and distribution networks as their focus remained on power generation he said the electricity prices for next two years could go up due to passing on the impact of rs226 billion investment in the power generation and rs170 billion idle capacity payments of the past years he explained this would have resulted in rs4 50 per unit increase but prime minister imran khan refused to do it in one go baber said that the last pml n government did not fully fund electricity subsidies that led to non payment of rs157 billion subsidies by the finance ministry and in future the subsidies would be fully reflected in the budget he said that the pti government was working on reduction of distribution losses hoping to achieve nepra s benchmarks by june 2020 at this point asad umar asked a question from former prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi as to whether there was some national security issue involved which barred them from issuing exploration licenses
gold prices have seen an increasing trend over the past few years almost tripling between 2007 and 2011 gold has grown by nearly 300 in the past 15 years as demand from investors and central banks has risen as a safe haven the idea of investing in gold is based on two hypotheses the continuous erosion of the purchasing power of paper currencies and the low supply of gold as demand rises leading to higher prices investment methods in gold vary including the conventional method such as bullion and pounds and investment funds such as the etf fund mining companies through the acquisition of shares futures contracts and gold deposit certificates and finally the forex market which refers to the foreign exchange fx market ragab hamed the ceo of sabayik al kuwait said that gold is a popular investment currency for all the community which is the best type of investment he added that it fits with all categories of society according to the purchasing power of each category in different forms such as gold jewellery gold bullion pounds of gold or used gold hamed pointed out that gold is one of the safe havens such as real estate and savings certificates but it is the best for easy buying and selling and easy to transfer and keep the customer may have investments in retail estate as prices rise in banks certificates as interests rise or through projects however during problematic times investors will not keep them or guarantee their money as even banks can go bankrupt furthermore he added that gold differs from other havens in that it retains its value especially when other investments fall due to the effects of local or global economic crises the price of gold always rises in economic crises while the purchasing value of currencies collapses during times of crises he stressed that gold has a robustness a nature that allows it to survive and retain its form and value in harsh environments such as burials fires earthquakes and floods moreover he pointed out that gold is one of the most important reserves of central banks so they will not leave its prices to collapse which nominates it to be one of the safest havens ashraf ibrahim an economic researcher said that the tendency of citizens to put their money in bank savings and investments does not save the value of money because of the low interest rates compared to price hikes he added that the interest rate is up to 15 while price rises may reach 20 25 so the value of savings decrease ibrahim explained that gold is the most appropriate investment vessel for several reasons including the general trend of gold to gradually increase in price he noted that customers should retain gold for at least three months to earn profits over and above he pointed out that there are expectations that gold prices will continue to rise in the coming period due to the possible decline of the dollar as the relationship between the dollar and gold is an inverse relationship he added that the possibility of a drop in the dollar is due to the offensive bases pursued by president donald trump which is isolating the united states and pushes most industrialised countries to sign bilateral agreements to exchange currencies instead of the dollar these policies may also generate a new global crisis because they repeat the same decisions that were the main cause of the 2009 crisis he pointed out that at the time of crisis investors avoid dollars and turn their money into gold the scarcity of gold and its limited natural resources enhance its value and make it one of the most important safe investments said youssef ezzat an economist at arab forex he added that the investors turn to gold during times of crises to save the value of money as a hedge tool moreover he explained that gold is a saving and an investment at the same time as it saves the value of funds and earns profits and gains for investors pointing out that the investment in gold is through several methods including hoarding gold in the form of gold or alloys and coins or investing in gold mining companies through purchasing shares the fx market is another way to trade gold which is very similar to currency trading by buying shares on the exchange alaa eddine farhan managing director and consultant for global markets and manager of golden wave fx said that gold is the best safe haven so many central banks have moved to strengthen their gold reserves to boost the strength of their economies such as china india and russia farhan added that it is the best savings pot that preserves the value of money and investing in gold is in two ways either by saving raw gold in the form or jewellery which is low in risk and low in profits or through investing through fx or the so called buy from the screen which is trading in the global market by opening an account with an intermediary furthermore he explained that investing through fx involves risks and requires careful handling and investors should avoid risking investing 10 of their capital

president trump has made a lot of ill advised nominations but perhaps no single choice could inflict more long term damage than the one he announced friday stephen moore trump s pick to join the federal reserve board moore s many economic claims over the years have revealed him to be shall we say easily confused a decade ago as the fed was battling deflation that is price declines during the financial crisis moore preposterously fearmongered that hyperinflation that is out of control price increases was nigh americans could soon be carting wheelbarrows full of cash a la weimar germany moore has also repeatedly predicted that tax cuts would pay for themselves both at the federal level and in kansas despite all evidence to the contrary it s not only his forecasts for the future that have proved chronically incorrect it s his characterizations of past and present too as a presidential candidate donald trump warned about artificially low interest rates now as president trump wants interest rates to stay low video jm rieger elyse samuels the washington post advertisement a newspaper banned him from its pages because of his struggles in getting basic statistics right during the dozens of times i ve debated him on tv he has persistently misstated easily google able facts these include whether the country is experiencing deflation whether canada s tariffs are twice as high as ours and whether the fed predicted that trump would crash the stock market nope nope and huh follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow now somehow moore has been nominated to the fed to understand why this is concerning consider a brief primer of what the fed does congress gave the fed the world s most powerful central bank a dual mandate maximum employment and stable prices for decades beginning with former chairman paul volcker it has also worked to achieve a reputation for political independence which is crucial to its ability to achieve these dual objectives advertisement why as i ve written before politicians pretty much always have an incentive to reduce interest rates and print money especially ahem heading into an election easier money can juice the economy in the short run after all boosting growth and reducing unemployment the trade off is that easy money particularly during a hot economy can lead to inflation and that inflation can be caused not just by recklessly printing money today but by the perception that the central bank might do so in the future when a central bank looks politically compromised as has happened in places such as argentina and venezuela people don t believe it will make the unpopular choices needed to stamp out inflation so firms start jacking up prices and wages in anticipation of more money flooding the economy moore has lately been agitating for looser money and to be clear reasonable people can disagree about whether that s the right policy to pursue right now advertisement the question is why moore supports this policy today while the economy is strong and has been growing above trend he wants both monetary and fiscal stimulus but a decade ago when the financial crisis threatened to throw the united states into a deflationary spiral and another depression he called for rate hikes and austerity because those wheelbarrows full of cash were supposedly around the corner how do you explain this sudden metamorphosis from inflation and deficit hawk to dove in short a democrat was president then a republican is president now moore is a political operative his policy choices appear to be determined by what s best for his party not what is best for the economy you can see that in the way he cherry picks or misstates economic numbers in tv debates or in the fact that he once gleefully nicknamed the trump tax cuts he helped design death to democrats predicting the law would hurt unions colleges obamacare and blue states writ large advertisement and look it is fine for presidents to install political operatives into most executive branch jobs secretaries of commerce transportation labor etc are there to execute the president s agenda but the federal reserve is different to work it needs to be independent both in practice and perception which is why the norm has been that once the senate confirms a president s preferred fed nominees he leaves them alone trump by contrast has thrown hissy fits when his choice for fed chairman jerome h powell refused to do the white house s bidding moore has encouraged these destructive market roiling outbursts publicly urging trump to fire not just powell but everyone at the fed none of this bodes well for the future of central bank independence not just for the remainder of trump s presidency but for either the five or 11 years moore would serve if he is confirmed by the senate depending on which vacancy trump ultimately nominates him for who knows what damage he might be tempted to inflict over that time to make a republican president look good or based on his recommendations during barack obama s presidency a democratic one look bad advertisement the fed has spent decades cultivating its reputation for political autonomy but reputations are hard won and easily lost

gold production in april 2016 this led to a 12 month rolling ltifr of 0 39 per one million hours worked b operational performance the company s gold production in 2018 increased by 4 to 132 656 ounces compared to 126 990 ounces in 2017 the increased gold production was driven by continued improved operating performance in both the mine and processing plant during 2018 351 689 tonnes of ore at 11 7 g t were extracted from the underground mine along with completing 5 826 metres of development compared to 319 855 tonnes of ore at 13 6 g t and 6 819 metres of development in 2017 the mining tonnage increase of 10 was due to more areas available to extract ore and additional equipment increasing productivity during 2018 approximately 92 of ore produced came from stoping activities which is a result of the extensive development that is in place at yaramoko in 2018 decline development at the mine reached the 4913 level approximately 400 metres below surface ore development was completed between the 5049 and 4913 levels the mine continues to be well positioned to meet future production requirements with developed reserves for stoping in line with the company s 18 months planned stoping objectives reconciliation of mined material against the company s resource model and grade control model was within the expected range the grade control model to actual mined shows slightly more ounces produced driven by marginally more tonnes produced the resource model is also performing within the limits of the resource classification an updated resource model will be issued in q2 2019 incorporating an additional 41 000 metres of infill and deep drilling the plant processed a record 307 591 tonnes at an average head grade of 13 5 g t in 2018 compared to 266 599 tonnes of ore at 15 3 g t in 2017 this 15 increase is a result of ongoing optimisation at the plant and translates into a unit throughput rate which is 14 above nameplate capacity plant availability was 95 4 and

sarai nietvelt a general doctor from belgium interacts with a chinese nurse in the foreign funded united family hospital in shanghai on october 19 2018 xinhua on march 15 the second session of the 13th national people s congress china s top legislature adopted the country s first foreign investment law to promote protect and manage foreign investment in the changed circumstances the new law which will take effect on january 1 2020 is expected to enhance the confidence of foreign funded enterprises in china the law eliminates the case by case approval system and makes fundamental changes to the foreign investment management system which is expected to promote all round opening up and bring a legal guarantee for a new open economic system it states that foreign investment shall be managed according to the system of pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list government policies supporting enterprise development will apply equally to them and they will be on par with domestic enterprises regarding participation in standardization work and government procurement activity the law cracks down on extra legal curbs on foreign investment governments and relevant departments at all levels are required to formulate foreign investment related regulatory documents in accordance with laws and regulations there are also provisions that they may not undermine foreign invested enterprises lawful rights or impose obligations in violation of law and shall not set market entry and exit conditions or interfere or influence foreign invested enterprises normal business activities in violation of law in addition the law stresses improving investment related services and simplifying management procedures demonstrating the government s commitment to creating a fair and equitable market mechanism and providing an open and transparent investment environment a phased approach china s current legal system to manage foreign investmentâ consisting of the law on chinese foreign equity joint ventures the law on non equity joint ventures and the law on wholly foreign owned enterprisesâ was put in place in the initial phase of reform and opening up that started in 1978 foreign investment projects are subject to administrative approval and normally enjoy preferential treatment after it joined the world trade organiza tion in 2001 china focused on developing its legal system in line with international standards and the laws and regulations on foreign investment were amended substantially still the three laws which will be replaced by the foreign investment law are not in line with the company law and the contract law that were amended in 2018 since the global financial crisis in 2008 the united states and other developed countries have accelerated negotiations on free trade agreements and come up with new rules of global trade and investment china needs to restructure the domestic economic system and creates new driving forces through a higher level of opening up as its economy has shifted from high speed to high quality growth a new round of opening up started in 2013 focusing on establishing pilot free trade zones ftzs the china shanghai pilot ftz was established the same year and china began to explore a pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system for managing foreign investment after a negative list was implemented in the shanghai ftz which specifies the sectors off limits to foreign investors relevant laws on foreign investment management were suspended within the zone for a three year trial period on january 19 2015 the ministry of commerce mofcom published the draft foreign investment law to solicit public feedback and in the following year the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system was expanded across china based on the experience of pilot ftzs and trial reforms in the same year mofcom issued interim policies specifying that foreign funded enterprises no longer need approval to invest in areas not designated in the negative list in june 2018 a shortened negative list for foreign investment came into effect containing just 48 items down from the 63 in the previous version the new negative list the special administrative measures on access to foreign investment was jointly released by mofcom and the national development and reform commission in november 2018 president xi jinping gave his assurance at the first china international import expo in shanghai that china will speed up new foreign investment legislation fully implement the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system and develop a world class business environment as china is shifting from opening up based on the flow of commodities and production factors to liberalization of rules and systems the case by case approval system in the original foreign investment laws fails to meet the needs of the new open economic system and wider opening up there is a need for a more favorable legal environment for institutional openness the new law meets that need creating a more transparent stable and predictable policy environment for foreign investors doing business in china global direct investment has shrunk with the rise of trade and investment protectionism china s original advantages for attracting investment have been weakened by the rising cost of domestic labor and other factors besides there are higher demands on china s investment environment such as opening up more sectors treating foreign investors on par with domestic enterprises strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights and banning forced technology transfer faced with these considerations china has striven to follow international standards by opening up wider enhancing government services and streamlining approval procedures and improving its business environment according to the world bank s doing business 2018 report china s ranking in the ease of doing business index improved from 78th to 46th last year against the sharp decline in global direct investment china maintained steady growth with the paid in amount reaching a record high at 134 97 billion in 2018 singapore accounted for 53 4 percent of the chinese mainland s total foreign investment a year on year increase of 10 6 percent the investment went to industrial parks

china besides capital singapore also exports advanced management expertise to china investment from european union countries maintained rapid growth in 2018 their investment amounted to 11 86 billion up 35 percent year on year with china opening up its financial healthcare and education sectors british investment registered strong growth with a total value of 3 89 billion increasing 159 3 percent year on year britain has become the fifth largest source of foreign investment for china improving from ninth place in 2017 the adoption of the foreign investment law reflects china s resolve to widen opening up and provide a more fair open and institutionalized business environment based on the rule of law that favors long term development of foreign funded enterprises notably it will promote utilization of high quality overseas capital technologies and professionals on a larger scale and give fuller play to resources from the domestic and international markets to ensure steady growth of

revenues and expenses to vary albds assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue producing ship operating days in the period b for the three months ended february 28 2019 compared to the three months ended february 28 2018 we had a 4 1 capacity increase in albds comprised of a 5 0 capacity increase in our north america and australia naa segment and a 2 5 capacity increase in our europe and asia ea segment our naa segment s capacity increase was caused by full quarter impact from one carnival cruise line 3

removed from service in march 2018 full quarter impact from one costa cruises 1 300 passenger capacity ship removed from service in april 2018 c in accordance with cruise industry practice occupancy is calculated using a denominator of albds which assumes two passengers per cabin even though some cabins can accommodate three or more passengers percentages in excess of 100 indicate that on average

revenue yields gross cruise costs per albd and u s gaap net income and u s gaap earnings per share net revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or albd changes from price and other changes that affect our business we believe these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our u s gaap consolidated financial statements under u s gaap the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings we believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings therefore we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses we believe that gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance therefore we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges and restructuring and other non core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items the presentation of our non gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from as substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with u s gaap it is possible that our non gaap financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like kind information presented by other companies which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company s cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes we use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields we believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs which are travel agent commissions cost of air and other transportation certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues net of commissions transportation and other costs net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues net of onboard and other cruise costs net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd is the measure we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments costs rather than gross cruise costs per albd we exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non gaap financial measures substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed except for the impact of changing prices once the number of albds has been determined reconciliation of forecasted data we have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted u s gaap net income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted u s gaap earnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful u s gaap forecasts of gross cruise revenues gross cruise costs net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices we are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales restructuring expenses and other non core gains and charges constant dollar and constant currency our operations primarily utilize the u s dollar australian dollar euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition functional currencies other than the u s dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk we report net revenue yields net passenger revenue yields net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd on a constant dollar and constant currency basis assuming the 2019 periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2018 periods rates these metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates constant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations constant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations as in constant dollar plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency examples the translation of our operations with functional currencies other than u s dollar to our u s dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar weakens against these foreign currencies our operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency if their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses if the functional currency weakens against these other currencies it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses

in line on a comparable basis to the prior year while booking volumes are ahead compared to the prior year as a result even with higher capacity there is less inventory remaining for sale than at the same time last year donald added booking trends achieved during wave season rivaled last years historical highs and were consistent with the demand trends we experienced going into the year building further confidence in our full year guidance for our north america and australia brands our booked position is ahead of the prior year at higher prices while our europe and asia brands are well ahead of the prior year at lower prices our brands are strong and growing including continental europe where we continue to expect revenue growth driven by double digit capacity increases based on current booking trends the company continues to expect full year 2019 constant currency net cruise revenues to be up approximately 5 5 percent with capacity growth of 4 6 percent and net revenue yields in constant currency expected to be up approximately 1 0 percent compared to the prior year driven by our naa brands the company continues to expect full year net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd in

revenue yields gross cruise costs per albd and u s gaap net income and u s gaap earnings per share net revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or albd changes from price and other changes that affect our business we believe these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our u s gaap consolidated financial statements under u s gaap the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings we believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings therefore we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses we believe that gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance therefore we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges and restructuring and other non core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items the presentation of our non gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from as substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with u s gaap it is possible that our non gaap financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like kind information presented by other companies which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company s cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes we use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields we believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs which are travel agent commissions cost of air and other transportation certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues net of commissions transportation and other costs net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues net of onboard and other cruise costs net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd is the measure we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments costs rather than gross cruise costs per albd we exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non gaap financial measures substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed except for the impact of changing prices once the number of albds has been determined reconciliation of forecasted data we have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted u s gaap net income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted u s gaap earnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful u s gaap forecasts of gross cruise revenues gross cruise costs net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices we are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales restructuring expenses and other non core gains and charges constant dollar and constant currency our operations primarily utilize the u s dollar australian dollar euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition functional currencies other than the u s dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk we report net revenue yields net passenger revenue yields net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd on a constant dollar and constant currency basis assuming the 2019 periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2018 periods rates these metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates constant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations constant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations as in constant dollar plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency examples the translation of our operations with functional currencies other than u s dollar to our u s dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar weakens against these foreign currencies our operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency if their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses if the functional currency weakens against these other currencies it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses

sarai nietvelt a general doctor from belgium interacts with a chinese nurse in the foreign funded united family hospital in shanghai on october 19 2018 xinhua on march 15 the second session of the 13th national people s congress china s top legislature adopted the country s first foreign investment law to promote protect and manage foreign investment in the changed circumstances the new law which will take effect on january 1 2020 is expected to enhance the confidence of foreign funded enterprises in china the law eliminates the case by case approval system and makes fundamental changes to the foreign investment management system which is expected to promote all round opening up and bring a legal guarantee for a new open economic system it states that foreign investment shall be managed according to the system of pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list government policies supporting enterprise development will apply equally to them and they will be on par with domestic enterprises regarding participation in standardization work and government procurement activity the law cracks down on extra legal curbs on foreign investment governments and relevant departments at all levels are required to formulate foreign investment related regulatory documents in accordance with laws and regulations there are also provisions that they may not undermine foreign invested enterprises lawful rights or impose obligations in violation of law and shall not set market entry and exit conditions or interfere or influence foreign invested enterprises normal business activities in violation of law in addition the law stresses improving investment related services and simplifying management procedures demonstrating the government s commitment to creating a fair and equitable market mechanism and providing an open and transparent investment environment a phased approach china s current legal system to manage foreign investmentâ consisting of the law on chinese foreign equity joint ventures the law on non equity joint ventures and the law on wholly foreign owned enterprisesâ was put in place in the initial phase of reform and opening up that started in 1978 foreign investment projects are subject to administrative approval and normally enjoy preferential treatment after it joined the world trade organiza tion in 2001 china focused on developing its legal system in line with international standards and the laws and regulations on foreign investment were amended substantially still the three laws which will be replaced by the foreign investment law are not in line with the company law and the contract law that were amended in 2018 since the global financial crisis in 2008 the united states and other developed countries have accelerated negotiations on free trade agreements and come up with new rules of global trade and investment china needs to restructure the domestic economic system and creates new driving forces through a higher level of opening up as its economy has shifted from high speed to high quality growth a new round of opening up started in 2013 focusing on establishing pilot free trade zones ftzs the china shanghai pilot ftz was established the same year and china began to explore a pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system for managing foreign investment after a negative list was implemented in the shanghai ftz which specifies the sectors off limits to foreign investors relevant laws on foreign investment management were suspended within the zone for a three year trial period on january 19 2015 the ministry of commerce mofcom published the draft foreign investment law to solicit public feedback and in the following year the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system was expanded across china based on the experience of pilot ftzs and trial reforms in the same year mofcom issued interim policies specifying that foreign funded enterprises no longer need approval to invest in areas not designated in the negative list in june 2018 a shortened negative list for foreign investment came into effect containing just 48 items down from the 63 in the previous version the new negative list the special administrative measures on access to foreign investment was jointly released by mofcom and the national development and reform commission in november 2018 president xi jinping gave his assurance at the first china international import expo in shanghai that china will speed up new foreign investment legislation fully implement the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system and develop a world class business environment as china is shifting from opening up based on the flow of commodities and production factors to liberalization of rules and systems the case by case approval system in the original foreign investment laws fails to meet the needs of the new open economic system and wider opening up there is a need for a more favorable legal environment for institutional openness the new law meets that need creating a more transparent stable and predictable policy environment for foreign investors doing business in china global direct investment has shrunk with the rise of trade and investment protectionism china s original advantages for attracting investment have been weakened by the rising cost of domestic labor and other factors besides there are higher demands on china s investment environment such as opening up more sectors treating foreign investors on par with domestic enterprises strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights and banning forced technology transfer faced with these considerations china has striven to follow international standards by opening up wider enhancing government services and streamlining approval procedures and improving its business environment according to the world bank s doing business 2018 report china s ranking in the ease of doing business index improved from 78th to 46th last year against the sharp decline in global direct investment china maintained steady growth with the paid in amount reaching a record high at 134 97 billion in 2018 singapore accounted for 53 4 percent of the chinese mainland s total foreign investment a year on year increase of 10 6 percent the investment went to industrial parks including demonstration projects such as the suzhou industrial park in east china s jiangsu province that began as a bilateral project with singapore and the sino singapore tianjin eco city in north china besides capital singapore also exports advanced management expertise to china investment from european union countries maintained rapid growth in 2018 their investment amounted to 11 86 billion up 35 percent year on year with china opening up its financial healthcare and education sectors british investment registered strong growth with a total value of 3 89 billion increasing 159 3 percent year on year britain has become the fifth largest source of foreign investment for china improving from ninth place in 2017 the adoption of the foreign investment law reflects china s resolve to widen opening up and provide a more fair open and institutionalized business environment based on the rule of law that favors long term development of foreign funded enterprises notably it will promote

13th national people s congress china s top legislature adopted the country s first foreign investment law to promote protect and manage foreign investment in the changed circumstances the new law

managed according to the system of pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list government policies supporting enterprise development will apply equally to them and they will be on par with domestic enterprises regarding participation in standardization work and government procurement activity the law cracks down on extra legal curbs on foreign investment governments and relevant departments at all levels are required to formulate foreign investment related regulatory documents in accordance with laws and regulations there are also provisions that they may not undermine foreign invested enterprises lawful rights or impose obligations in violation of law and shall not set market entry and exit conditions or interfere or influence foreign invested enterprises normal business activities in violation of law in addition the law stresses improving investment related services and simplifying management procedures demonstrating the government s commitment to creating a fair and equitable market mechanism and providing an open and transparent investment environment a phased approach china s current legal system to manage foreign investmentâ consisting of the law on chinese foreign equity joint ventures the law on non equity joint ventures and the law on wholly foreign owned enterprisesâ was put in place in the initial phase of reform and opening up that started in 1978 foreign investment projects are subject to administrative approval and normally enjoy preferential treatment after it joined the world trade organiza tion in 2001 china focused on developing its legal system in line with international standards and the laws and regulations on foreign investment were amended substantially still the three laws which will be replaced by the foreign investment law are not in line with the company law and the contract law that were amended in 2018 since the global financial crisis in 2008 the united states and other developed countries have accelerated negotiations on free trade agreements and come up with new rules of global trade and investment china needs to restructure the domestic economic system and creates new driving forces through a higher level of opening up as its economy has shifted from high speed to high quality growth a new round of opening up started in 2013 focusing on establishing pilot free trade zones ftzs the china shanghai pilot ftz was established the same year and china began to explore a pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system for managing foreign investment after a negative list was implemented in the shanghai ftz which specifies the sectors off limits to foreign investors relevant laws on foreign investment management were suspended within the zone for a three year trial period on january 19 2015 the ministry of commerce mofcom published the draft foreign investment law to solicit public feedback and in the following year the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system was expanded across china based on the experience of pilot ftzs and trial reforms in the same year mofcom issued interim policies specifying that foreign funded enterprises no longer need approval to invest in areas not designated in the negative list in june 2018 a shortened negative list for foreign investment came into effect containing just 48 items down from the 63 in the previous version the new negative list the special administrative measures on access to foreign investment was jointly released by mofcom and the national development and reform commission in november 2018 president xi jinping gave his assurance at the first china international import expo in shanghai that china will speed up new foreign investment legislation fully implement the pre establishment national treatment plus a negative list system and develop a world class business environment as china is shifting from opening up based on the flow of commodities and production factors to liberalization of rules and systems the case by case approval system in the original foreign investment laws fails to meet the needs of the new open economic system and wider opening up there is a need for a more favorable legal environment for institutional openness the new law meets that need creating a more transparent stable and predictable policy environment for foreign investors doing business in china global direct investment has shrunk with the rise of trade and investment protectionism china s original advantages for attracting investment have been weakened by the rising cost of domestic labor and other factors besides there are higher demands on china s investment environment such as opening up more sectors treating foreign investors on par with domestic enterprises strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights and banning forced technology transfer faced with these considerations china has striven to follow international standards by opening up wider enhancing government services and streamlining approval procedures and improving its business environment according to the world bank s doing business 2018 report china s ranking in

year on year britain has become the fifth largest source of foreign investment for china improving from ninth place in 2017 the adoption of the foreign investment law reflects china s resolve to widen opening up and provide a more fair open and institutionalized business environment based on the rule of law that favors long term development of foreign funded enterprises notably it will promote

hong kong something strange happened recently in the hong kong property market on new year s eve a buyer put down a 5 per cent deposit for the purchase of a three storey us 92 5 million house perched high up on the hills of hong kong island with a garden and a pool the house offers sweeping views of the city below and the harbour beyond a month later the buyer backed out losing his us 4 6 million deposit it is unclear what caused the whopping default the unidentified buyer may have had financing problems or had decided that it was a bad bet but a default of this scale is very very rare said nicole wong regional head of property research at clsa an investment and brokerage group it could also speak to a wider sense of unease about the city s property market while forfeitures of deposits are still relatively uncommon a spate in recent months by potential homebuyers appears to signal waning confidence in the market after years of steep price increases affirming hong kong s position as the city with the world s most unaffordable property a distinction it has held for nine straight years the housing market entered a months long period of decline starting last summer in general from last mid year to now the atmosphere in the housing property market has not been good said koh keng shing founder and chief executive of landscope christie s a real estate agency in hong kong prices in the residential mass market have slumped mortgage applications have plummeted and the number of transactions has plunged reaching the lowest since 2005 in september from july to december 2018 home prices fell almost 10 per cent according to data from the city s rating and valuation department in the steepest month on month decline since the global financial crisis of 2008 the property price index fell 3 5 per cent in november after a 28 month streak of price increases the longest in the city s history it seemed things were finally starting to cool off behind this trend experts say are a number of factors while hong kong s economy continues to hum along property prices were hurt by a series of events during the past few months growing trade tensions between china and the united states the interest rate increase in the us a cooling economy in china that has caused a drop in the value of the nation s currency and the volatility of the hang seng index but some analysts already see signs of a turnaround ms wong of clsa said she was bullish about the market she pointed out that the us federal reserve announced in january that it would halt interest rate increases china s central bank had taken action to stabilise the yuan and hong kong s stocks were coming back she said she expected home prices to start rising again the number of property viewings in late january and early february rose during what is typically a quiet period before the chinese new year holiday the number of transactions made above bank valuations has also returned to the two year average after a months long slump she said the latest prices have actually stabilised and are coming up from the bottom said ms wong adding that she expected property prices to increase 15 per cent a substantial uptick in demand may also come from a large pool of chinese mainlanders who have lived in the city for seven years and will qualify for hong kong permanent residency this year which will exempt them from the extra taxes levied on nonresident property buyers ms wong said whether hong kong s property market slumps further as some industry watchers fear or regains steam and continues its march upwards one underlying fact will in all likelihood remain unchanged homes in this city are wildly unaffordable for the overwhelming majority of residents nowhere are hong kong s sky high property prices on fuller display than at the peak the high end residential neighbourhood of the superwealthy where the potential buyer abandoned the us 4 6 million deposit back in hong kong s colonial days laws were put in place to make sure that only europeans were allowed to own property on the peak those laws are long gone and today anyone who can afford to do so can live there it s just that very few people can for the average person your income per annum may buy the bathroom said beverly sunn founder and president of asia pacific properties a hong kong real estate firm one house last year sold for us 114 9 million or us 20 400 per square foot psf while another sold for us 178 5 million or us 19 400 psf it s the hamptons of hong kong said ms sunn who has kept a close watch on the neighbourhood s real estate market and has seen it change over the years whereas much of the property around the peak in the past few decades was held by large uk firms multinationals and wealthy non chinese locals the past 10 years have seen an influx of money from chinese investors you ve seen just a tremendous amount of chinese companies and individuals and heads of these firms purchasing into this premier real estate area ms sunn said as property prices on the peak have risen along with the rest of the city s real estate market homeowners have increasingly turned to redeveloping their lots into complexes mostly low rise apartment buildings but also smaller townhouses that can generate huge profits that has often meant knocking down houses that date to the 19th century i don t think there are many houses on the peak that remain in the same form as when they were first built said ho puay peng a professor of architecture at the national university of singapore they ve been demolished and redeveloped very few original houses remain on the peak house 16 the us 92 million property that was suddenly left without a buyer this year is part of a new super luxurious development named mount nicholson built on a plot of land the government sold to a property developer in 2010 for us 1 3 billion the development tucked away at the top of a quiet road features 19 detached houses and 48 apartments and the first properties hit the market in 2015 house 16 s price tag is nothing compared with the sale of a standalone pink house with a lawn and a pool on 5 pollock path a cul de sac that a few years ago was named the most expensive street in the world it is one of the few remaining original houses on the peak half a century ago this house was not luxurious in any sense of the word when charles and rosamond brown bought it in the 1960s it was a wreck the garden overgrown and the windows ajar exposing the interior to damage from the elements the browns had so little money back then that they painted it themselves more than five decades later rosamond brown now a widow sold the house in 2017 for 3 2 billion hong kong dollars s 551 million including tax it was arranged after the sale that brown would rent it back until summer 2018 according to the south china morning post now with the house sold to a new owner named yeung kin man a hong kong born businessman no one knows what the future holds for the property it may be lost to the wrecking ball like most of the old peak houses since a trend of demolitions started in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the city s property market started to boom or it may be preserved a nod to the house s history and the changes it has witnessed around it while some bemoan the loss of history on the peak others think that trying to conserve the few remaining old houses there is ultimately futile the demolition of a peak property called ho tung gardens in 2013 is emblematic of the difficulties and realities of historical conservation in fast paced hong kong the estate was built in 1927 by sir robert hotung a hong kong businessman and the first chinese person to be granted permission to own property on the peak the city s government had wanted to preserve the entire complex but talks with the owner broke down the owner ordered the main building to be bulldozed and in 2015 the estate was sold to a developer for a record hk 5 1 billion the government s preservation efforts had been no match for a private developer with much deeper pockets and another piece of history was lost for lee ho yin a professor and the director of architectural conservation programmes at the university of hong kong the solution is straightforward if history is lost on the peak then so be it with hong kong s conservation we cannot look into the past anymore he said there s not enough past left not enough history hong kong s conservation has to look into the future and think about what happens in 20 30 50 years time that future he said revolves around heritage conservation in old neighbourhoods in the city s core where there is a larger stock of postwar buildings that can be preserved and refurbished for commercial uses what is hong kong what is the nature of hong kong mr lee said it s an economic city that is our thing it s how we ve become what we are today we have to play to our strengths and not try to be something else nytimes
an ongoing trade dispute with the united states and a slowing economy are casting a big question mark over china just as it is making a tectonic shift to a developed consumer society from a developing industrial society the latest economic indicators make it abundantly clear the days of double digit growth for the world s second largest economy are gone but it s far from grinding to a halt according to robert scott senior economist at the washington d c based economic policy institute i think china will continue to grow it s too big and has too many resources to stop growing but i think the rate of growth will slow into the single digits he says open this photo in gallery a sales representative waits for customers in a luxury car showroom in beijing greg baker afp getty images financial advisors and investors who want to understand the challenges facing china must dig beneath the quarterly numbers and understand the political and societal changes that will shape the country for decades to come mr scott says although much has been made of the power of china s emerging middle class to drive growth power and wealth remain concentrated at the top china has failed to develop an adequate domestic market there s huge income inequality within chinese society there s a few people at the top but the average working family still has low levels of income he says adding that china s centralized communist government has failed to transfer power to the masses by permitting independent trade unions that can bargain for wages i think it s a conscious strategy of the government to continue to grow the economy through oddly enough worker exploitation this is what s going on in this allegedly communist society mr scott says they re keeping wages extraordinarily low even as they grow and develop and the economy has increased its output enormously a very small share of those benefits has trickled down to the middle or working class regardless of how trade talks between china and the u s go china will continue to be pressed by the rest of the world to loosen its grip on the yuan and yield its low cost export advantage mr scott says china is hyper competitive it got that way by engaging in two decades of currency manipulation another trade related bone of contention is china s practice of ignoring intellectual property rights the new china must develop its own technologies through research and development mr scott says that s a much more difficult job trying to produce new technologies rather than borrowing or stealing them from other companies or countries for investors the old china was a boon between january 2006 and june 2015 the benchmark shanghai composite index rose in value by about 340 per cent as china s transition to a consumer economy accelerated the index has declined by about 40 per cent from that 2015 high as a company you just had to grow with the market and you were golden clearly that is changing says matthew strauss vice president and portfolio manager at ci investments inc despite the slowing economy he remains invested in china from an investment perspective is still one of the fastest growing big economies it is still an economy of incredible opportunity he says however mr strauss strategy has changed to focus more on the financial results of individual companies and how they are geared toward long term growth companies now really have to focus on execution cost controls how to manage margins protecting or gaining market share he says mr strauss sees the best opportunities in companies linked to the growing bank accounts of china s middle class education health care insurance wealth management and the internet these are some of the industries that despite the changes we have seen will continue to grow at a very fast pace he says two china based internet companies in the ci portfolio are online retail giant alibaba group holding ltd and tencent holdings ltd which provides a social media site and money transfer service similar to paypal alibaba and tencent would be two of those big companies that continue to see growth and dominate their space in china he says in the health care space mr strauss holds pharmaceutical maker jiangsu hengrui medicine co we think jiangsu is a good way to play the whole health care side and the growing demand for health care and health care products his top pick among financials is the full service insurance provider ping an insurance group co even if growth slows down ping an might slow down at the margin but not nearly as significantly as the overall chinese market he says as more chinese retail investors enter the market he warns retail investors on this side of the ocean to beware of market volatility and to avoid buying at the top there are going to be times when even if you believe strongly in the company it s overpriced because sentiment is too much in favour of the stock he says then maybe it s time to step away and reload at better levels
overview typical transaction structures public companies what is the typical structure of a business combination involving a publicly traded real estate owning entity generally business combinations of real estate related businesses occur through the merger or acquisition of a publicly traded real estate company these public real estate merger and acquisition m a deals are structured to take into account tax regulatory and operational considerations typically such transactions are structured as triangular mergers in which a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquirer is merged with the target triangular mergers take one of two forms forward or reverse in a forward triangular merger the acquirer s merger subsidiary not the target survives the merger in the reverse triangular merger the target survives resulting in the target becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the acquirer reverse triangular mergers frequently provide the benefit of avoiding third party consent rights resulting from changes of control or assignment public m a deals other than where underlying assets are few in number are rarely if ever structured as asset sales due to the time and expense required to evaluate direct transfer restrictions and to prepare title transfer documents for each property individually the structuring of public transactions involving one or more real estate investment trusts reits depends on the corporate structure of each reit reits are often structured as umbrella partnership reits upreits that hold and operate properties through a wholly owned or partially owned operating partnership in which the reit is the general partner in this scenario in addition to a merger of the publicly traded entity operating as a reit which is typically a corporation the operating partnership of the target may be merged with the acquirer or survive the merger as subsidiary the structuring analysis is influenced by limitations in the governing documents of the entities tax treatment of the transaction and the most efficient tax treatment of the post closing company typical transaction structures private companies are there are any significant differences if the transaction involves a privately held real estate owning entity as described above combinations of publicly traded real estate owning entities are more prevalent than combinations of privately held real estate owning entities transactions involving private real estate businesses are more often structured as asset purchases either of single assets or portfolios which allow the acquirer to avoid inheriting certain entity level liabilities of the previous property owning entity while private entities are sometimes purchased to accommodate specific objectives for example transfer tax savings such transactions are rarely combinations of entire enterprises transactions involving a privately held real estate owning entity are in general similar to transactions involving publicly held real estate owning entities except that such transactions typically include an obligation by the seller to indemnify the buyer for liability up to a cap resulting from breaches of seller s representations and warranties r ws typical transaction process describe the process by which public and private real estate business combinations are typically initiated negotiated and completed transactions follow many different paths including as a result of conversations between a potential acquirer and a target due to perceived synergies including cost savings geographic or asset type diversification an auction sale process initiated by the target to create value for its shareholders or an activist investor commencing a campaign to change management or sell the company recently activists have taken an increasing role in triggering public m a transactions by targeting reits perceived to be undervalued or ripe for a strategic combination activists have also targeted reit intensive operating companies eg sears macy s and target in an effort to foment sales or spin offs of real estate assets that are undervalued law and regulation legislative and regulatory framework what are some of the primary laws and regulations governing or implicated in real estate business combinations are there any specific regulations or laws governing transfers of real estate that would be material in a typical transaction foremost among the multiple laws governing public real estate combinations are the corporate laws of the target s state of organisation and federal securities laws applicable to m a transactions involving publicly traded companies generally in addition each us state and local jurisdiction has a separate regime of real property law that could potentially impact an m a deal for instance local law governs the imposition of transfer taxes and mortgage recording taxes in addition there are some jurisdictions that require reassessments of real property in the event of certain changes in control as a result local counsel should be consulted in states where material components of a target s portfolio are located to advise on matters of local law cross border combinations and foreign investment are there any specific material regulations or structuring considerations relating to cross border real estate business combinations or foreign investors acquiring an interest in a real estate business entity the foreign investment in real property tax act of 1980 firpta can subject foreign owners of us real estate or of shares in domestic us real property holding corporations to taxes on gains in value upon the sale of such real estate including assets held in a reit however firpta does not apply to shares of reits that are domestically controlled ie with a majority of shares held directly and indirectly by domestic owners or to portfolio interests 10 per cent or less in publicly traded us real property holding corporations certain types of shareholders eg qualified foreign pensions or sovereigns also may be exempt from taxation under firpta foreign investors should be aware that the committee on foreign investment in the us cfius might review the acquisition of real estate that is proximate to or is itself critical infrastructure or otherwise poses a sensitive security risk examples have included assets that adjoin sensitive us military installations or us government tenants submitting to cfius review is initially voluntary on the part of parties to a transaction but cfius or an individual agency member of cfius can initiate a review on its own and cfius has subpoena power to compel the production of information over the past few years foreign investment in real estate has received increased attention from us authorities that focus on national security which has included cfius reviews of high profile real estate transactions such as the 2014 acquisition of the waldorf astoria by the anbang insurance group co although the recently enacted foreign investment risk review modernization act of 2018 expands the scope of transactions subject to cfius review to include acquisition of real estate assets that do not in the aggregate constitute an operable business it does not materially change policy with respect to combinations of publicly traded real estate businesses which were already subject to cfius review prior to this law s enactment choice of law and jurisdiction what territory s law typically governs the definitive agreements in the context of real estate business combinations which courts typically have subject matter jurisdiction over a real estate related business combination each us state has a separate corporate law regime that governs entities organised in the state because many entities in the us are organised in the state of delaware and because there is generally a high degree of comfort with the application of delaware law delaware law is often selected to govern corporate and m a purchase agreements reits are frequently organised under maryland law and are typically corporations when maryland law governs the reit maryland law is typically chosen to govern definitive agreements parties can also agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in a particular state and often a particular city courts in the state of new york and specifically manhattan are often chosen the delaware chancery court is often chosen for public company deals involving delaware companies and maryland courts may be chosen for deals involving public maryland reits note that in certain circumstances the state whose courts are selected may be different from the state whose law applies to the documents relevant factors in determining the combination of law or jurisdiction relate to the selection of a neutral venue convenience of the parties and sophistication of the judiciary us securities laws and the rules of the us securities and exchange commission sec also apply to acquisitions of a publicly traded company approval and withdrawal public disclosure what information must be publicly disclosed in a public company real estate business combination under the applicable proxy rules in a one step merger or tender offer rules in a tender offer all agreements with the target and any of its shareholders or executive officers must be publicly filed and summarised for shareholders the bidder s sources of funds are also disclosed any financing agreements are summarised and for a tender offer are publicly filed a fairly detailed description of negotiations and other transaction background including other bidders proposals is also required any other information that would be material to a target shareholder must also be disclosed if the acquisition consideration offered to shareholders includes securities the buyer must register the offered securities under the securities act of 1933 requiring among other things two or three years of sec compliant financial statements with a management discussion and analysis md a and usually pro forma financial statements and a full business description if the buyer is already an sec reporting company much of this can be done through incorporation by reference to already publicly filed materials if not this is a major undertaking akin to a us initial public offering duties towards shareholders give an overview of the material duties if any of the directors and officers of a public company towards shareholders in connection with a real estate business combination do controlling shareholders have any similar duties directors duties depend on the entity type and state of organisation most publicly traded real estate related companies are either delaware corporations or maryland reits in an acquisition of a delaware corporation entirely or significantly for cash directors have a duty to use reasonable efforts to obtain the highest value reasonably obtainable revlon duties this does not always require an auction or even a confidential solicitation of bids but until the shareholders vote to approve or a tender offer is consummated the board must retain the ability to respond to bona fide indications of interest provide information to and negotiate with another bidder change its recommendation of the initial deal to shareholders and usually retain the right to terminate an acquisition agreement to accept a superior proposal subject to paying an agreed termination fee a controlling shareholder does not have a duty to agree to sell even if that prevents other shareholders from receiving an attractive offer if the acquirer already controls a delaware corporation see question 16 while revlon does not apply to publicly traded maryland reits directors have duties to act in good faith and what they reasonably believe is in the reit s best interest and act with due care generally acquisition agreements for these types of reit s are very similar to agreements for acquisitions of delaware corporations as to these types of provisions shareholders rights what rights do shareholders have in a public company real estate business combination can parties structure around shareholder dissent or rejection of a real estate business combination and what structures are available if the acquisition is structured as a tender offer shareholders have the right after receiving full and accurate disclosure to decide whether to tender in most situations if a majority of the outstanding shares are tendered and acquired the acquirer may and will likely by contract be required to immediately be able to squeeze out the remaining shareholders in exchange for the same consideration or if appraisal rights are available in exchange for the appraised value payable in cash as noted below if the acquisition is instead structured as a one step merger the merger must be approved by holders of a majority of outstanding shares or a higher threshold specified in the certificate of incorporation in the case of a delaware corporation or by holders of two thirds of outstanding shares or a higher or lower threshold specified in the declaration of trust but not less than a majority in the case of a maryland reit in delaware if shareholders of a listed company are required to accept anything other than listed shares or american depository receipts of the acquirer shareholders who do not tender their shares or do not vote in favour of the merger can exercise appraisal rights and receive the court determined fair value of their shares in cash excluding value arising from the completion or expectation of the merger for a publicly traded maryland reit there are generally no appraisal rights available unless the reit is organised as a corporation shareholders are required to receive cash as consideration and the reit s directors and executive officers beneficially own in aggregate more than 5 per cent of the reit s outstanding shares and any of them have the right to roll over their shares for shares of the acquirer which right is not made available to all shareholders termination fees are termination fees typical in a real estate business combination and what is their typical size a delaware corporation can agree to pay a reasonable termination fee if its board terminates the transaction to accept or changes its recommendation in light of what it concludes is a superior proposal such a fee is also commonly payable if the shareholders reject the tender offer or merger following a third party s competing proposal and if the target is acquired within a specified period following the termination while there is no precise definition of a reasonable termination fee fees of 2 5 per cent to 3 5 per cent or for small deals 4 per cent of the equity value of the deal are common and regularly upheld often inclusive of expense reimbursement but sometimes in addition to reimbursement up to a cap similar fees are generally included in acquisition agreements for maryland reits if the acquirer is relying on external financing there may be a reverse termination fee generally as large as the termination fee or substantially larger payable if the deal does not close because financing falls through even though the bidder complied with its obligations see question 34 takeover defences are there any methods that targets in a real estate business combination can employ to protect against an unsolicited acquisition are there any limitations on these methods defensive methods similar to those used in the general public m a context are also used against hostile bids for publicly traded real estate businesses for example a real estate owning company may amend its organisational documents to require an increased threshold for the required percentage of shareholders necessary to approve business combinations a business may also have a board of directors comprised of multiple classes of directors with staggered terms such that a hostile bidder is unable to replace the majority of directors within a single year with directors more favourable to the hostile bidder additionally publicly listed maryland reits typically have provisions in their organisational documents prohibiting any investor from acquiring more than 9 8 per cent as a result of the need to maintain the reit s preferential tax status without prior board approval in both delaware and maryland a corporation can adopt a poison pill shareholder rights plan pursuant to which if any entity or group acquires more than a specified percentage of shares its ownership will be subject to possibly massive dilution notifying shareholders how much advance notice must a public target give its shareholders in connection with approving a real estate business combination and what factors inform this analysis how is shareholder approval typically sought in this context in a one step merger the target must generally mail the proxy statement at least 20 business days before the shareholder meeting at which the vote takes place in a merger the target must file the proxy statement in preliminary form with the sec which may be reviewed by the sec staff and must respond to comments often multiple rounds before mailing the proxy statement in a tender offer the bidder must mail offer documents to the target shareholders at least 20 business days before the offer s scheduled expiration in a tender offer there is no prior filing with the sec though sec staff may review the tender offer during the pendency of the offer and can require supplemental disclosure which on rare occasions requires an extension of the offer period taxation and acquisition vehicles typical tax issues and structuring what are some of the typical tax issues involved in real estate business combinations and to what extent do these typically drive structuring considerations are there certain considerations that stem from the tax status of a target tax issues may be relevant for selling shareholders acquirers or the target company many of the issues are the same as those relevant for m a transactions generally for selling shareholders one major question is whether the transaction is a taxable transaction eg a cash acquisition or is tax free eg a corporate reorganisation or a contribution to a partnership acquirers often want a step up in tax basis available in a taxable asset acquisition rather than a carryover basis where reits are acquired it may be possible to liquidate the reit and obtain an asset basis step up transactions may also trigger real property transfer taxes mortgage recording taxes or reassessment of the real property in private m a transactions there are generally negotiations over the allocation of taxes pre and post closing and over contingent tax risks eg whether a reit election was properly in effect because of the widely different characteristics and requirements of different types of entities differing tax considerations may apply if the target is a us corporation reit or partnership mitigating tax risk what measures are normally taken to mitigate typical tax risks in a real estate business combination as with any m a transaction before entering a definitive agreement acquirers generally engage in due diligence to obtain a better understanding of the corporate and tax structure of a target and any tax and other contingent exposures of the target in public company transactions due diligence is typically conducted prior to signing the purchase agreement after signing very few matters rise to the level of allowing the acquirer to refuse to close based upon its findings tax issues often drive m a transaction structuring whether the acquisition is a stock acquisition or an asset acquisition whether consideration is stock or cash which company survives a merger and how financing is structured this is true in all m a transactions although often more stark in a real estate m a transaction because of firpta and the special tax characteristics of partnerships and reits types of acquisition vehicle what form of acquisition vehicle is typically used in connection with a real estate business combination and does the form vary depending on structuring alternatives or structure of the target company the acquisition vehicle form varies and can include one or more corporations limited liability companies and limited partnerships the selection of the acquisition vehicle and whether additional newly formed entities that participate in the acquisition are necessary depends on a variety of factors including the current corporate structure of the parties tax considerations financing requirements and the intended structure of the company following closing for example if the target is an upreit as discussed in question 1 the acquirer may want to keep the structure in place following closing which may require a merger of the reit with an acquiring corporation and the merger of the operating limited partnership with an acquiring limited partnership take private transactions board considerations in take private transactions what issues typically face boards of real estate public companies considering a take private transaction do these considerations vary according to the structure of the target a traditional take private transaction involves a controlling shareholder acquiring the company it controls if a controlling shareholder of a delaware corporation tries to take the corporation private the transaction will generally be subject to entire fairness judicial review entire fairness includes fairness of price and process and to help establish the fair process aspect the target board normally establishes a special committee of independent directors ie non management directors unaffiliated with the controlling shareholder that can retain advisers negotiate and reject any offer the court will not apply entire fairness review if the controlling shareholder makes the transaction irrevocably subject to approval by both a special committee and holders of a majority of unaffiliated shareholders in both cases with full disclosure normally a special committee process will also be followed in connection with any take private of a maryland reit in any acquisition by a controlling shareholder or other target affiliate in addition to tender offer rules or proxy rules described in question 7 additional sec disclosure will be required under rule 13e 3 unless an exemption is available time frame for take private transactions how long do take private transactions typically take in the context of a public real estate business what are the major milestones in this process what factors could expedite or extend the process as discussed above going private transactions typically involve the establishment of a special committee of independent directors which retains advisers and subsequently negotiates this post agreement process generally takes one to three months to reach agreement but can take longer in one step mergers proxy statements including additional information required by rule 13e 3 are prepared and filed with the sec subject to sec review and mailed to shareholders prior to the shareholders meeting this post agreement process generally takes another three to four months if instead the bidder commenced a tender offer before or in connection with making its offer to the board the special committee review or negotiation process can run concurrently with the tender offer in that event once an agreement with the special committee and board is revealed it may be possible for the tender offer s offer to purchase containing additional information required by rule 13e 3 and other filings to be amended likely requiring about one week and the tender offer may be completed 10 business days after amended filings reflecting such agreement are made negotiation non binding agreements are non binding preliminary agreements before the execution of a definitive agreement typical in real estate business combinations and does this depend on the ownership structure of the target can such non binding agreements be judicially enforced letters of intent lois also called memoranda of understanding are rarely utilised in acquisitions of public real estate companies but are quite common for private companies while such agreements are typically non binding there are a number of provisions that parties typically include as binding obligations including confidentiality non circumvention choice of law exclusivity and expense provisions courts as a general matter respect provisions contained in lois that are intended to be enforceable so long as the terms of the loi are clearly and unambiguously non binding courts will respect the agreement of the parties if however a party challenges the non binding nature of the loi and the loi is ambiguous courts will review and may find aspects of the letter to be enforceable so long as they contain all relevant material terms for these reasons it is a good practice to clearly state in the loi that it is non binding except with respect to the specified provisions in order to avoid ambiguity and potentially damages notwithstanding the terms of a loi most jurisdictions in the us recognise a general obligation of all parties to a transaction to negotiate in good faith although public real estate companies rarely enter into a loi to avoid being required to publicly disclose its content they will require the target to enter into a non disclosure agreement and in some cases will agree to enter into an exclusivity agreement for a short period of time to give the target time to formulate a proposal typical provisions describe some of the provisions contained in a purchase agreement that are specific to real estate business combinations describe any standard provisions that are contained in such agreements real estate m a purchase agreements are substantially similar to purchase agreements for other business combinations however real estate m a agreements often include additional property specific r ws including with respect to the status of the target s ownership rights to the real property existing liens on real properties existing leases and insurance affecting the real property these r ws force the target to disclose diligence materials prior to signing qualifications to these representations are based upon target s knowledge and the level of materiality necessary to cause a breach of the agreement are common purchase agreements also include closing conditions in general closing conditions fall into the following four categories regulatory related matters eg antitrust clearance and cfius required shareholder approval required deliverables eg in some reit acquisitions delivery of tax opinions and the absence of a material adverse change of the target these closing conditions are typically significantly negotiated and in particular with respect to the determination of a material adverse change are the subject of the negotiated exceptions the target typically covenants to continue operating its business in the ordinary course between signing and closing which typically prohibits incurring debt selling or acquiring properties or undertaking major capital projects in real estate m a deals involving reits the seller may also covenant to not take actions that would compromise its reit status stakebuilding are there any limitations on a buyer s ability to gradually acquire an interest in a public company in the context of a real estate business combination are these limitations typically built into organisational documents or inherent in applicable state or regulatory related regimes as discussed in question 11 there may be limitations on a buyer s ability to acquire an interest due to limitations within the target s organisational documents or a shareholder rights plan in any event if the target has more than a minimal amount of any non real property assets before acquiring more than us 80 8 million of stock subject to a cost of living based adjustment annually the acquirer must obtain prior clearance by one of the us antitrust authorities pursuant to the hart scott rodino act also if 5 per cent or more of the stock is acquired the buyer will need to make a public filing with the sec on schedule 13d within 10 days containing specified information certainty of closing describe some of the key issues that typically arise between a seller and a buyer when negotiating the purchase agreement for a real estate business combination with an emphasis on building in certainty of closing how are these issues typically resolved public real estate m a transactions typically include an array of deal protections and closing conditions that are heavily negotiated no shop covenants are often included which prevent the target from soliciting bids from other potential acquirers but such provisions are uniformly subject to fiduciary out provisions allowing the board to provide information to and negotiate with another bidder sometimes particularly in private equity deals the parties agree to go shop provisions that allow the target to affirmatively solicit competing bids for a limited period of time and if that process leads to a superior deal during that period or sometimes even later if with a bidder who had surfaced during that period then the size of the termination fee is significantly reduced under a no shop or a go shop if a superior proposal surfaces the bidder normally has matching rights for several days before the target board is permitted to exercise its rights to withdraw its recommendation of the original deal and if it has actual termination rights before it can exercise such rights termination or break up fees payable by the target see question 10 somewhat reduce the bidder s risk of a competing bid and provide some compensation if it is outbid also heavily negotiated are the target s rights if the acquirer fails to close whether because of breach or a failure of its lenders to fund even though the acquirer did not breach see question 29 another heavily negotiated provision in real estate m a purchase agreements is the exact scope of the ubiquitous closing condition that the target not have suffered a material adverse effect that is continuing as of the closing environmental liability who typically bears responsibility for environmental remediation following the closing of a real estate business combination what contractual provisions regarding environmental liability do parties usually agree in public company sales including public reits the acquired company continues to have the pre closing liabilities and the selling shareholders retain no liability post closing the acquirer typically has the right to inspect the properties to gauge the scope of its potential liability and may require the target to perform environmental testing of the properties to assess liability in some cases the parties may negotiate environmental insurance coverage for known cleanup issues other typical liability issues what other liability issues are typically major points of negotiation in the context of a real estate business combination as described in question 22 in a public company real estate acquisition the selling shareholders do not retain any liability or risk of liability post closing conversely in the context of a private m a deal the sellers will often retain some risk of pre closing liabilities the scope of the liability risk the sellers agree to keep post closing is the subject of significant negotiation issues include the threshold of damages giving rise to a claim the cap on overall damages and the way in which the seller gives the acquirer comfort that it will be able to perform its obligation eg establishing an escrow arrangement a holdback by the target or by delivering a guarantee from a creditworthy entity sellers representations regarding leases in the context of a real estate business combination what are the typical representations and covenants made by a seller regarding existing and new leases common lease related r ws include those relating to whether there are any defaults under leases in place any outstanding amounts owed to tenants under the leases and whether the leases contain any right for the tenant to purchase an individual property typically there will be a covenant in the purchase agreement preventing the target from entering into any new lease or leases above certain thresholds between signing and closing and restrictions on terminating existing leases due diligence legal due diligence describe the legal due diligence required in the context of a real estate business combination and any due diligence specific to a real estate business combination what specialists are typically involved and at what point in the transaction are the various teams typically brought in the scope and degree of due diligence depends on the target s portfolio of real estate assets in a public real estate m a deal if the target s portfolio consists of a limited number of material properties or includes a few material properties among many immaterial properties the acquirer may focus only on those material properties otherwise the acquirer may perform diligence on a representative sample of properties or forego property level diligence entirely property level diligence may include reviewing the status of the target s legal title to some or all of the property eg whether a clear chain of conveyance documents evidences ownership whether there are liens on the property and whether other parties have rights to the property such as easements and reviewing change of control provisions anti assignment clauses third party consent rights termination rights or economic terms under material contracts in any real estate m a transaction research may also be conducted on the target s owners or major shareholders to determine whether the acquirer should expect resistance to the transaction in addition to the above a review of tax employment and environmental diligence will be typically be undertaken litigation related diligence may also be necessary if the target is the subject of a material litigation searches how are title lien bankruptcy litigation and tax searches typically conducted on what levels are these searches typically run what protection from bad title is available to buyers and does this depend on the nature of the underlying asset as described above the scope and degree of due diligence is a function of the target s portfolio and the acquirer s risk analysis bankruptcy tax and litigation searches are typically run by third party service providers that search multiple local and national databases to determine any issues with respect to title to the property the acquirer may engage a title insurance company to perform title searches these searches check land records and other sources to determine the current owner s state of title eg ownership and any encumbrances conditions covenants or restrictions to which such ownership is subject and any issues of which the acquirer should be aware if the target does not currently have title insurance policies the acquirer may purchase the policies which provide coverage against claims by third parties against an owner s title to real property representation and warranty insurance do sellers of non public real estate businesses typically purchase representation and warranty insurance to cover post closing liability r w insurance is available for purchase in the us to cover liability to the purchaser for breaches of a seller s r ws such insurance is typically used as a replacement for seller s obligation to indemnify purchaser for such liability and is often used in the context of transactions involving privately held business combinations however such insurance has not become widely used in privately held real estate entity combinations unless a significant tax issue is involved in that case insurance is purchased to cover seller s liability for the specific tax related r ws review of business contracts what are some of the primary agreements that the legal teams customarily review in the context of a real estate business combination and does the scope vary with the structure of the transaction typically acquirers will review some or all of the leases and other contracts entered into by the real estate owning entity as part of its due diligence the primary concern regarding material contracts and leases is whether the target s counterparty has a termination or consent right that will be triggered by a change of control or assignment resulting from the transaction depending on the transaction each material agreement or a specified selection of agreements will receive individual analysis an acquirer may also review individual leases and agreements for their economic terms which may be fundamental to the underlying m a transaction breach of contract remedies for breach of contract what are the typical remedies for breach of a contract in the context of a real estate business combination and do they vary with the ownership of target or the structure of the transaction in real estate m a deals involving a publicly traded reit or other company the acquirer does not have the benefit of post closing breach of contract remedies such as surviving r ws and indemnities the target s remedies only protect against the risk of the acquirer breaching the purchase agreement or being unable to close prior to termination of the purchase agreement the target may have the right to specific performance to enforce the acquirer s obligations under the purchase agreement in deals that are strategic combinations eg the merger of two reits specific performance may entail forcing the acquirer to close the transaction regardless of the availability of funding for the deal in deals involving the acquisition of a reit by a private fund specific performance may be limited by the availability of the acquirer s funding source after termination of the purchase agreement the target may pursue damages for the acquirer s breach or for certain breaches or certain failures to close not involving a breach may be entitled to a reverse break up fee in strategic combinations the target s claims may not be capped whereas in acquisitions by private funds such claims may be capped at a reverse break up fee amount with all claims released upon payment of such fee the parties negotiate which breaches survive termination and which do not damages may be defined to clarify that damages are not limited to the target s own damages largely just expenses but include shareholders expectations of the deal premium financing market overview how does a buyer typically finance real estate business combinations transactions may be financed by real estate secured debt corporate debt such as syndicated bank debt or corporate bonds or a combination of both the financing arrangement for a transaction depends on among other considerations the size of the transaction interest rate environment the terms of existing financing at target and whether the acquirer is required or permitted to assume the target s current debt procurement of financing is almost never a closing condition but the target and acquirer typically require a commitment letter from a lender or other evidence of availability of funds before signing the purchase agreement seller s obligations what are the typical obligations of the seller in the financing the target or seller in a private transaction usually insists that the acquirer has a firm financing commitment which is often not the financing that is ultimately incurred at closing the target typically agrees to cooperate with the acquirer s efforts to obtain better financing and the lenders syndication efforts the parties may negotiate that upon provision of certain required information by the target and the satisfaction of other conditions a marketing period commences in which the acquirer must complete financing and be able to close the required information varies depending on whether a deep level of property information is required and often such cooperation is limited to reasonable requests customary requirements or commercially reasonable efforts some items that may be included in financing cooperation provisions include providing historical financial statements assisting in the preparation of pro forma financial statements assisting in obtaining title insurance and surveys permitting field examinations for third party reports and appraisals providing information in connection with know your customer and anti money laundering rules senior officers reasonably participating in meetings calls presentations and other activities providing information for rating agency presentations participating in the preparation of pledge and collateral documents obtaining third party consents as required eg consents from joint venture partners and obtaining customary pay off letters repayment guarantees what repayment guarantees do lenders typically require in the context of a property level financing of a real estate business combination for what purposes are reserves usually required in the context of property level indebtedness if the transaction is financed with a loan secured by the real property lenders typically require that cash flow from the properties be used to fund debt service and reserves for the operation of the property eg taxes insurance capital improvements cash flows are either immediately or upon the occurrence of certain events including events of default and failure to meet negotiated financial thresholds eg debt yield and debt service coverage ratio held in a lender controlled account these property level loans are typically non recourse meaning the borrower s liability is generally limited to its interest in the collateral property but there are some notable exceptions lenders typically require that a creditworthy and liquid guarantor execute an indemnity for all losses related to environmental matters and a guarantee for losses arising from certain acts by the borrower eg fraud intentional misrepresentation and the entire debt under very limited circumstances eg bankruptcy of the borrower or an impermissible transfer of the property corporate style loans are typically recourse to the target and its subsidiaries through the use of guarantees and if secured often require the target to provide mortgages on its properties borrower covenants what covenants do lenders usually insist on in the context of a property level financing of a real estate business combination in the context of property level real estate secured debt the borrower usually a special purpose subsidiary of the target typically undertakes covenants to operate the properties in the ordinary course maintain existing contracts permits and leases and not take any action to impair the assets typical equity financing provisions what equity financing provisions are common in a transaction involving a real estate business that is being taken private does it depend on the structure of the buyer the need for debt financing to facilitate going private real estate related transactions adds risks that must be addressed and allocated between the parties given their structures and investment theses private equity funds want to ensure that they are only obligated to close if the debt financing materializes in the us the customary market practice is to allocate this risk by including no express financing closing condition and allowing the target to force the private equity fund to draw on its equity to close the deal only if debt financing has or will be funded the target is given the right to terminate the purchase agreement if the acquirer fails to close the deal when required if the target terminates the acquirer pays a reverse break up fee and sometimes reimburses the target s expenses often capped typically payment of a reverse break up fee caps the acquirer s liability for its failure to close this provides the private equity fund with comfort that it is not liable beyond the reverse break up fee and target s expenses while allowing the target to look to a capitalised counterparty in the event of termination collective investment schemes reits are real estate investment trusts reits that have tax saving advantages available are there particular legal considerations that shape the formation and activities of reits reits in the us are tax advantaged in that they are corporations that can eliminate or substantially eliminate their corporate taxation so long as they pay dividends equal to their taxable income domestically controlled reits are not treated as us real property for the purposes of firpta where appropriate therefore reits are often desirable qualifying for reit status imposes a number of limitations however on the ownership and governance of the reit the assets it can hold the income it can receive and the activities it performs as a result there can be significant compliance burdens incident to reit status and substantial limitations on its assets and activities so reits should only be used where it is also appropriate from a business perspective private equity funds are there particular legal considerations that shape the formation and activities of real estate focused private equity funds does this vary depending on the target assets or investors private equity funds often have investors with widely varying characteristics including foreign sovereigns other foreign investors us tax exempt investors or us taxable investors each type of investor has its own considerations for example foreign sovereigns are often sensitive to whether they will be treated as engaged in commercial activities foreign investors are sensitive to whether they will be treated as engaged in a us trade or business us tax exempt investors are sensitive to whether they will receive unrelated business taxable income and us taxable investors are sensitive to the timing and character of the income and losses they are allocated private equity funds therefore are often structured using parallel partnerships or sleeves using blocker corporations as appropriate or organising reits to hold assets the appropriate structure is driven by the characteristics and concerns of the investors and the types of assets being invested in and their expected return profiles
with the future of the global order hanging in the balance 2019 is set to become a transformative year where history turns but with no one yet sure of the outcome america and china may now find a way out of their current trade war but the long term battle for technological superiority has only just begun no less dangerous are festering long standing disputes between america and north korea india and pakistan iran and saudi arabia and russia and the west the latter of which is exacerbating unrest in many of the world s hotspots not least ukraine and syria easing these tensions is essential for global stability and our collective economic prospects the 2008 financial crisis was resolved as a result of intense international co operation with the co ordination back then giving way to the confrontations of 2019 will any future global downturn see anything like those levels of monetary and fiscal co operation will central banks again co operate through co ordinated interest rate cuts and currency swaps would the g20 join together to fight protectionism and agree the same kind of fiscal stimulus that 10 years ago restored confidence in the global economy would china ever again aid a western recovery with a repeat of its massive stimulus package the retreat into nationalism raises further questions about why globalisation which aimed to break down barriers and open up the world has brought increased protectionism and why the public now sees it akin to a runaway train i fear that as of today the answer to these questions is a sweeping no countries would be more likely to blame each other for what s gone wrong than act together to put things right any consideration of a future downturn shows the world is not only facing cyclical challenges but structural challenges too in particular the retreat into nationalism which in turn raises further questions about why globalisation which aimed to break down barriers and open up the world has brought increased protectionism and why the public now sees it akin to a runaway train that is out of control in the unipolar age america preferred to act multilaterally now in the multipolar age america prefers to act unilaterally and as america turns away from multilateralism china is already beginning to reshape geopolitics on its own change is upon us so what kind of future will we build unless the west can find a way of managing our multipolar world in a multilateral way china which has already created the asian infrastructure investment bank and is contemplating an asian monetary fund might accelerate the development of different or parallel structures for international economic decision making that potentially rival existing international institutions we know that in the last few decades as the centre of gravity of the world economy has started its shift from west to east the global economy has been changing out of all recognition before the crisis nearly 60 per cent of manufacturing trade and investment and indeed total economic activity as a whole was in the west now 60 per cent is outside the west with asia certain to command an even bigger share up to 40 per cent in the decades to come manufacturing will never again enjoy the same share of employment as in the past or as services do today and the talk is of premature deindustrialisation while the world s middle class those on the world bank s calculation with income above 10 per capita a day will form a global majority the shift of income and wealth to the top 1 per cent and from labour to capital makes both inequality and economic insecurity far bigger sources of concern furthermore once homogeneous countries are becoming heterogeneous raising concerns about cultural identity and of course like many other challenges ahead environmental pollution which is no respecter of borders cannot be addressed without cross border co operation neither can financial instability and the contagion it causes or the increased use of tax havens be adequately met and mastered by nation states even the most powerful ones acting on their own indeed all the new 21st century challenges from cybersecurity and the splinternet to pandemics are global problems that need global solutions and i am convinced that if we embrace this truth then the next step is to reform our 75 year old international institutions to make them fit for purpose and better able to respond to the crises ahead how we manage these changes is the subject i will address in my contribution to ideas abu dhabi gordon brown is un special envoy for global education and former prime minister of the uk he will be speaking at ideas abu dhabi tomorrow at new york university abu dhabi

revenue yields gross cruise costs per albd and u s gaap net income and u s gaap earnings per share net revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity or albd changes from price and other changes that affect our business we believe these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our u s gaap consolidated financial statements under u s gaap the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are recognized currently in earnings we believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings therefore we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these unrealized gains and losses we believe that gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges restructuring and other expenses are not part of our core operating business and are not an indication of our future earnings performance therefore we believe it is more meaningful for gains and losses on ship sales impairment charges and restructuring and other non core gains and charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and accordingly we present adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share excluding these items the presentation of our non gaap financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation from as substitute for or superior to the financial information prepared in accordance with u s gaap it is possible that our non gaap financial measures may not be exactly comparable to the like kind information presented by other companies which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise industry to measure a company s cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes we use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields we believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our most significant variable costs which are travel agent commissions cost of air and other transportation certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit and debit card fees net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross passenger ticket revenues net of commissions transportation and other costs net onboard and other revenues reflect gross onboard and other revenues net of onboard and other cruise costs net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd is the measure we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segments costs rather than gross cruise costs per albd we exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues as well as fuel expense to calculate net cruise costs without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non gaap financial measures substantially all of our net cruise costs excluding fuel are largely fixed except for the impact of changing prices once the number of albds has been determined reconciliation of forecasted data we have not provided a reconciliation of forecasted gross cruise revenues to forecasted net cruise revenues or forecasted gross cruise costs to forecasted net cruise costs without fuel or forecasted u s gaap net income to forecasted adjusted net income or forecasted u s gaap earnings per share to forecasted adjusted earnings per share because preparation of meaningful u s gaap forecasts of gross cruise revenues gross cruise costs net income and earnings per share would require unreasonable effort we are unable to predict without unreasonable effort the future movement of foreign exchange rates and fuel prices we are unable to determine the future impact of gains or losses on ships sales restructuring expenses and other non core gains and charges constant dollar and constant currency our operations primarily utilize the u s dollar australian dollar euro and sterling as functional currencies to measure results and financial condition functional currencies other than the u s dollar subject us to foreign currency translational risk our operations also have revenues and expenses that are in currencies other than their functional currency which subject us to foreign currency transactional risk we report net revenue yields net passenger revenue yields net onboard and other revenue yields and net cruise costs excluding fuel per albd on a constant dollar and constant currency basis assuming the 2019 periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2018 periods rates these metrics facilitate a comparative view for the changes in our business in an environment with fluctuating exchange rates constant dollar reporting removes only the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations constant currency reporting removes the impact of changes in exchange rates on the translation of our operations as in constant dollar plus the transactional impact of changes in exchange rates from revenues and expenses that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency examples the translation of our operations with functional currencies other than u s dollar to our u s dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported u s dollar revenues and expenses if the u s dollar weakens against these foreign currencies our operations have revenue and expense transactions in currencies other than their functional currency if their functional currency strengthens against these other currencies it reduces the functional currency revenues and expenses if the functional currency weakens against these other currencies it increases the functional currency revenues and expenses

by jacob wolinsky valuewalk whitney tilson s email to investors discussing one of stansberry research s top gurus steve sjuggerud is very bullish on chinese stocks and a bull and a bear on tesla china is rapidly changing the war to end poverty is being won seriously why up to 2 2 trillion is about to pour into chinese stocks sjug s bold new prediction you ll want a guiding hand in this i vic lederman couldn t believe my eyes last june steve sjuggerud and i traveled 754 miles by train from beijing to shanghai about the same distance as new york to chicago but unlike taking a 19 hour amtrak train in the u s the trip in china took less than five hours it may surprise you to hear that china is living in the future and the u s is playing catch up the train wasn t even the most shocking part of the trip though it was the little villages that we sped by it s the view of china that most americans expect out there you get a glimpse of the country s working poor but next to each village we saw something odd new construction interrupted the chinese countryside nearly every time how do they build so much at once i wondered we d pass a little village right next to it would be clusters of cranes each one working on a massive building in late 2017 chinese president xi jinping set a lofty goal of ending poverty by 2020 that sounded farfetched at first but it s working china is literally lifting its citizens out of the dirt and up into the sky it started with economic reforms in the 1990s since then it has lifted some 800 million people out of poverty it s worth noting that china s poverty line is 2 300 renminbi a year around 350 in u s dollars about 30 million people are still below the chinese poverty line now the push is to get those folks above the threshold this isn t just one politician s promise though it has been the entire party s focus for decades now the results are already starting to show up in the economic data all you need to do is look at china s growth in per capita gross domestic product gdp gdp is a general measure of a country s economic activity from 1990 to 2016 the latest data we have china s economic output has grown more than 2 000 compared with china the u s looks like it s standing still take a look china is getting wealthier and it s happening fast you can see it through the construction in the countryside and the upscale commerce of the city centers yet most americans don t see the opportunity they still see the old china of 30 plus years ago as a result almost no one is talking about the major change that s taking place in china s stock market trillions of dollars are set to flow into chinese stocks as regular digest readers know a major shift is coming a weird quirk in the financial markets is pushing investors into china whether they like it or not you see for decades the biggest investors in the world have steered clear of china and not for the reasons you d expect it wasn t because of debt or the housing market it wasn t due to human rights or any other chinese economic boogeyman the reason was simple chinese stocks weren t part of the global stock indexes they hadn t been added to the list the reasons behind that are complicated and esoteric but it meant that no foreign passive investments ever made their way to china it was one of the biggest financial wrongs of modern times and it was bound to be righted at first steve was the only one telling this story but now global investment bank morgan stanley ms is starting to get on board it started with a cryptic bloomberg headline which read china a shares will be one tenth foreign owned in ten years ms that might not sound so dramatic but in reality it s a huge deal and it means up to 2 2 trillion is set to flow into china in the years to come steve was so sure about this that he launched his true wealth opportunities china newsletter in late 2016 only the most adventurous and open minded stansberry research readers were interested but those early adopters were handsomely rewarded the true wealth opportunities china portfolio had a win rate of 72 last year and on average its trades returned 20 those are impressive numbers on their own but when you know that china suffered a massive pullback in 2018 they re downright incredible we re extremely proud of the a grade true wealth opportunities china received in the most recent report card and the a grade we got in the 2017 report card there s a catch though most of those gains came from a boom in chinese tech stocks the bigger shift in china hadn t begun yet today we re in a different environment global stocks u s and china included are recovering from a correction and once again investors are spooked that s great news it means the setup in china is better than it ever has been before today morgan stanley is predicting massive inflows of foreign money into china as bloomberg reported morgan stanley sees foreign ownership of china a shares reaching about 10 in 10 years from the current level of 2 6 with annual a share inflows normalizing at around 100 220 until now the big u s investment firms had been nearly silent on this now we know what wall street really thinks and morgan stanley is starting to make some bold predictions 220 billion per year would mean more than 2 trillion could ultimately flow into chinese a shares over the next decade still most investors haven t picked up on this yet this unique situation caused steve to make another big prediction in the february issue of true wealth opportunities china as he wrote this is huge news and it gives us the perfect opportunity to put new money to work right now as i ve said for years we know a flood of money is heading into chinese a shares so let s get our money there first i believe we will see a triple digit gain within an 18 month period sometime over the next five years thanks to the shift morgan stanley sees coming and that s likely a major understatement china has a history of soaring hundreds of percent quickly and a couple trillion dollars in inflows is the kind of thing that could kick off a frenzy of course we can t just blindly hold a shares for years while the shift occurs that s too risky considering how extremely volatile chinese stocks tend to be what we want to do is be invested when the uptrend is in our favor and step aside when things get tough if you re going to put a single dollar to work in chinese stocks you need steve s guidance steve has repeatedly called the opportunity in chinese stocks the biggest investment opportunity of his lifetime i believe him i ve visited china with steve twice now i ve seen it all firsthand the shift taking place in china is multigenerational we likely won t see anything like this again in our lifetimes steve has been preparing for this since 2016 and he has assembled a list of stocks and funds to best take advantage of this massive shift massive changes are coming in the chinese markets up to 2 2 trillion

words from a longtime subscriber as always send your notes to i enjoyed thomas carroll s report in the stansberry digest on tuesday it reminded me of my retail days as a broker 35 years ago i had just changed firms to ef hutton a hot firm at the time with a great ad campaign featuring john housman i believe who would with regal authority finish each ad with when ef hutton talks people listen a perfect hook demanding attention if you were a client anyway a couple of months after i joined the firm they had a squawk box alert on a small cap over the counter stock that their fundamental analyst spoke glowing about its prospects for about 10 minutes a long time for impatient brokers that was followed by another 5 minutes by one of their technical with a pitch about its chart patterns and how the stock was poised to break out with new momentum to all time highs yada yada i called a friend of mine before the market opened at another firm kidder peabody at the time and told him of our squawk box alert because i knew he followed the stock also he thanked and we watched the stock start moving after the opening but then i got a return call from him 2 hours or so later his comment was their firm s trader had called him back after he alerted the trader earlier about hutton s interest in the company to say that hutton had been on the sell side of the stock all morning nice shorting into your recommendation i left hutton after less than 6 months because i couldn t shake the idea that their approach to clients was sell them something and cast the bodies overboard oh and that company doggone the luck bankrupt in less than 6 months in my years in retail through 3 firms i could name 2 technical analysts and 2 maybe 3 fundamental analysts i would even bother reading what they put out that has all changed since i ve become an alliance member welcome aboard tom paid up stansberry alliance member t t each interest rate hike takes at least 6 months to work its way into our economy

compared to 126 990 ounces in 2017 the increased gold production was driven by continued improved operating performance in both the mine and processing plant during 2018 351 689 tonnes of ore at 11 7 g t were extracted from the underground mine along with completing 5 826 metres of development compared to 319 855 tonnes of ore at 13 6 g t and 6 819 metres of development in 2017 the mining tonnage increase of 10 was due to more areas available to extract ore and additional equipment increasing productivity during 2018 approximately 92 of ore produced came from stoping activities which is a result of the extensive development that is in place at yaramoko in 2018 decline development at the mine reached the 4913 level approximately 400 metres below surface ore development was completed between the 5049 and 4913 levels the mine continues to be well positioned to meet future production requirements with developed reserves for stoping in line with the company s 18 months planned stoping objectives reconciliation of mined material against the company s resource model and grade control model was within the expected range the grade control model to actual mined shows slightly more ounces produced driven by marginally more tonnes produced the resource model is also performing within the limits of the resource classification an updated resource model will be issued in q2 2019 incorporating an additional 41 000 metres of infill and deep drilling the plant processed a record 307 591 tonnes at an average head grade of 13 5 g t in 2018 compared to 266 599 tonnes of ore at 15 3 g t in 2017 this 15 increase is a result of ongoing optimisation at the plant and translates into a unit throughput rate which is 14 above nameplate capacity plant availability was 95 4 and overall recovery was 98 6 in 2018 compared to 96 0 and 98 9 respectively for the prior year c financial performance gold sales1 in 2018 totalled 169 172 000 from 133 030 ounces of gold1 during this
