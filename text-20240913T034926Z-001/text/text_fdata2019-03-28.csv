of 1 2736 to 1 at 31 december 2018 and 1 3528 to 1 at 31 december 2017 the company s performance benchmark the msci em latin america index may be calculated on either a gross or a net return basis net return nr indices calculate the reinvestment of dividends net of withholding taxes using the tax rates applicable to non resident institutional investors and hence give a lower total return than indices where calculations are on a gross basis which assumes that no withholding tax is suffered as the company is subject to withholding tax rates for the majority of countries in which it invests the nr basis is felt to be the most accurate appropriate consistent and fair comparison for the company historically the benchmark data for the company has always been stated on a gross basis however going forward it is the board s intention to monitor the company s performance with reference to the nr version of the benchmark for transparency both sets of benchmark data have been provided in the performance data contained in this year end financial report the table showing the nav and share price return for the five year period to 31 december 2018 along with the benchmark return for the same period on both a gross and net basis can be found on page 3 of the annual report chairman s statement dear shareholder i am pleased to present the annual report to shareholders for the year ended 31 december 2018 market overview latin american markets were characterised by volatility in 2018 with the msci em latin america index net return with dividends reinvested falling by 6 6 stock markets in the region s largest economy brazil were marginally down over the year 0 5 but this masked a rollercoaster ride as markets fell by 18 6 in the first half of the year impacted by concerns over the presidential elections and the truck drivers strike in may the market bounced back in the second half of 2018 mainly due to the election of jair bolsonaro as president in october which investors viewed in a positive light in mexico markets fell by 15 5 over the year under review due to concerns about the election of a more populist president andres manuel lópez obrador and the re negotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta these developments combined with interest rate increases to combat persistent inflation created a challenging climate for the domestic equity market markets in the andean region performed poorly over the year in colombia and chile markets fell by 11 5 and 19 7 respectively mainly due to commodity prices which fell on the back of concerns over chinese growth in argentina the stock market also fell by over 50 in the year with high inflation and currency weakness driving the collapse all percentages are total return in us dollar terms on 25

details of the factors affecting performance are set out in the investment manager s report gearing the board s view is that 105 of net asset value is the neutral level of gearing over the longer term and that gearing should be used actively in an approximate range of plus or minus 10 around this as measured at the time that gearing is instigated these current parameters sit within the company s gearing policy as set out in the investment policy in the annual report which states that net borrowings are not expected to exceed 25 of net assets under normal circumstances and the company s articles of association which limit net borrowings to 100 of capital and reserves average gearing for the year to 31 december 2018 was 108 7 and as at the year end the company was geared by 108 9 revenue return and dividends total revenue return for the year was 15 13 cents per share 2017 13 03 cents per share the increase was largely due to a higher level of special dividends received in the year which accounted for 2 cents per share of total revenue return 2017 0 4 cents per share with effect from july 2018 and as part of the board s overall strategy to reduce the discount at which the company s shares trade a new dividend policy was implemented whereby the company would pay a regular quarterly dividend equivalent to 1 25 of the company s us dollar nav at the end of each calendar quarter the company has paid interim dividends totalling 23 55 cents per share under this policy in respect of the year ended 31 december 2018 as detailed in the table below this represented a yield of 4 2 based on the company s share price at 31 december 2018 had the policy been in place for the full 12 month period and assuming a dividend had been paid based on 1 25 of the nav at 31 march 2018 the yield would have been 6 0 under the company s new dividend policy dividends are calculated based on 1 25 of the us dollar nav at close of business on the last working day of march june september and december and are paid in may august november and february respectively dividends will be financed through a combination of available net income in each financial year and revenue and capital reserves dividend pay date quarter to 30 june 2018 7 57 cents 23 august 2018 quarter to 30 september 2018 7 85 cents 9 november 2018 quarter to 31 december 2018 8 13 cents 8 february 2019 total 23 55

ordinary shares in sterling terms has averaged 14 5 and ranged between 10 8 and 20 6 the board has tried to reduce this volatility by offering shareholders a discount control mechanism covering the four years to 31 december 2021 whereby shareholders are offered a tender for 24 99 per cent of the shares in issue excluding treasury shares at a tender price reflecting the latest cum income nav less 2 per cent and related portfolio realisation costs in the event that the continuation vote for each relevant biennial period is approved being the continuation votes at the agms in 2020 and 2022 where

significant economic political and currency risks due to the location of the operation of the businesses in which the company may invest shares in businesses in which the company invests can prove volatile and this may be reflected in the company s share price the company may also invest in smaller capitalisation companies or in the securities markets of developing countries which are not as large as the more established securities markets and have substantially less trading volume which may result in a lack of liquidity and higher price volatility market risk includes the potential impact of events which are outside the scope of the company s control such as the uk s decision to leave the european union the board considers asset allocation stock selection unquoted investments if

agm in 2022 if certain conditions are met the outcome of these events are unknown at the present time however notwithstanding these uncertainties given the factors stated below the board expects the company to continue for the foreseeable future and has therefore conducted this review for the period up to the agm in 2023 in choosing this period for its assessment of the viability of the company the directors have considered the following matters the company has a relatively liquid portfolio as at 31 december 2018 100 of the portfolio was estimated as being capable of being liquidated within 20 days the company s expenses and liabilities are relatively stable the company s business model should remain attractive for much longer than the period up to the agm in 2023 unless there is a significant economic or regulatory change the company s principal risks and uncertainties as set out above are unlikely to change materially the impact of a significant fall in latin american markets

for the company s shares the directors reviewed the assumptions and considerations underpinning the company s existing going concern assertion which are based on processes for monitoring costs key

manager s report market overview latin american performance was volatile throughout 2018 ending the year down 6 6 net return with dividends reinvested in usd terms making it the top performing region within the broader emerging markets complex which was down 14 6 over the same period intraregional performance was quite diverse driven by a mixture of domestic politics and negative sentiment felt across all emerging market regions brazil 0 5 the region s largest economy was subject to shifts in market sentiment for the entirety of the period whilst january was very strong with indices and flows hitting recent highs sentiment quickly tailed off following a sharp correction in the us despite improved confidence falling inflation and further central bank rate cuts in the beginning of the year brazil declined 18 6 by the end of the first half of 2018 as volatility spiked following the may truckers strike and uncertainty surrounding presidential elections grew brazil recovered sharply in the second half of the year primarily due to the election of jair bolsonaro on 28 october on this note brazil s performance resisted the sharp deterioration in global equities through the fourth quarter of 2018 with brazilian currency movements responsible for about 50 of equity gains in usd while data for the year was mixed signs of an economic rebound persist mexico 15 5 was plagued by stubborn inflation leading to a hawkish central bank earlier in the period while complexity surrounding nafta negotiations continued to put pressure on the currency although the market showed resiliency in the second quarter with uncertainty surrounding the presidential race declining volatility picked up following the cancellation of the partially built new airport in mexico city the naim project and increased concerns over how president lópez obrador s administration will try to pass policy following the transition period into 2019 performance in colombia 11 5 and chile 19 7 was primarily dictated by commodity prices which continued a downward trend into year end fuelled by concerns over chinese growth peru 1 6 was the top performer in 2018 and was the only country in the region to end in positive territory argentina was at the opposite end of the spectrum with markets declining 50 8 in 2018 a persistently strong us dollar and elevated inflation led to a collapse of both the equity and fx markets in june central bank missteps to combat rising inflation led to an initial 50bn stand by arrangement with the imf to help support the currency investors remained unconvinced of the government s economic plan leading to persistent outflows through the second half of 2018 with the exception of a short lived relief rally in the third quarter following august lows portfolio review during the year the company posted a 5 4 1 decline in its nav while its share price decreased by 6 9 1 this resulted in the nav outperformance of its benchmark the msci em latin america index which returned 6 2 1 on a gross return basis and 6 6 1 on a net return basis over the same time period 1 all calculations in us dollar terms with dividends reinvested the company s strong overweight to and selection within brazil was the primary contributor to returns as the market there rallied strongly following a positive election outcome in october and attention focused on the formation of the new government large cap macro proxies such as lender banco bradesco were among the top contributors amid continued optimism surrounding an economic recovery consumption oriented names also performed well digital retailer b2w cia digital has been able to maintain progression and positive cash flow generation on its third party marketplace while linx has benefitted from an increased demand for payment software solutions budget airline operator azul also posted stronger performance benefitting from stronger than expected traffic volumes and oil price weakness later in the period the company s underweight to chile was also additive to relative performance amid commodity price declines in the second half of 2018 on the other hand the company s off benchmark exposure to argentina was the largest detractor to performance lenders supervielle and galicia were among the most affected names as the equity and fx markets were unable to find a floor despite appropriate measures taken by the government to suppress investor concerns over runaway inflation cement producer loma negra also posted heavy declines as domestic growth slowed an underweight to colombia weighed on returns as the oil dependent market surged early in the period moving alongside oil price strength the company s leverage facility and implied 105 gross notional neutral level amplified underperformance to the benchmark portfolio positioning we notably shifted risk into mexico bringing our exposure to a more neutral position we increased some exposure to chile predominantly through mining names while exiting our peruvian exposure as we found better prospects elsewhere following a severe correction in the brazilian market over the summer due to a combination of inflation concerns stemming from the may truckers strike and spill over effects of argentina s peso crisis we added to underperforming state owned enterprises soes in brazil given significant underperformance attractive valuation and our continued belief that the october election would elect a government committed to the current economic reform process at that time we trimmed exposure to off benchmark argentina as tough fiscal and cpi consumer price index targets associated with the international monetary fund imf stand by agreement are likely to result in lower growth we continue to maintain an off benchmark allocation to argentina through software exporter globant which benefitted from persistent pressure on the currency we continued to add to our brazil overweight following a positive election result primarily topping up on existing positions in macro sensitive financials on the other hand we have remained cautious on mexico amid increased political uncertainty maintaining a neutral position we have been active in taking profits across our positions and redeploying capital on market dips most recently we have also trimmed exposure across the resource sectors the company ended the period being overweight brazil while being underweight chile peru colombia and neutral mexico at the sector level we remain overweight the domestic consumer while being underweight consumer staples and utilities in determining portfolio construction focus is given to the four c s namely commodities currency consumption and credit more detail is given below commodities moderation in global growth outlook led by china improving supply discipline favours energy sector improving economic cycle in brazil allows for exposure to brazilian steel stocks no exposure to mexican mining companies due to regulatory concerns currencies outlook for appreciation in the brazilian real and stabilization in the argentinian peso leads to above benchmark exposure to brazil and argentina uncertainty on the mexican peso leads to neutral mexico positioning pressure expected on currencies in chile and peru consumption historically low interest rates moderate inflation and improving unemployment make brazilian consumer stocks attractive the new mexican administration s social programmes should support positions in mexican beverage companies convenience stores and hypermarkets the portfolio reflects a structural shift to e commerce at the expense of department stores and shopping malls credit the low level of household and corporate indebtedness allows for supportive loan growth and low level of delinquency for the brazilian bank sector lower economic activity and expensive valuations have precluded exposure to chilean banks emphasis on financial inclusion and improving credit penetration offset policy fears in mexico outlook brazil remains our largest overweight given our positive expectations for the incoming administration so far newly elected president jair bolsonaro has delivered on his campaign promises looking to reduce the size of government by initially reducing the number of ministries naming sector subject experts to lead cabinets and pointing to a continuation of the reform process initiated two years ago meanwhile the outlook for upcoming corporate results points to a continuation in the economic recovery providing strong momentum for growth into 2019 elsewhere the cancellation of the naim airport project reminded markets of the concerns regarding increasing populism for the incoming administration in mexico reiterating our cautiousness with mexican equities we remain underweight in the andean region due to a combination of unattractive valuation and disappointing growth finally the dramatic sell off in argentina in 2018 leaves the stocks trading at attractive valuations while interest rates and fx have mostly stabilised providing a foundation for the economy to rebound from recent downturn sam vecht ed kuczma blackrock

is the british government going to ignore the will of their citizens and not leave the eu the eu s immigration policies are sparking political backlash and citizens are taking to the streets in january bloomberg reported mario draghi sounds economic alarm for the euro area citing persistence of geopolitical uncertainties what in the world is going on it s time to turn to the international member of our panel of experts rob vrijhof managing partner of weber hartmann vrijhof partners ltd swiss international asset managers for a worldwide perspective dennis rob thank you for taking your time to help educate our readers it s impossible to look at the investment markets without factoring in the worldwide political environment before we get into investment details can you bring us up to date on what s happening in europe and the investment implications rob dennis thank you for the opportunity to talk to your readers there are some dark clouds hanging over europe s head especially the never ending brexit issue great britain and the european union eu are still far apart after two years of discussions we expect an extension of the march 29th deadline hard brexit soft brexit or even a new referendum only time will tell the yellow vests protesting in france continue despite president macron giving in to some of their requests the immense victory of president macron is certainly fading away today there is no end of these protests in sight the european central bank ecb isn t helping either mr draghi is still saying europe will not fall into a recession he feels no pressure to start a cycle of rising interest rates this will eventually cause problems for europe we believe that the us economy will fall into a recession probably during the second half of 2020 and will be followed by europe while the fed has some wiggle room to lower interest rates the ecb doesn t we will be monitoring these developments very carefully dennis recently federal reserve chairman powell urged lawmakers to address unsustainable debt then he added uncertainty is the enemy of business it could get even worse if congress does not lift the debt ceiling in the coming months address unsustainable debt but make it easy for politicians to borrow more at the end of fiscal year 2018 us gross federal debt was 107 1 of gdp trading economics forecasts the eu to come in around 86 of gdp when you look at individual countries greece 178 6 italy 132 1 and portugal 125 7 are leading the pack france 97 0 the uk 85 3 and germany 63 9 look pretty good rob are europeans tired of bailing out the heavily indebted countries i commend the swiss people for having the foresight to stay independent when does debt become unsustainable the eu is punishing the uk for trying to leave do you see them letting other members exit if the top three debtor nations left the eu wouldn t it be a positive sign for the euro what do you see on the horizon rob i agree uncertainty is the enemy of business debt be that private or governments is an immense problem eventually someone will have to pick up the check or get stuck with huge losses while private debt can become unsustainable i wonder about government debt twenty years ago we would be firmly convinced that today s debt levels were not only unsustainable that a collapse would have happened long before now many of us who own gold anticipated high inflation coming soon greece is at a level of 178 6 which seems impossible to work out from under yet the past two government bond issues were oversubscribed they sold like hot cakes as long as there are lenders willing to take a risk things will continue common sense says eventually lenders stop lending and high inflation will occur a lot of pundits have been wrong in their predictions about the timing i find it impossible to forecast when this will happen switzerland not being part of the eu has stable growth numbers and much lower unemployment levels than most european countries i don t expect the swiss will join the eu our independence and the swiss franc will be here for many years to come while the eu is making brexit very difficult the brits have not handled the brexit in a positive fashion either the political class doing the negotiations are not in favor of brexit despite the will of the voters i doubt any other eu members are contemplating leaving after watching how brexit was handled dennis in your recent newsletter you mentioned the crazy start to the stock market this year you said however this skyrocket performance in such a short period in our eyes cannot be sustainable it further seems that investors focus only on the good news while suppressing any warning signals please elaborate on this i m asking about both the short term and long term rob the volatility we have been seeing during the past few months in stock markets precious metal and currencies is immense a level i have not seen during my three decades as a senior investment advisor we believe that this never ending bull market in stocks will come to a stop and would not be surprised to see a correction of 10 to 15 during the course of 2019 after a rocket start we are currently seeing markets trading down with economic numbers coming in slightly weaker than anticipated and expectations of lower corporate profits across the board we could be in the early stages of the anticipated correction we are currently underweight in stocks and watching economic developments closely we do have certain stocks on our watch list mainly defensive stocks with high yields nevertheless we are still holding a substantial amount of cash mainly in swiss francs despite the current strength of the us dollar we feel it is getting near the top we expect a weaker dollar in the years to come since we are talking about volatility the same is true for gold after a strong start with levels close to the important 1350 oz level gold has been trading down we need to hold levels above 1280 or it s likely to drop back to 1250 on the upside 1300 1320 would signal safe waters and should lead to much higher prices dennis what you describe is the proverbial catch 22 investors know they are on thin ice they want to participate in an up market but are wary of a sudden downturn what are you advising rob indeed we are on thin ice the bull market lasted longer than any other bull market in history while we are underweight in stocks we still hold very selective stock positions in markets around the world we are closely following stocks on our watch list and when the correction comes we are prepared to invest at that time investors should be prepared for the event when it finally arrives holding cash during this period of uncertainty is good advice you want fundamentally strong currencies even if the interest rates are a bit lower even more important during these volatile times is having your trailing stop losses in place although we are underweight in stocks and feel our holdings are strong we are well aware that many investors were caught on the wrong foot during december 2018 we want to avoid any possibility of catastrophic losses taking some money off the table with a decent gain during these times is good prudent advice look forward to new opportunities and keep your trailing stop losses in place these markets are driven by liquidity and will in the not too distant future trade down how far down and how long this looming bear market will last is impossible to say just be ready dennis i agree holding cash in reserve is a good thing in an uncertain market this is where your international pedigree really helps as interest rates are all over the map what currencies do you recommend to your clients rob as conservative investment advisors we look for currencies that we feel could rise versus the us dollar one of our favorite currencies during the past 30 years has been the swiss franc and still is we have also been investing in a variety of other currencies dennis as one of our valued clients you know we invested in russian rubles with interest rates of well above 8 we have held commodity currencies such as the australian dollar the new zealand dollar as well as the canadian dollar we are currently giving the chines yuan a very close look and do believe that the euro will start to show some strength during the second half of 2019 international currencies add a fourth dimension into your investments with our strong belief the us dollar will weaken currency diversification gives investors another layer of wealth protection we strongly believe that americans should have a part of their total wealth invested outside of the usa in foreign bonds stocks and currencies dennis rob on behalf of our readers thank you for your time rob my pleasure dennis note i have no financial arrangement with rob and his firm other than being a client i do not endorse or recommend any financial advisors to our readers why every investor has specific unique needs when it comes to investment advisors there is no one size fits all dennis here the british government recently voted to stay in the eu until they have a deal what incentive does that give the eu to bargain in good faith i m with rob i feel uncertainty is going to be prolonged until after the 2020 election take profits and keep your stop losses in place for more information

good afternoon it is a pleasure to be here at the banque de france and take part in this important symposium on the euro area staying the course through uncertainties 1 both in the financial press and in international policy circles one hears a great deal about the spillovers of u s monetary policy to other economies one hears somewhat less though about how global shocks affect the u s economy 2 so in my remarks today i will discuss how the u s economy s increasing integration with the rest of the world has made it more exposed to foreign shocks and i will focus in particular on the channels of transmission through which these shocks operate i will close with a few words on current prospects in which global crosscurrents are again posing challenges for the u s economy and monetary policy greater integration between the united states and the rest of the world the u s economy s integration with the rest of the world both in terms of trade and finance has risen substantially over the past 60 years since the 1960s both u s exports and imports have about tripled as a share of gross domestic product gdp with their sum now about 30 percent of gdp still relatively small by international standards but certainly notable financial linkages have grown enormously as well the united states has had open capital markets for a long time but the sum of u s external assets and liabilities has grown from about 25 percent of gdp in 1960 to more than 300 percent today and reflecting the greater integration of global financial markets the correlation of u s and foreign equity and bond markets has trended broadly upward for several decades 3 channels of transmission of global shocks to the u s economy this increased integration i have described has heightened the exposure of the u s economy to external shocks but what are the channels of transmission of these shocks to the united states for concreteness let us consider the case of a negative demand shock originating abroad such as a foreign recession first this shock affects the united states through direct trade links lowering demand for u s exports and thus lowering u s gdp second the foreign recession leads to lower interest rates abroad and other things being equal raises the value of the dollar which in turn lowers u s exports and boosts u s imports the dollar appreciation also puts downward pressure on u s import prices and thereby inflation the extent to which foreign worries lead to safe haven flows may add to the dollar s strength finally there is contagion to u s financial markets let me first elaborate on the exchange rate channel i just mentioned the traditional determinants of exchange rates that is differentials in expected rates of return apply to the united states as to other countries but the u s economy is different because of the special role of u s government bonds as global safe assets as a consequence an adverse foreign shock that damped the demand for risky assets would be expected to trigger safe haven flows that boost the dollar weighing on the u s economy 4 the spillover of risk aversion to u s markets might well also push down equity prices and widen corporate credit spreads adding to the contractionary pressures however the same safe haven flows into treasury securities would cause u s long term yields to fall mitigating these adverse effects on domestic demand and activity 5 historical experience let us consider some historical examples of the effect of adverse foreign shocks on the u s economy the mexican peso crisis of 1994 and 95 and the asian financial crisis of 1997 through 98 resulted in substantial hits to aggregate emerging market economy eme growth but they had fairly muted effects on u s growth 6 in part this limited response in previous decades reflected the smaller share of the emes in the global economy and as a related matter in u s trade furthermore the weight of emes in the global financial system was lighter in previous decades so their crises were less disruptive to global markets 7 finally even back then the safe haven flows into dollar assets that i highlighted earlier were an important mitigating factor pushing down u s long term yields to be sure the russian default of august 1998 followed by the collapse of long term capital management had more substantial effects on global markets and posed greater risk to the u s economy which triggered a policy response by the fed in which the federal funds rate was cut 75 basis points between september and november of that year 8 of note after economic prospects appeared to stabilize the fed reversed those cuts in 1999 in recent times global shocks have also been consequential for u s economic prospects and monetary policy examples include the 2011 13 euro zone recession and the china devaluation and capital flight episode of 2015 and 16 when worries about a hard landing and renminbi depreciation respectively roiled world markets both of these shocks originated in economies with large footprints in the global economy and financial system and as a result they induced substantial disruptions in global financial markets during both episodes u s stock markets fell and the dollar appreciated especially during 2015 and 2016 as ever these negative shocks were associated with safe haven flows that pushed u s treasury yields down 9 despite the drop in yields overall financial conditions in the united states tightened weighing on aggregate demand 10 yet in these episodes accommodative policy responses in the united states helped ward off actual contractions of u s activity during the 2011 13 euro zone recession the united states was already pursuing very accommodative policies in the wake of the global financial crisis but the timing of the maturity extension program and the third phase of u s quantitative easing suggests they were helpful responses to the spillovers to the united states from this downturn 11 for the china episode of 2015 and 16 federal open market committee fomc statements from the time indicate that concerns about foreign developments and their effect on u s financial conditions were a factor contributing to the delay in previously anticipated policy rate increases thereby supporting the economy the message from these recent episodes is not just about the importance of timely policy adjustments by the central bank it is also about the importance of the enhanced resilience of financial institutions that has been achieved since the global financial crisis undoubtedly this resilience helped prevent adverse financial shocks from contributing to a more serious downturn recent developments let me conclude with some remarks on recent developments u s and other financial markets are attuned to a number of prominent downside global risks which include brexit a sharp slowdown in global growth prospects and trade tensions even though the fed has been and is committed to a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and price stability in today s world u s policymakers can hardly ignore these risks and three of our most recent fomc statements have highlighted concerns about global economic and financial developments in addition in our policy statements as well as in other communications we have indicated that in the presence of these risks and with inflation pressures muted we can afford to be patient and data dependent as we assess in future meetings what adjustments in our policy rate might be necessary to sustain growth employment and price stability

and not necessarily those of other federal reserve board members or federal open market committee participants i am grateful to shaghil ahmed of the federal reserve board staff for his assistance in preparing this text 2 a recent exception is ferrara and teuf 2018 who construct an international environment indicator based on a textual analysis of federal open market committee minutes and examine the connection between this indicator and u s monetary policy 3 among others kohn 2008 documents the increase in recent decades of u s trade links with the rest of the world including through internationally integrated production as well as the increased financial linkages of the united states with the rest of the world 4 other countries that are also recipients of safe haven flows include japan and switzerland 5 an additional channel i have abstracted from here is that of commodity prices which often move significantly in response to foreign factors since the united states is both a large exporter of some commodities and a large importer of some other commodities the overall implications for u s activity are likely to be mixed in particular the effects of oil prices on the u s economy have been quite extensively studied for example kilian 2008 and kilian and vigfusson 2017 present evidence on how increases in oil prices have historically adversely affected u s economic performance as the united states is a net importer of oil more recently as outlined in board of governors 2018 pp 16 17 with the net oil import share trending lower in the united states the drag on u s gdp from higher oil prices has likely declined 6 most studies discussing contagion effects of the mexican peso crisis focus on effects on other latin american countries and do not highlight effects on u s growth studies on the effects of the asian financial crisis on u s activity generally find from modest adverse to even slightly positive effects see for example duca gould and taylor 1998 harrigan 2000 and van wincoop and yi 2000 duca gould and taylor 1998 called the effect on the united states more of a swell rather than a tsunami p 1 one study pollard and coughlin 1999 found significant negative effects of the asian crisis on u s exports in certain industries but it also concluded that this effect did not translate into much of an effect on industry outputs 7 support provided by the official international financial community also helped mute global market disruptions during these eme crises 8 dell ariccia zettelmeyer and schnabel 2002 argue that the more substantial response of global financial markets to the russian default was because investors were expecting russia to be rescued from having to default by the international monetary fund and there was a global retreat from risk when that did not happen 9 media commentary from 2015 and 2016 is replete with descriptions of the rout in global financial markets resulting from financial turbulence in china see for example economist 2015 10 in may 2012 i gave an interview at the council on foreign relations highlighting the potential risks to the fragile u s economic recovery posed by the euro zone sovereign debt crisis see clarida 2012 11 the quantitative easing was important because the united states had already reduced the policy rate to zero and as argued for example in bodenstein erceg and guerrieri 2009 the spillover effects of adverse foreign demand shocks to the u s economy are significantly amplified at the zero lower bound for the policy rate in the absence of other expansionary policies
george tawlon manneh oppong ousman weah president of liberia an appendage to the country s deepening economic crisis has shown itself in the decision by firestone liberia to lay off 800workers 13percent of its workforce in the early quarter of 2019 according to the multinational which has been in liberia and has had private property right to 10percent of the country s arable land since 1926 its decision to lay off the workers is as the result of a thorough and strategic review of its current operations coupled with unsustainable losses resulting from high overhead costs associated with the company s concession agreement with the government of liberia low natural rubber production because of the country s prolonged civil wars and continued low global natural rubber prices there are many reasons firestone will have its way in assaulting the workers without any resistance thus taking bread from the table of approximately 4000thousand liberians if the number of each worker s dependents is placed at five firstly national government is the political arm of international finance capital e g firestone liberia the micro nationalists occupying positions in the three branches of government are errand boys and girls in the service of multinationals like firestone that have private ownership of the commanding heights of the country s economy the government enact anti labor laws to make workers slavish in favor of foreign capital concession agreements are signed at the peril of the people and in the interest of capital the multinationals firestone of no exception are lavished with tax holidays import and export duties exemptions free access to repatriate surplus value and dividends etc under the veil of investment incentives the state unleashes its armed bodies of men to crush workers resistance against bad labor practices illegal dismissal wage slavery etc as a way of protecting the profit interest of capital at the expense of the working masses these features of a neo colonial capitalist economy in addition to the corruption incompetence and ineptitude of the george weah led government provide firestone liberia more leverages to stifle workers whose labor is the source of the wealth produce at the plantation but never have any right to decide how such wealth is appropriated for more than a century firestone liberia has exploited liberia s labour and land with little benefit to the country and people access to decent housing and other social services for workers remain a challenge this age old concession company cannot boast of a university for the workers children vast majority of the surplus exploited from the labor of liberian workers is repatriated instead of being reinvested in the industrial sector of the economy turning rubber into finished goods thus expanding the productivity of labor although industrial employment which was dominant in the global north through the 1970s has now shifted to the global south in the 21st century liberia since its integration into the global capitalist system continues to stagnate in the unequal international division of labour as a supplier of latex rubber to developed economies at a cheap price and an importer of manufactured rubber made goods from those economies at a high price it is estimated that from every dollar made from the production of rubber 0 83cents is repatriated through salaries of expatriates as well as profits and dividends while and 0 17cents covers wages to liberian workers and taxes and royalties to the liberian government this pattern is not only unique to firestone it is also the staple of other multinationals that have ownership of other commanding heights of the liberian economy while millions are being exported from the production of rubber iron ore gold diamond timber and other cash crops the paltry sum given as wages cannot meet workers demand for goods and services government revenue generated through this mean is only enough to run a useless state bureaucracy where parasites make lucrative salaries and emoluments while education health infrastructure etc lie in ruins and tatters the piecemeal development in these sectors is funded through loans from mostly the world bank and imf that the country is unable to repay thus constraining with debt burden at the service of the bretton woods institutions this then leads the country to be placed in an economic straitjacket with structural adjustment programmes being foisted on it by the two international economic police groups this in part is the principal reason for the underdevelopment of the republic and has been the channel carved and maintained by imperial external forces that needed the resources of an underdeveloped liberia to keep their manufacturing industries afloat another issue this asymmetrical relations brings to the fore is that the whole structure of neocolonial capitalism is intended to stagnate countries of the global south but develop the ones in the global north however there has been no epoch in our country s history that such condition has been rejected and reverse as was done in few african asian and latin american countries after the colonial powers were crushed into withdrawing their flags and armed bodies of men the media and the ministry of information reported that a government delegation headed by the minister of state and presidential affairs nathaniel mcgill a reprobate who connived with the central bank governor and the venal rascal finance minister samuel tweah to plunder us 25million meant to mop up excess liquidity has initiated series of meetings with the management of firestone to plead with the company to rescind its decision to layoff the workers as has always been the regime which is an obedient poodle of neocolonial capitalism has gone genuflecting before firestone to have mercy on the workers instead of informing firestone that since its entry into the homeland it has exploited super surplus value from the workers and accumulated massive profits to the disadvantage of the workers so it is high time it treat the liberian workers with dignity and honor on the contrary the regime will do no such thing as it lacks the spine to put up any nationalistic defense for the working masses what we anticipate is the conclusion of more concessions that favor firestone s quest to maximize profits add to the unemployment quagmire and give the remaining workers pittance by cut in wages this is the fate of a neo colonial territory that is economically dominated by international finance capital and politically controlled by a clique of conservative politicos that plunder the public treasury while the exploited layers of society enslaved workers poor peasants and urban pauperized masses rot in infinite poverty and economic deprivation the workers conscious united and resilient are the only force that can struggle against the decision of firestone liberia as even the regime is complicit in the scheme consistent strike shut down of production etc can win over so many concessions from firestone including the reversion of the company s decision to lay off workers improvement in housing wage increase etc but unfortunately the worker union is in comatose and only implement diktats from firestone to the disadvantage of its constituent members in short the power of capital has compromised the leadership of the workers union at the plantation thus the workers are vulnerable to the assault of capital and weak to confront exploitation head on a neutralized and sold out workers leadership at firestone and other multinationals like sime darby gvl arcelor mittal mng gold mine bea mountain etc a dormant liberia labor congress and an enclave working class which has just less than 5percent of the economically active population due to the low productivity of labor in the liberian economy all deprive the country of militant working class actions against exploitation the firestone lay off decision is not only a reflection of how this corporation is a symbol of neo colonial exploitation in liberia since 1926 it is also the effect of the prevailing global capitalist crisis the major capitalist economies suffer from the menace of overproduction overcapacity which arises as a result of fall in aggregate demand for goods and services due to global stagnant wages and rising cost of living this fall in demand comes about when workers cannot afford to buy with their wages the commodities they produce with their labor power and a kind of social alienation engendered by consistent cuts in real wages which is a necessity to increase the rate of profits of the few fat cats that have centralized capital in their hands thus many goods especially in the steel and automobile industries are going unsold and firms are no longer expanding production but rather jockeying for markets to dump their surplus goods besides we are in the stage of monopoly capitalism where speculation rather than investment in production is the major source of wealth accumulation elements with big capital instead of expanding production through investment rather stash their money in banks or gamble on the stock exchange a kind of scenario where money is used to produce money according to the world bank gdp growth in china fell from 6 8percent in first half of 2018 to 6 5percent in the last quarter of 2018 due to low investment and export growth in the euro area declined from 2 4percent in 2017 to 2 1percent in 2018 and is expected to moderate to 1 9percent in 2019 and 1 7percent in 2020 according to the european union commission on march 21 2019 the federal open market committee announced at its meeting that the us economy will slow to 2 1percent in 2019 from 3percent in 2018 and is expected to further decline to 1 9percent in 2020 these number indicate that the era of boom and bust is over and that capitalism has exhausted its capacity to develop the productive forces and that the system can no more play the progressive role it played in the past especially the immediate post war era liberia s division of labor producer of raw materials is tied to the centers of capitalism economic decline in those centers will obviously send shockwave in the liberian economy decline in steel production in china eu member states usa etc affects iron ore production in liberia iron ore production produces the highest percentage of liberia s gdp fall in rubber related manufacturing in the centers of capitalism unarguably affects the production of rubber in liberia rubber production produces the second highest percent of the country s gdp once there is fall in demand for rubber and iron ore multinationals total income will decline and eventually elect to lay off workers to fill in for the decline in their rate of profit this is why firestone is laying off 13percent of its work force other multinationals like sime darby mng and bea mountain are laying off significant numbers of their total work force we must also expect china union and arcelor mittal to announce its own plan to cut its work force the liberian economy is at the edge of the cliff and the consequences are catastrophe the regime is clueless as macroeconomic stability proved elusive according to an imf s assessment team according to the team growth forecast for 2018 which was estimated at 2 5percent is now 1 2percent the team also reported a decline in the 2019 forecast from 4 7percent to 0 4percent the liberian dollars depreciated by 26percent in 2018 and inflation accelerated to 28percent at the end of december this is butchering the income of thousands of liberians who are either being subjected to wage slavery at the mines and plantations or are eking out a living through informal economic activities the incompetent corrupt and clueless regime of george weah looking at these challenges stretches brazenly in opulence but the opulence of george weah is literally scandalous weah and his henchmen s obscene overnight wealth was acquired through theft and swindling on a vast scale of the taxes and resources of a people trapped in starvation and humiliation the people are seeing these antics and are drawing the necessary conclusions the growing contradictions are fast creating a revolutionary situation when all the layers of the exploited class will be actively involved with the politics and life of society the people are becoming conscious of their power as the motor force of social progress this may not be seen on the surface now but the molecular changes are taking place under the surface and sooner than later the bubble will burst and everything will turn into its opposite the liberian workers in the mines and on the plantations inspired by the struggle of the masses in sudan and algeria against their bankrupt ruling classes and the struggle of the workers for higher minimum wage in nigeria are becoming aware that it is their labor power which is exploited to produce wealth from nature and that they are the only productive class in a capitalist arrangement but are being kept on the margins of society they will need not the permission of their sold out leaders to begin the spontaneous movement into history the peasant masses although not dispossessed of land like their counterparts in south africa are becoming conscious that they cannot move from subsistence farming to industrial agriculture because of the inert place the unequal international division of labor has created for the liberian economy the lumpen proletariat this class of predominantly former peasants that emigrated from the rural areas to the urban centers residing in shanty towns and native reserves with no market for their labor thus some resorting to crimes prostitution petite trading and other informal economic activities are rapidly realizing that their poverty is not destined by god and are frowning on the mysticism that the solution is to seek solace in salvation but rather they are drawing the conclusion that their wretched existence is the end product of exploitation by both international finance capital and its poster boys and girls in the three branches of government the teachers students doctors nurses civil servants and all professionals whose wages can no longer meet their demand for goods and services due to rising inflation through experience are developing their consciousness and will not hesitate to throw themselves into struggle against this order that offers the people social alienation while the millions are repatriated and the bureaucratic parasites delight in pomp and pageantry this is the description of the objective material condition that is fast being created in the neo colonial liberian society but this condition is not enough to usher in a social revolution that takes the people from the state of sub human status and encapsulates their hopes and aspirations and make them the drivers of their own destiny there must be a disciplined and enlightened group of men and women that understands that the programs of a social revolution that prioritize the dignity and honor of the whole mass of people cannot be implemented in the limits of the neo colonial capitalist system suffice this to mean that there is a historical necessity for a political organization with a sense of history and the sea of cadres trained to drive the revolutionary itinerary and must play the subjective role of leading the masses to final victory this is what we are committed to

boys and girls in the three branches of government the teachers students doctors nurses civil servants and all professionals whose wages can no longer meet their demand for goods and services due to rising inflation through experience are developing their consciousness and will not hesitate to throw themselves into struggle against this order that offers the people social alienation while the millions are repatriated and the bureaucratic parasites delight in pomp and pageantry this is the description of the objective material condition that is fast being created in the neo colonial liberian society but this condition is not enough to usher in a social revolution that takes the people from the state of sub human status and encapsulates their hopes and aspirations and make them the drivers of their own destiny there must be a disciplined and enlightened group of men and women that understands that the programs of a social revolution that prioritize the dignity and honor of the whole mass of people cannot be implemented in the limits of the neo colonial capitalist system suffice this to mean that there is a historical necessity for a political organization with a sense of history and the sea of cadres trained to drive the revolutionary itinerary and must play the subjective role of leading the masses to final victory this is what we are committed to
the 2019 edition of the annual heritage foundation index of economic freedomrefshows moderate slippage in the economic freedom rankings of some eurozone economies this is a concern especially as this trend coincides with the peak of the largest monetary stimulus in european union history the goal of which was to provide eu economies with opportunities to modernize and to implement important structural reforms aimed at delivering more robust growth more sustainable job creation and the generation of higher quality jobs in the midst of this decline in europe spain s 2019 economic freedom score has demonstrated encouraging improvement it rose from 65 1 in 2018 to 65 7 of a maximum 100 in 2019 ref making the spanish economy the 57th freest in the 2019 index aided by a significant increase in fiscal health after tax cuts in 2015 and 2016 helped to boost the economy while preserving budgetary stability while spain is ranked 28th among 44 countries in the index s entire european region only seven of the 28 member countries of the european union scored lower than spain in the 2019 index slovenia portugal hungary slovakia france italy and croatia spain s overall score is below the regional european average of 68 6 but it is above the world average of 60 8 this backgrounder examines how the next government in spain can return the country to an upward trajectory in the years to come and propel spain to the top economic freedom rankings in europe a role model for europe under the government of former prime minister mariano rajoy which was in power from 2011 to 2018 spain became something of a role model for how a country can implement significant and vitally necessary structural reforms during a financial crisis its labor market reform was a key factor in stopping the massive increase in unemployment and other crucial reforms also played an important part in the country s rebound spain s subsequent recovery from its worst economic crisis in decades was impressive especially because relatively few international observers expected the country to deliver consistent above trend growth and rapid job creation between 2012 and 2017 spain recovered more than half of the jobs lost during a crisis that was initially 1 denied by the previous socialist administration of josé luis zapatero in office from 2004 to 2011 and 2 then exacerbated by zapatero s misguided policies deficit spending and mounting structural imbalances since then spain has slashed its fiscal deficit by 70 percent and brought what had been a dangerously high trade deficit nearly into balance the fact that exports have risen to 33 percent of gross domestic product gdp is also relevant as spain s largest trading partners have remained stagnant or in recession during the same period external factors have helped of course support from the european central bank ecb low interest rates and cheap oil prices support the economy but those factors should have also helped other eu economies such as italy which are similarly vulnerable to volatile energy prices and interest rates nevertheless it has been spain that has created more than 1 5 million jobs in the past three years the second highest country in the eu in terms of full time job creation the main reason for the difference in performance of spain relative to neighboring eu countries has been the achievement of a very ambitious set of structural reforms a financial reform that helped change the perception of risk in the spanish financial system a labor market reform that turned around a seemingly unstoppable trend of rising unemployment and recovered jobs and salaries a moderation in government spending without reducing social expenditures and a fiscal reform in 2015 that reduced corporate and income taxes public debt although elevated has been contained relative to gdp in the past three years these have been the deciding factors that have driven a recovery under which inflation was non existent and global trade growth was slowing down these structural reforms were achieved at a high political cost however as has been the case in numerous other eu countries where tough decisions had to be made to achieve greater economic freedom in the long run such as in ireland in the case of spain the rajoy government paid that political price when it was unable to secure an absolute majority in the elections in 2015 and 2016 and ultimately was forced from power in 2018 a weak minority socialist government under prime minister pedro sánchez replaced it and proceeded to unleash a variety of damaging internal forces that together with some negative external developments could put the spanish recovery in jeopardy and weaken the economy again for example forbes reports that at the end of 2018 the sanchez government approved the largest increase in the minimum wage since 1977 raising the minimum wage to 900 1 030 per month representing an increase of 22 percent ref policy backsliding triggered by the implementation of these sorts of socialist policies is the main reason why a significant improvement in economic freedom is necessary if this higher minimum wage is permitted to continue under a new government the negative effects will include a spike in inflation and many companies avoiding the hiring of more expensive permanent workers in fact in the months since the minimum wage increased the number of unemployed workers in spain has risen january and february of 2019 have been the worst equivalent months for employment in spain since 2013 ref a complicated political landscape in 2018 still under the rajoy government spain saw tax receipts rise more than nominal gdp and achieved record revenues after much needed tax cuts corporate tax receipts rose 29 percent after the nominal corporate tax rate was cut to 25 percent unfortunately the socialist sanchez government has been dependent on the votes of radical left and nationalist parties whose policy priorities are generally to increase spending raise taxes and run budget deficits these historically bad policies alone will make pushing for more economic freedom in spain a bigger challenge if another left of center coalition manages to win the april 28 2019 election and form a new government spain has had deficits every year since 1980 except during the years of the real estate bubble 2005 through 2007 that preceded the crisis relying on tax increases and revenue measures has historically been a bad choice however because when spendthrift governments whose leaders are seeking to buy votes are in power government spending consistently rises above those revenues and revenue estimates tend to be optimistic as the ecb has pointed out in its paper on fiscal forecasting lessons from the literature and challenges ref calls by prime minister sanchez s government to re introduce previous rigidities and eliminate the rajoy government s 2012 labor market reform will also not solve spain s structural problems spain has had an average of 17 percent unemployment since 1980 with three different periods where it rose above 20 percent temporary jobs were already more than 25 percent of all contracts before the crisis going back to the mistakes of the past will not solve a long term problem that has more to do with low productivity and the inefficiency of many small and medium sized enterprises smes promising greater workers rights will do more harm than good in that context solving spain s unemployment problem can only be achieved by creating an economic climate conducive to the creation of many more private companies attracting more investment and allowing micro enterprises to grow into smes and smes to grow into large firms this goal can be achieved by removing perverse government imposed incentives for firms to remain small and non competitive such as through punitive tax and labor code provisions that increase interventionist government measures once a firm reaches an arbitrary threshold of more than one million euros in revenue or more than 10 full time employees there are also external forces looming on the policy horizon that could threaten growth and job creation the international monetary fund is requesting that spain raise some value added tax vat rates tranches which could hinder nascent growth of consumption additionally brussels seems adamant on pressuring spain into adopting anti growth measures by returning to the old mistake of raising taxes this pro higher tax policy of the eu reflects the desperation of brussels bureaucrats as they ponder how to confront the massive future unfunded spending liabilities resulting from decades of over promising generous welfare state benefits to european voters brussels is also pushing the organization for economic cooperation and development s oecd s anti tax base erosion project with the aim of increasing tax collections ref policymakers in spain cannot and should not ignore the global trend to decrease not increase corporate taxes it is well established that reducing the tax wedge has a direct positive impact on investment job creation and attraction of capital ref likewise spanish policymakers cannot ignore that the positive effects of labor market reform have been recognized even by france notorious for decades of labor code inflexibility which is currently planning labor code reforms similar to spain s in order to boost job creation the bottom line that the next spanish government must face is that the imbalances of the spanish economy an elevated public debt a large deficit and still high unemployment will not be solved by looking to the past but by improving economic freedom the imbalances can be solved through supply side reforms attracting foreign investment allowing companies and families to keep more of their money and improving public sector efficiency while retaining a strong but sustainable social component in this way spain can grow faster than the rest of the european union in 2019 and beyond and faster than the forecast 2 5 percent in 2019 as it has done in the past two years spain has proven that it can create more than 500 000 jobs a year to do so however the next government will have to overcome the vast array of powerful forces mentioned above that would put the brakes on additional job creation perhaps as a start it would be instructive for socialists in spain to study the recent success enjoyed by so called progressives in new york city whose unrelenting anti business demands effectively killed the creation of 25 000 new high paying jobs in that city by amazon assuming that saner heads prevail and a pro free market government takes power how can it position spain within the eurozone so that the country s economic freedom score improves from its current acceptable level and the country makes the leap into the ranks of continental and even global leadership recipe for success a careful analysis of the spanish economy reveals the minor but important adjustments that can be made to increase the attractiveness of the economy prudent fiscal policy and spending cuts spain is a country of smes ninety percent of spanish companies fall into this category however these spanish companies tend to be smaller than those of peer countries furthermore the vast majority of smes almost 87 percent are micro companies fewer than nine employees annual sales of less than two million euros this corporate structure means that the spanish economy is very vulnerable to economic cycles and it means that unemployment can rise much faster than in other countries because more than 80 percent of jobs are created by smes better tax policy could reduce this vulnerability the spanish tax wedge on companies is too highref and ranks among the nine most onerous tax regimes for businesses in europe this substantial tax wedge is a very significant obstacle to growth and prevents many companies from transitioning from an sme to a larger size the spanish tax system adds to their burden since it is oriented toward trying to increase revenues at any cost even if that makes companies weaker and more cyclically dependent taxes on labor are particularly high as well an average salaried worker in spain pays almost 40 percent in taxes social contributions are among the highest in the oecd and this works as a deterrent to job creation as the cost for employers is almost twice what the worker receives as net salary as a result many employers and employees have been driven into the country s large informal economy in addition to the heavy tax burden spain retains an obsolete system of subsidies and deductions that could be reduced in order to make the tax system simpler and clearer a simple lower and attractive tax system can be implemented and it would help to boost receipts as economic activity rises and companies become more robust and grow in size government public spending in spain could be significantly more efficient by eliminating the duplication and parallel administrations created by some regional communities the savings from these cuts could be used to implement a large and innovative tax cut to boost productivity and growth additional labor market reforms through administrative reorganization in addition to the reforms advocated above that are essential to reduce unemployment further reforms and re organization are necessary in the bureaucracies that administer spanish labor laws in order to reduce the costs to employers of hiring and employing spanish workers the spanish economy is held hostage by a tangled web of separate regional local and national labor regulations that make it very difficult for companies to manage such a complicated system when trading or conducting business between regions an effort to normalize rules and regulations as well as a high priority campaign to cut this red tape would benefit the economy enormously the spanish legal and regulatory system is needlessly complex too it aims to contemplate all possible scenarios and tries to provide guarantees for any eventuality however it ultimately fails to deliver the job security it promises and instead acts as a burden on growth and economic development the next government should make the cutting of red tape and regulations job number one in order to boost competitiveness and attractiveness of the economy conclusion spain can lead economic freedom in the eurozone by implementing the policies outlined in this backgrounder the next government should also study similar pro market and pro growth reforms and policies undertaken by ireland which have helped that country grow faster and attract more investment than other economic freedom leaders in the european union such as the u k the netherlands denmark and estonia thanks to the reforms implemented by successive irish governments over the years ireland is now one of only six countries in the world and the only eu country that ranks as free in the 2019 index of economic freedom it is time to avoid the temptation of relying on low interest rates and falling into the trap of increasing imbalances which has been spain s historical mistake every time that conditions start to improve spanish governments seem to backslide into a destructive pattern of excessive spending more debt and rigidity the foundation for a more sustainable growth and higher job creation has been set as was the case in 2012 however the next government of spain must be adamant about sticking to a reformist agenda and avoiding past errors it will be challenging and difficult for all parties to agree certainly but they must not forget history raising taxes and spending never adds spice to a recipe for success it ruins the dish james m roberts is research fellow for economic freedom and growth in the center for international trade and economics of the kathryn and shelby cullom davis institute for

the perspective atlanta georgia march 28 2019 an appendage to the country s deepening economic crisis has shown itself in the decision by firestone liberia to lay off 800workers 13percent of its workforce in the early quarter of 2019 according to the multinational which has been in liberia and has had private property right to 10percent of the country s arable land since 1926 its decision to lay off the workers is as the result of a thorough and strategic review of its current operations coupled with unsustainable losses resulting from high overhead costs associated with the company s concession agreement with the government of liberia low natural rubber production because of the country s prolonged civil wars and continued low global natural rubber prices there are many reasons firestone will have its way in assaulting the workers without any resistance thus taking bread from the table of approximately 4000thousand liberians if the number of each worker s dependents is placed at five firstly national government is the political arm of international finance capital e g firestone liberia the micro nationalists occupying positions in the three branches of government are errand boys and girls in the service of multinationals like firestone that have private ownership of the commanding heights of the country s economy the government enact anti labor laws to make workers slavish in favor of foreign capital concession agreements are signed at the peril of the people and in the interest of capital the multinationals firestone of no exception are lavished with tax holidays import and export duties exemptions free access to repatriate surplus value and dividends etc under the veil of investment incentives the state unleashes its armed bodies of men to crush workers resistance against bad labor practices illegal dismissal wage slavery etc as a way of protecting the profit interest of capital at the expense of the working masses these features of a neo colonial capitalist economy in addition to the corruption incompetence and ineptitude of the george weah led government provide firestone liberia more leverages to stifle workers whose labor is the source of the wealth produce at the plantation but never have any right to decide how such wealth is appropriated for more than a century firestone liberia has exploited liberia s labor and land with little benefit to the country and people access to decent housing and other social services for workers remain a challenge this age old concession company cannot boast of a university for the workers children vast majority of the surplus exploited from the labor of liberian workers is repatriated instead of being reinvested in the industrial sector of the economy turning rubber into finished goods thus expanding the productivity of labor although industrial employment which was dominant in the global north through the 1970s has now shifted to the global south in the 21st century liberia since its integration into the global capitalist system continues to stagnate in the unequal international division of labor as a supplier of latex rubber to developed economies at a cheap price and an importer of manufactured rubber made goods from those economies at a high price it is estimated that from every dollar made from the production of rubber 0 83cents is repatriated through salaries of expatriates as well as profits and dividends while and 0 17cents covers wages to liberian workers and taxes and royalties to the liberian government this pattern is not only unique to firestone it is also the staple of other multinationals that have ownership of other commanding heights of the liberian economy while millions are being exported from the production of rubber iron ore gold diamond timber and other cash crops the paltry sum given as wages cannot meet workers demand for goods and services government revenue generated through this mean is only enough to run a useless state bureaucracy where parasites make lucrative salaries and emoluments while education health infrastructure etc lie in ruins and tatters the piecemeal development in these sectors is funded through loans from mostly the world bank and imf that the country is unable to repay thus constraining with debt burden at the service of the bretton woods institutions this then lead the country to be placed in an economic straitjacket with structural adjustment programmes being foisted on it by the two international economic police groups this in part is the principal reason for the underdevelopment of the republic and has been the channel carved and maintained by imperial external forces that needed the resources of an underdeveloped liberia to keep their manufacturing industries afloat another issue this asymmetrical relations brings to the fore is that the whole structure of neocolonial capitalism is intended to stagnate countries of the global south but develop the ones in the global north however there has been no epoch in our country s history that such condition has been rejected and reverse as was done in few african asian and latin american countries after the colonial powers were crushed into withdrawing their flags and armed bodies of men the media and the ministry of information reported that a government delegation headed by the minister of state and presidential affairs nathaniel mcgill a reprobate who connived with the central bank governor and the venal rascal finance minister samuel tweah to plunder us 25million meant to mop up excess liquidity has initiated series of meetings with the management of firestone to plead with the company to rescind its decision to lay off the workers as has always been the regime which is an obedient poodle of neocolonial capitalism has gone genuflecting before firestone to have mercy on the workers instead of informing firestone that since its entry into the homeland it has exploited super surplus value from the workers and accumulated massive profits to the disadvantage of the workers so it is high time it treat the liberian workers with dignity and honor on the contrary the regime will do no such thing as it lacks the spine to put up any nationalistic defense for the working masses what we anticipate is the conclusion of more concessions that favor firestone s quest to maximize profits add to the unemployment quagmire and give the remaining workers pittance by cut in wages this is the fate of a neo colonial territory that is economically dominated by international finance capital and politically controlled by a clique of conservative politicos that plunder the public treasury while the exploited layers of society enslaved workers poor peasants and urban pauperized masses rot in infinite poverty and economic deprivation the workers conscious united and resilient are the only force that can struggle against the decision of firestone liberia as even the regime is complicit in the scheme consistent strike shut down of production etc can win over so many concessions from firestone including the reversion of the company s decision to lay off workers improvement in housing wage increase etc but unfortunately the worker union is in comatose and only implement diktats from firestone to the disadvantage of its constituent members in short the power of capital has compromised the leadership of the workers union at the plantation thus the workers are vulnerable to the assault of capital and weak to confront exploitation head on a neutralized and sold out workers leadership at firestone and other multinationals like sime darby gvl arcelor mittal mng gold mine bea mountain etc a dormant liberia labor congress and an enclave working class which has just less than 5percent of the economically active population due to the low productivity of labor in the liberian economy all deprive the country of militant working class actions against exploitation the firestone lay off decision is not only a reflection of how this corporation is a symbol of neo colonial exploitation in liberia since 1926 it is also the effect of the prevailing global capitalist crisis the major capitalist economies suffer from the menace of overproduction overcapacity which arises as a result of fall in aggregate demand for goods and services due to global stagnant wages and rising cost of living this fall in demand comes about when workers cannot afford to buy with their wages the commodities they produce with their labor power and a kind of social alienation engendered by consistent cuts in real wages which is a necessity to increase the rate of profits of the few fat cats that have centralized capital in their hands thus many goods especially in the steel and automobile industries are going unsold and firms are no longer expanding production but rather jockeying for markets to dump their surplus goods besides we are in the stage of monopoly capitalism where speculation rather than investment in production is the major source of wealth accumulation elements with big capital instead of expanding production through investment rather stash their money in banks or gamble on the stock exchange a kind of scenario where money is used to produce money according to the world bank gdp growth in china fell from 6 8percent in first half of 2018 to 6 5percent in the last quarter of 2018 due to low investment and export growth in the euro area declined from 2 4percent in 2017 to 2 1percent in 2018 and is expected to moderate to 1 9percent in 2019 and 1 7percent in 2020 according to the european union commission on march 21 2019 the federal open market committee announced at its meeting that the us economy will slow to 2 1percent in 2019 from 3percent in 2018 and is expected to further decline to 1 9percent in 2020 these number indicate that the era of boom and bust is over and that capitalism has exhausted its capacity to develop the productive forces and that the system can no more play the progressive role it played in the past especially the immediate post war era liberia s division of labor producer of raw materials is tied to the centers of capitalism economic decline in those centers will obviously send shockwave in the liberian economy decline in steel production in china eu member states usa etc affects iron ore production in liberia iron ore production produces the highest percentage of liberia s gdp fall in rubber related manufacturing in the centers of capitalism unarguably affects the production of rubber in liberia rubber production produces the second highest percentage of the country s gdp once there is fall in demand for rubber and iron ore multinationals total income will decline and eventually elect to lay off workers to fill in for the decline in their rate of profit this is why firestone is laying off 13percent of its workforce other multinationals like sime darby mng and bea mountain are laying off significant numbers of their total workforce we must also expect china union and arcelor mittal to announce its own plan to cut its workforce the liberian economy is at the edge of the cliff and the consequences are catastrophe the regime is clueless as macroeconomic stability proved elusive according to an imf s assessment team according to the team growth forecast for 2018 which was estimated at 2 5percent is now 1 2percent the team also reported a decline in the 2019 forecast from 4 7percent to 0 4percent the liberian dollars depreciated by 26percent in 2018 and inflation accelerated to 28percent at the end of december this is butchering the income of thousands of liberians who are either being subjected to wage slavery at the mines and plantations or are eking out a living through informal economic activities the incompetent corrupt and clueless regime of george weah looking at these challenges stretches brazenly in opulence but the opulence of george weah is literally scandalous weah and his henchmen s obscene overnight wealth was acquired through theft and swindling on a vast scale of the taxes and resources of a people trapped in starvation and humiliation the people are seeing these antics and are drawing the necessary conclusions the growing contradictions are fast creating a revolutionary situation when all the layers of the exploited class will be actively involved with the politics and life of society the people are becoming conscious of their power as the motor force of social progress this may not be seen on the surface now but the molecular changes are taking place under the surface and sooner than later the bubble will burst and everything will turn into its opposite the liberian workers in the mines and on the plantations inspired by the struggle of the masses in sudan and algeria against their bankrupt ruling classes and the struggle of the workers for higher minimum wage in nigeria are becoming aware that it is their labor power which is exploited to produce wealth from nature and that they are the only productive class in a capitalist arrangement but are being kept on the margins of society they will need not the permission of their sold out leaders to begin the spontaneous movement into history the peasant masses although not dispossessed of land like their counterparts in south africa are becoming conscious that they cannot move from subsistence farming to industrial agriculture because of the inert place the unequal international division of labor has created for the liberian economy the lumpen proletariat this class of predominantly former peasants that emigrated from the rural areas to the urban centers residing in shanty towns and native reserves with no market for their labor thus some resorting to crimes prostitution petite trading and other informal economic activities are rapidly realizing that their poverty is not destined by god and are frowning on the mysticism that the solution is to seek solace in salvation but rather they are drawing the conclusion that their wretched existence is the end product of exploitation by both international finance capital and its poster boys and girls in the three branches of government the teachers students doctors nurses civil servants and all professionals whose wages can no longer meet their demand for goods and services due to rising inflation through experience are developing their consciousness and will not hesitate to throw themselves into struggle against this order that offers the people social alienation while the millions are repatriated and the bureaucratic parasites delight in pomp and pageantry this is the description of the objective material condition that is fast being created in the neo colonial liberian society but this condition is not enough to usher in a social revolution that takes the people from the state of sub human status and encapsulates their hopes and aspirations and make them the drivers of their own destiny there must be a disciplined and enlightened group of men and women that understands that the programs of a social revolution that prioritize the dignity and honor of the whole mass of people cannot be implemented in the limits of the neo colonial capitalist system suffice this to mean that there is a historical necessity for a political organization with a sense of history and the sea of cadres trained to drive the revolutionary itinerary and must play the subjective role of leading the masses to final victory this is what we are committed to about the author

your board has explored ways of reducing this discount but no satisfactory solution has been found the position is however kept under continual review outlook the combination of share price falls in late 2018 despite rising global corporate earnings left equities trading in early 2019 on lower earnings multiples and higher dividend yields than a year previously global economic growth has however slowed and is likely to slow further during 2019 and this may put corporate profitability under pressure such developments may dictate caution in making further commitments to global equity markets buying opportunities may however emerge over the coming months in selected markets a successful resolution of the brexit crisis may make uk equities which trade on below average valuation multiples and above average yields appear more attractive particularly small and medium sized companies which tend to be more sensitive to domestic uk political and economic developments a positive outcome to the sino us trade talks may also improve the prospects for equities in some emerging markets your company ended the period positioned cautiously with respect to bond investments because of the likelihood of rising inflation instead diversification away from equities is being maintained through your company s holdings in dollar denominated cash lower risk multi asset funds and gold equities

sterling terms over the six months to 31st december 2018 the 10 57 fall in sterling terms during the final quarter of 2018 more than erased the rise in the third quarter investors risk aversion rose as the federal reserve responded to low unemployment and strong us economic growth by raising the fed funds target rate by a quarter percentage point in september and a further quarter point in december taking its range to 2 25 2 50 interest rate rises are however not the only means by which the fed has tightened monetary policy the process of shrinking the fed s swollen balance sheet is also underway with the proceeds of maturing bonds no longer wholly reinvested in further purchases allowing the fed s bond holdings to reduce steadily this is monetary tightening by another means in october the fed chairman jerome powell said us interest rates had a long way to go to reach their neutral rate stoking fears that the pace of monetary tightening would choke off growth following sharp share price falls powell revised his guidance in late november saying interest rates were close to neutral in early 2019 the fed adopted a patient or more dovish approach to monetary policy us gross domestic product growth slowed from an annualised 3 4 in the third quarter of 2018 to 2 6 in the fourth quarter as the impact of president trump s fiscal stimulus faded and growth is expected to slow further in 2019 in january 2019 us headline inflation fell to 1 6 as oil prices fell but core inflation excluding energy and food prices held steady at 2 2 the fed s progress towards monetary normalisation resulted in a positive real interest rate in contrast to the negative real interest rates that typically prevailed in the aftermath of the 2008 09 credit crisis growth also slowed in china and beijing policy makers took measures to stimulate activity such as cutting the reserve requirement ratio for bank lending in december sino us trade discussions adjourned without resolution although the us extended by 90 days the deadline for raising tariffs from 10 to 25 on 200 billion of imports talks continued in early 2019 failure to avert the impending tariff hike would most likely lead to weaker growth and higher inflation the economic weakness in the eurozone was more pronounced italy went into recession during the period and germany narrowly avoided the same fate as result equities in europe excluding the uk underperformed falling 8 19 in march 2019 the european central bank announced more monetary support delaying any interest rate rises until 2020 at the earliest

to investing and a typical investment in global equities in the 40 85 range fell 6 62 the msci ac world total return index fell 5 47 in sterling while the msci uk total return index fell 10 04 your

helped to mitigate the impact of equity market falls embark the largest private equity investment continued on its growth path and increased its market share following two fundraisings in the final quarter of 2018 the valuation increased although it is held at a discount to the prices at which new shares were issued the bias towards income funds and the interest income from dollar deposits will enhance your company s ability to pay distributions because the majority of this income will be paid out as dividends outlook global corporate earnings rose during 2018 and this when combined with share price falls left stocks trading on lower earnings multiples at the start of 2019 global economic growth is likely to slow in 2019 however putting earnings under pressure the fall in valuations may not have fully reflected the deterioration in economic prospects and your company has not increased its allocation to equities in the wake of the falls at the end of the period a successful outcome to the sino us trade negotiations and an end to the brexit impasse may however provide buying opportunities for equities particularly in the uk and emerging markets your company has minimal direct investment in bond funds diversification is achieved through investments in dollar cash gold equities and lower risk multi asset funds investments in a small number of unquoted companies may provide an additional and uncorrelated source of potential returns brompton asset management llp 28th march 2019 directors report performance in the six months to 31st december 2018 the total return

months to 31st december 2018 principal risks and uncertainties the principal risks identified by the board and the steps the board takes to mitigate them are as follows investment strategy inappropriate long term strategy poor asset allocation and manager selection could lead to underperformance the board discusses investment performance at each of its meetings and the directors receive reports detailing asset allocation investment selection and performance business conditions and general economy the company s future performance is heavily dependent on the performance of different equity and currency markets the board cannot mitigate the risks arising from adverse market movements however diversification within the portfolio will reduce the impact further information is given in portfolio risks below portfolio risks market price foreign currency and interest rate risks the twenty largest investments are listed below investment returns will be influenced by interest rates inflation investor sentiment availability cost of credit and general economic conditions in the uk and globally a proportion of the portfolio is in investments denominated in foreign currencies and movements in exchange rates could significantly affect their sterling value the investment manager takes all these factors into account when making investment decisions but the company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements the board s policy is to hold a spread of investments in order to reduce the impact of the risks arising from the above factors by investing in a spread of asset classes and geographic regions net asset value discount the discount in the price at which the company s shares trade to net asset value means that shareholders cannot realise the real underlying value of their investment for a number of years the company s share price has been at a significant discount to the company s net asset value the directors review regularly the level of discount however given the investor base of the company the board is very restricted in its ability to control the discount to net asset value investment manager the quality of the team employed by the investment manager is an important factor in delivering good performance and the loss of key staff could adversely affect returns a representative of the investment manager attends each board meeting and the board is informed if any changes to the investment team employed by the investment manager are proposed tax and regulatory risks a breach of the investment trust approved company tax regulations 2011 the regulations could lead to capital gains realised within the portfolio becoming subject to uk capital gains tax a breach of the ukla listing rules could result in suspension of the company s shares while a breach of company law could lead to criminal proceedings financial and or reputational damage the board employs brompton asset management llp as investment manager and maitland administration services limited as secretary and administrator to help manage the company s legal and regulatory obligations operational disruption to or failure of the investment manager s or administrator s accounting dealing or payment systems or the custodian s custody systems could prevent the accurate reporting and monitoring of the company s financial position the company is also exposed to the operational risk that one or more of its suppliers may not provide the required level of service the company receives regular reports from its contracted third parties investment management arrangement and related party transactions in common with most investment trusts the company does not have any executive directors or employees the day to day management and administration of the company including investment management accounting and company secretarial matters and custodian arrangements are delegated to specialist third party service providers details of related party transactions are contained in the annual report there have been no material transactions with related parties during the period which have had a significant impact on the performance of the company going concern the directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts as the assets of the company consist mainly of securities that are readily realisable or cash and it has no significant liabilities investment income exceeds annual expenditure and current liquid net assets cover current annual expenses for many years accordingly the company is of the opinion that it has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future which is considered to be in excess of five years five years is considered a reasonable time for investors when making their investment decisions in reaching this view the directors reviewed the anticipated level of annual expenditure against the cash and liquid assets within the portfolio the directors have also considered the risks the company faces auditors the half year financial report has been reviewed but not audited by ernst young llp pursuant to the

mises s insight into the importance of cantillon effects which we discussed in detail in part 2 can help illuminate not only income and wealth inequalities among individuals but also some of the reasons for the economic disparities among national economies around the globe most of the economics profession has argued for the past few decades that the 21st century will be the century of the emerging world since 2000 india and china increased their gdp by more than 10 every year and as a result it was believed that this will soon lead to convergence with the developed world rodrik 2011 nevertheless these cross country studies have mainly focused on the evolution of gdp per capita or net national income levels in this context catch up rates for brazil china india or south africa have been rather volatile between the 1960s and 1990s over the last two decades however it appeared that emerging markets had finally settled on a steady course with average catch up rates peaking at 6 to 7 before the financial crisis world bank database data 1960 2013 author s calculations however these growth rates have considerably slowed down after 2008 leveling off at around 1 according to most recent data more importantly the forces which appeared to be driving gdp growth and economic convergence were soon revealed to be artificial increases in investments unsustainable in the long run after 2008 global capital inflows retrenched rapidly and the growth in international merchandise trade which was double that of output for several years was followed by a collapse in the volumes of exports as well as of the global supply chains which had integrated most of the developing countries in the global economy the rise in commodity prices which had rapidly increased incomes in some emerging economies was soon reversed by the recession and the difficult recovery afterwards moreover most developing countries returned to heavy fiscal policies and high trade barriers after 2008 which represented a further drag on growth while it is true that cross country idiosyncrasies such as population growth technological development or government policies contributed to a significant extent to such differences this does not eliminate the important contribution of the international monetary system to such economic disparities the evolution of gdps therefore which include government spending did not capture the actual development of a country s wealth and prosperity a better indicator of underlying disparities would require some disaggregation e g the rate at which households from different countries and regions can catch up to the average level of wealth in other countries one imperfect proxy for this rate is the difference between the annual increases in wealth per adult in every region compared to the wealth growth in the wealthiest region north america because wealth growth has slowed down in the former regions between 1 and 6 and because wealth per adult in the north american region rose back to its previous crisis levels around 6 year on year change the gap between north america and the rest of the world has widened figure a and the catch up rate has dropped to negative levels over the last few years image the developing regions depicted in figure a and which are being left behind by the pace of wealth growth in rich countries constitute the periphery of the economic and financial system for example african countries have only a few traded stocks and bonds on financial markets banking systems are underdeveloped with most of the population preferring to hoard their savings while state nationalizations and heavy regulations usually keep foreign investors away as a result these nations are getting only a small part of the inflationary increases in money supplies in financial centers such as the us eu or japan through capital inflows they are also getting the new money much later because the african continent is one of the last destinations for these funds which usually go to developed and high income economies more importantly the monetary policies of these governments also reduce household wealth at a much faster past than in developed economies with no developed financial markets or banking systems monetary expansion runs its course quicker through the economy albeit with a lower incidence of malinvestments depreciating the value of the currency and making imports more expensive so while other regions of the world receive the new money sooner the periphery of the world economy has to surrender most of the wealth in a similar situation are latin american countries and india they uphold government policies which throttle foreign investments and they also receive global monetary expansion at a later time however because there are more investment opportunities in these regions and capitalists are more willing to bear the associated risks these countries are faring slightly better than states on the african continent in a much better position are the high income emerging economies in asia pacific where investment prospects and attractive policies bring in a large share of global foreign investment and sooner after the expansion of the money supply in the us for example although these inflows of capital funds bring with them a waste of capital goods though malinvestment and an unsustainable trade bubble these countries gain in the short run because they are closer to the point of monetary injections from the developed economies however the best positioned countries in the world hierarchy are the centers of international finance western european countries united states and japan with china slowly emerging as a contender to the status of financial powerhouse these countries monetary policies direct and dictate the course of global monetary inflation and credit expansion they have the best developed financial markets and banking systems and their central banks cooperate to inflate at similar rates and coordinate depreciation rates and monetary injections but their policies of inflation and reflation are also made possible by other countries which use their currencies dollar euro and yen as reserve currencies and match or even pyramid more fiat inflation to maintain a stable exchange rate this permits financial markets to continue growing mainly to the benefit of rich countries and to the detriment of already poorer countries a further comparison between household incomes in the less developed regions and net wealth levels in rich countries gives further indication of the width of the income wealth gap among nations for example in 2014 mean wealth in the united states was us 347 845 while the average household income in mexico was us 12 850 at an interest rate of 10 it would take the average mexican household approximately 270 years to catch up to the average level of wealth in the us currently however the deposit interest rate in mexico is about ten times lower around 1 and as a result it would actually take about ten times more similarly it would take an average romanian household about 360 years of savings to accumulate the average level of wealth in the united kingdom at a 10 interest rate but currently the deposit interest rate is 2 in romania which means it would actually take about 1 800 years alternatively households in africa or latin america would require between one and two centuries of savings at a 10 interest rate to catch up to the average world level of wealth approximately us 30 000 in turn it would have taken an average world household approximately 54 years in 2000 to catch up to the wealth level in north america and approximately 61 years in 2014 data from credit suisse global wealth databook 2014 author calculations as long as current monetary policies are kept in place cantillon effects will continue to redistribute wealth from peripheral economies to the ultimate centers of world finance and the ever decreasing interest rates will make it more and more difficult to bridge the income wealth gap otherwise put all possible options for these economies to enjoy a healthy growth through saving and capital accumulation import of technology and foreign direct investments are throttled by expansionary monetary policies and a host of additional government policies stifling private enterprise to be sure it is important to point out that individuals in developing countries can in fact escape poverty even with rising inequalities so it is important to put these growing inequalities in context at the same time it is also important to highlight that the levels of poverty reduction and inequality can also be due to different causes while technological development trade and globalization help reduce poverty this improvement could have counterfactually been much larger had it not been for monetary policies redistributing wealth to the detriment of the poorest strata of the society this being said there are three main tendencies going on in today s global economy whose interaction maintains and prolongs what mises called the plight of peripheral economies first and foremost monetary expansion in developed countries leads to the waste and consumption of the capital stock through malinvestment capital which could be invested in less developed countries in the longer run this also means that capital and technological development become scarcer and more expensive for developing countries making it more difficult to absorb technology at the same time capital inflows from developed countries have a bubble thy neighbor effect on these countries and chances are that part of the foreign investments peripheral economies do receive are malinvestments the changes in the pattern of trade artificial and unsustainable also affect developing countries to an even larger extent as these countries tend to rely overwhelmingly on a limited number of exported commodities second developing countries waste their own capital stock with similar inflationary policies leading to misallocation of resources and capital consumption the reduction in the national as well as global capital stock is the most important impediment to the development of these countries developing countries also adopt trade policies that promote export led growth and discourage foreign investments which further interfere with their comparative advantage they are also quick to adopt expansionary monetary policies and financialization and developing country governments are happy to engage in heavier redistributive schemes third and finally sound capital and wealth accumulation are possible only with sound money a sound international monetary system then is crucial to economic progress in general and especially to the development of peripheral economies but there is also another important element that makes these conditions above possible and that is the mentality of economic freedom and private enterprise unfortunately as mises explained in both the developed and developing world economists and statesmen are pacemakers of inflation deficit spending and confiscatory taxation mises 1990 171 as a result mises continued the problem of rendering the underdeveloped nations more prosperous cannot be solved by material aid prosperity is not simply a matter of capital investment it is an ideological issue mises 1990 173 the only lasting solution for a reconstruction of the international trade and monetary system and especially for the development of poorer countries is a radical change in social mentalities the abandonment of economic nationalism and government intervention but especially of policies of monetary expansion will be possible only if and after a transformative change in social ideology and social morale occurs what the international trade and monetary system needs in order to grow healthy are free markets sound money and entrepreneurs to maintain accumulate and employ capital for best satisfaction of consumers around the world

f p report lahore the lahore school of economics annual conference on management of the pakistan economy themed economic challenges in a changing national and global environment started wednesday the conference includes six sessions aimed to investigate key challenges pakistan s economy is facing especially on fiscal fronts more precisely the regular sessions during the conference include twenty one papers the conference opened with welcome remarks by dr shahid amjad chaudhry rector lahore school of economics dr shahid amjad chaudhry extended a warm welcome to the esteemed audience which included eminent scholars policy makers academicians students and other dignitaries earlier in his introductory remarks he stated that the key challenges faced by pakistan s economy are burgeoning fiscal and current account deficits inadequate revenue generation and sluggish economic growth to address these challenges the government needs to introduce measures to boost revenue contain the current account deficit and revive economic growth going forward together with the short run policy adjustments in the form of monetary tightening exchange rate adjustment and negotiating a bailout package with imf to restore market confidence and secure medium to long term funding for balance of payments support the government needs to introduce comprehensive reforms to promote macroeconomic stability and foster long term sustainable growth talking about the conference he briefly introduced the audience to the six sessions of the conference where a wide range of views would be shared by the participants these include macroeconomic stability public finance in pakistan balance of payments challenges agricultural sector trade policy and the prospects of cpec to name a few with his welcome remarks dr chaudhry chaired the first regular session titled macroeconomics dr rashid amjad professor of economics and director graduate institute of development studies lahore school of economics began the session with his presentation on breaking out of pakistan s stop go economic cycles does the fiscal deficit hold the key 1999 2019 the paper investigated pakistan s economic performance during 1999 2018 to identify the main growth trends and factors responsible for the overall poor growth performance in the period and to analyse the role of the fiscal deficit as the primary factor in explaining this poor economic performance the results showed that fiscal deficit has a negative impact on economic growth and is significant in both our models over the time period 2001 18 as well as 19822018 the value of the current account deficit is negative and significant during the period 20012018 but over the longer period 1982 2018 it signs changes to positive suggesting that the higher the current account deficit the higher the economic growth the overall conclusion was that economic policy makers in pakistan must ensure that the fiscal deficit is carefully managed and monitored so that steps can be taken to keep it in check before the economy reaches a point when strong stabilization measures become inevitable the second paper in the session was presented by dr moazam mahmood professor of economics at the lahore school of economics and shamyla chaudry assistant professor in economics and business administration at lahore school of economics entitled the bop crisis in pakistan stabilization versus growth this paper observed that there are large capital outflows in the country it provided an analysis which combines exchange rate management together with rate of interest as viable policy tools the authors established that depreciation alone would be of much help to manage current account deficit they proposed the controls of capital as a doable solution as it would stabilize the economy and without hindering the growth dr azam chaudhry professor and dean of economics department at lahore school of economics co authored with gul andaman presented his paper entitled balance of payments constrained growth in pakistan the paper examined if economic growth in pakistan is constrained by the balance of payments by taking into account the growth of remittances the export demand function and the import demand function the proposed model showed that the balance of payments bop constrained growth rate in pakistan is equal to 4 41 per annum the evidence further indicated that as pakistan s economic growth rate increases above this bop equilibrium growth rate of 4 41 the import bill increases significantly which in turn leads to a balance of payments crisis eventually in order to control the unsustainable current account deficit policymakers are forced to reduce aggregate demand which in turn leads to a contraction in imports until the growth rate falls back to the equilibrium growth rate the results of the model showed that instead of relying on exchange rate depreciations the long term solution for pakistan is transition towards higher value added exports the last presentation of the first session entitled a general equilibrium macroeconomic model for the pakistan economy was presented by moazam mahmood professor lahore school of economics and azam chaudhry professor at lahore school of economics co authored with aimal tanveer research associate at lahore school of economics in this presentation the authors shared a ge macro model for pakistan s economy formulated by lahore school of economics research lab as both a didactic teaching tool for students and a policy tool for advice to the gop the model which is based on a system of linear equations its conceptual economic framework is to identify a set of agents operating in key markets to determine macro aggregates for the economy and their prices an initial set of estimates have given the base line for pakistan s economy which has allowed some early policy simulations the generality of the model is also encouraging for its application to other economies the second session of the conference was chaired by dr rashid amjad entitled provincial accounts and decentralization hafiz a pasha professor emeritus at the beaconhouse national university presented his work on resource mobilization by provincial governments the objective of the paper was first to assess the size of the tax bases of various progressive provincial taxes like the agricultural income tax urban immoveable property tax stamp duty on property transactions and the sales tax on services second an estimate was made of the revenue potential of these taxes if adequate reforms in tax policy and administration are implemented third the provincial governments also have significantly non tax revenue sources which remain largely unexploited the paper formulated proposals for higher recovery and for using the water rate as a mechanism for improved water efficiency other non tax sources like highway tolls fees for higher education charges etc were also examined in the paper the second session was concluded by the paper entitled using nighttime light data to estimate sub national gdp and growth in pakistan written by theresa chaudhry professor lahore school of economics and co authored with mahnoor asif teaching fellow at the lahore school of economics the authored applied newly developed techniques that utilize night time light data collected by satellite and published by the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration the authors used this data first to allocate estimates of the total gdp of pakistan into its provincial components incorporating both documented official gdp and an estimate of informal economic activity second to estimate provincial and district level gdp and total income growth rates and third to relate growth in revenue collection to growth in gdp and total income the third session of the conference chaired by dr rashid amjad focused on public finance in pakistan the session started with the paper entitled external debt management 2019 2024 presented by syed kalim hyder senior economist at monetary policy department of the state bank of pakistan co authored with mehak ejaz assistant professor szabist karachi pakistan with the objective to analyze the dynamics of the external liabilities in pakistan this research applied a probabilistic approach to estimate future debt paths for pakistan furthermore the fan charts of public debt to gdp trajectories were simulated from the estimated fiscal reaction functions dr muhammad ashfaq ahmed director general international taxes federal board of revenue islamabad and dr inayat u mangla professor of finance at the lahore school of economics presented their work entitled pakistan the fiscal crisis management 2019 24 the revenue perspective the study provided a political economy perspective on pakistan s fiscal crisis management during 201924 period the paper inventively plugs in the theory of political settlements to contend that pakistan s fiscal woes are cast in the structural formation of the polity and that the structural fault lines necessarily stem from insufficient political settlementization i e fragmentation of the base between the federation and the federating units insufficiency of the fiscal base on account of absence of wealth tax inheritance tax capital gains tax and gift tax from the statute book brute secrecy in the economic domain and erosion of the state s fiscal base through reckless vanity agreementization with the outside world in summation the wanton ways with which the exchequer has been managed over the past few decades is no more sustainable and that in order for the tax system to generate both healthy and sufficient revenues substantial investments are required to be made into the system as necessary inputs before expected outputs can be derived which would require a gestation period of a couple years at the least and that too after sufficient political settlement has been arrived at a broader level in key areas of the extractive function jamshed y uppal associate professor of finance at the busch school of business and economics catholic university of america washington dc co authored with mahmood khalid senior research economist at fiscal and monetary section pakistan institute of development economics pide presented on pakistan s recurring fiscal crisis institutional strategies for fiscal consolidation the paper explores how pakistan s perennial fiscal deficits are rooted in its politico economic institutions the paper examined political institutions and budgetary processes that may affect the fiscal policy in the context of pakistan the paper concluded that instilling fiscal discipline would remain intractable unless approached in its entirety in a comprehensive strategy the long term solutions must be found in the development of political institutions and improved governance the real challenge may lie in summoning the political will and raising public awareness to implement the required measures the last paper of the session and day one of the conference entitled challenges in monetary policy management planning for the future was presented by ahmad masood khalid professor of economics and dean of school of business and economics universiti brunei darussalam co authored with obiyathulla ismath bacha international centre for education in islamic affiance inceif malaysia the paper proposed that the risk sharing instruments will ease the pressure on interest rate changes and will also help to provide stability to exchange rate avoiding unnecessary central bank intervention these instruments can help improve macroeconomic stability through the avoidance of pro cyclical policies contagion and the minimization of trigger points for financial distress such as sudden stops for society at large this improved efficiency should reduce moral hazard and lead to better allocation of resources day one ended with the lively and entertaining conference dinner
beyond the belt and road infrastructure projects thousands of entrepreneurs from china are also setting up on the continent thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe by emily feng in igbesa and david pilling in lagos wilson wu has big plans for the free trade zone he manages in igbesa a scruffy town in ogun state some 60km from the frenzy of lagos nigeria s huge commercial capital casting his gaze over what is today a small cluster of industrial warehouses surrounded by mud roads and bush mr wu can see an altogether brighter future we will have a five star hotel a golf club a walmart he says in a well rehearsed pitch it will be like dubai an electrical engineer by profession mr wu s journey to west africa followed an assignment as a young man to myanmar where he worked for power construction corporation of china a state owned group upgrading the electricity grid in 2011 hungry for more adventure he packed his bags and headed for nigeria where still barely 30 years old he was tapped up to manage the ogun state free trade zone a private public project in which the local government provides the land and chinese enterprise the capital mr wu is one of hundreds of thousands of chinese citizens a common estimate is about 1m who have ventured to africa over the past two decades to seek their fortune like many who have ended up there he sees in africa s raw energy and ambition an echo of the forces that were unleashed by deng xiaoping s reforms of 1978 it is like the china of the 1970s and 1980s when you could open a business and maybe earn a fortune he enthuses those kind of fortunes are not possible in china today people like mr wu have been persuaded to test their ambition in far flung corners of the world by tougher business conditions in china where rising labour costs industrial overcapacity and more stringent environmental standards are taking their toll while many entrepreneurs have looked closer to home to countries such as cambodia others have struck out to africa it is china s massive infrastructure projects including dams railways ports and telecommunications networks that capture most attention between 2000 and 2014 the stock of chinese investment in africa went from 2 per cent of us levels to 55 per cent mckinsey estimates that at the current breakneck pace china will surpass us levels within a decade washington has belatedly woken up to china s growing presence which is transforming both the physical and diplomatic landscape of africa in december john bolton donald trump s national security adviser accused china of using bribes opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in africa captive to beijing s wishes and demands china in nigeria 10 000 chinese companies operating in africa including 920 in nigeria and 861 in zambia mckinsey 500bn value of african industrial output handled by chinese businesses about 12 of the total mckinsey 9 manufacturing s contribution to nigerian gross domestic product world bank yet large companies such as huawei and big state affiliated companies such as china bridge and road are not the only chinese actors reshaping the continent what officials in washington may not fully understand is that thousands of hardscrabble entrepreneurs like mr wu involved in everything from retail and factories to farming are having just as big an impact irene yuan sun an associate partner at mckinsey and author of a book on chinese investment in africa says the influence is particularly strong in manufacturing chinese manufacturing investment is the best hope that africa has to industrialise in this generation she says chinese involvement in africa is not just about state driven efforts a just as large if not larger component is these private enterprises which are more job intensive which localise quicker and which have a much larger economic and social impact when mr wu first came to ogun there was virtually nothing in place the state s free trade zone he manages is majority owned by guangdong new south group a private chinese conglomerate with interests in everything from medicine to coal mining mr wu s team was given a 2 24 sq km patch of land and told to get on with it nigeria like countries across africa has a huge infrastructure deficit it lacks reliable power water and all weather roads new south group has had to build almost everything from scratch including natural gas powered generators and yet to be paved roads connecting the zone to lagos and beyond it is like managing a country mr wu says of the zone which is designed to be an enclave of efficiency and stability in nigeria s notoriously unpredictable business environment we have our own customs our own police our own operations the government of nigeria provided the land we used all our own money to build everything else after seven years in operation the free trade zone has 50 registered companies including two ceramic manufacturers producing tiles and plates a steel pipe plant and factories making everything from furniture to tomato sauce there is a printing business a plastic recycling company and another specialising in construction materials for mr wu the next 15 to 20 years will see a massive expansion to 10 000 companies 200 times the number today we will have eight different industrial sectors he says we will have different zones for electronics for tiles construction in the future we will have a university for research and development nigeria has the conditions to be a factory of the world says zhou pingjian china s ambassador to nigeria it should become the factory of the world if that is nigeria s putative future for now mr wu and thousands of chinese entrepreneurs in the country like him have to contend with the present manufacturing made up just 9 per cent of gross domestic product in 2017 according to the world bank and president muhammadu buhari who was re elected in february has complained that nigeria imports everything from toothpicks to tomato purée like other countries in africa nigeria s manufacturing ecosystem has withered since the 1980s partly thanks to a poorly executed industrial policy that saw the state lavish billions on white elephant projects an irony of chinese entrepreneurs setting up factories in the country and in other parts of africa such as ethiopia and rwanda is that the import of cheap chinese goods was another factor in destroying local production nigeria has also been hit by the oil exporter curse which pushed up the exchange rate making it cheaper to import finished goods than produce them the country s once thriving textile industry is today a pale shadow of itself because of a shortage of all but the most basic raw materials most chinese factories in nigeria are limited to final assembly they rely on imported parts and inputs mostly from china which means they need to access scarce foreign currency and coax supplies past sometimes obstructive port officials the currency volatility is just too high says wing liao the founder of winghan a chinese furniture brand with a factory in ogun state when there is profit a fluctuation in currency exchange rates can wipe it all out wing liao who owns the winghan furniture factory tom saater ft to get hold of foreign exchange chinese entrepreneurs have had to get creative many say they buy nigerian raw materials such as timber and marble which they then export to buyers in china or europe in exchange for chinese renminbi rings of chinese money changers specialise in matching those needing foreign currency with willing chinese buyers of nigerian imports once the ship leaves port and has its papers signed by the port authorities you can collect your money says ban yushi manager of a beijing based mining company lack of inputs and scarcity of foreign exchange are just two of the obstacles faced by chinese entrepreneurs rightly or wrongly they complain about the skill levels of nigerian workers the product of a state education system that has deteriorated over recent decades the machines are often too difficult to operate for local employees says chen donghua a shoe factory manager at the lee group a manufacturer owned by hong kong entrepreneurs but because local labour is cheap they can still package them by hand mr chen s company provides training to employees who he says in practice have little above an elementary school education chinese businessmen also have to negotiate past nigeria s bureaucratic gatekeepers for permits and licences to visit a government official here you best have around 6 000 to 10 000 with you says mr ban the miner otherwise forget about getting an appointment there are cultural obstacles too across the continent africans accuse chinese workers of refusing to integrate many of them choose to work in unmarked offices and dormitories away from the prying eyes of authorities and potential competitors hanson huang the deputy general manager of the free trade zone tom saater ft the free trade zone in ogun state they are accused too of bringing in their own labour though companies have quickly learnt they need to provide local employment if they want to stay in business from the perspective of chinese workers thousands of miles from home in an unfamiliar environment life can also be tough this place is very lonely says peng hong who manages a medicine manufacturing company in lagos and kano which employs around 350 nigerians and 45 chinese mr peng arrived in west africa in 2005 from landlocked hubei province in central china where he says life is too hard life has been hard in nigeria too we import most of our food and cook for our chinese employees he says on the weekends mr peng organises company outings for his mostly male employees to the supermarket or to lagos only chinese style karaoke bar like many arrivals mr peng has had to battle we had to clear all the trees drill our water wells rig our own electrical transmission lines he says when i first came here we had to light candles after 4pm because there was no stable electricity we could not sleep because of the heat so we would sleep outside in the courtyard chinese entrepreneurs complain too that the authorities talk big but often fail to deliver the expansion of ogun s free trade zone for example is being held up by the state s inability or unwillingness to buy up land from local chiefs chinese executives say chinese views about their host communities can be blunt nigeria has the most thieves in the world says thomas liu who runs the medicine company where mr peng works using the sort of uncompromising language that grates from accra to kinshasa you have to avoid being tricked workers designing ceramic plates in the factory inside the free trade zone a worker during the final stage of heating ceramics in ogun nigeria yet despite their myriad complaints they say fortunes beckon if i could give advice to my former self it would be move faster says kent chan the manager of grand shine construction materials he set up his first factory in nigeria in 2015 i actually wanted to come in 2014 but then ebola broke out if i had come that year i think business would be have been even better the influx is by no means limited to nigeria mckinsey estimates there are more than 10 000 chinese businesses operating in africa 90 per cent of them privately owned drawing on the flying geese concept of japanese economist kaname akamatsu researchers at the china africa research initiative at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies argue that as costs in china rise manufacturing will gradually shift to regions like africa between 2000 and 2015 chinese companies registered more than 1 000 african manufacturing proposals with the commerce ministry in glass recycled steel ceramics gypsum board textiles dying tanneries and shoe factories to name but a few chinese companies including garment makers in tanzania and lesotho relocated not only because of cheaper labour costs they were also drawn by the prospect of tariff free exports to the us under the african growth and opportunity act and to the eu under the everything but arms agreement in ethiopia huajian from china and new wing from hong kong were attracted by the country s high grade leather the researchers at sais found once companies gain a foothold in one country many seek to expand new south group aims to open 10 industrial zones like the one in ogun state across africa starting with a 700 acre facility near the kenyan city of eldoret that began business in february it plans to open in ghana and angola where as in nigeria reliance on oil exports has devastated local manufacturing in nigeria as in much of africa chinese investment provokes suspicion as well as praise but for the most part officials welcome the attention jonathan coker nigeria s former ambassador to beijing says western warnings about chinese investments are hypocritical recommended chinese investment extends its influence in nigeria diplomats say we will become slaves of china this is the propaganda of the west he says instead he adds nigeria has much to learn china is 10 times the size of nigeria s population but they have developed a system that can take care of their people these are the examples we want to adapt not all chinese entrepreneurs have a positive impact in madagascar they are blamed for illegal exports of rosewood and zebu a type of cattle chinese demand for african wildlife also fuels poaching from zambia to mozambique nor does ms sun see the arrival of chinese entrepreneurs as a magic bullet the author accepts that along with the promise of factories and jobs they may bring environmental degradation and friction with african communities but they are extremely entrepreneurial and they are doing profoundly important things she says not all good not all bad but we have to pay attention copyright the

drive increases in arix nav at year end our gross portfolio value the combined holding value of our core and discovery portfolios was 175m which includes a net positive revaluation of 70m the strong performance has predominantly been driven by valuation increases in autolus logicbio and harpoon and offset by a decline in value of iterum the most substantial of these uplifts autolus delivered an increase of 56m over the year following the successful completion of an ipo on nasdaq and subsequent positive share price momentum autolus continued to make clinical progress in the period initiating further clinical trials and reporting initial phase 1 safety and efficacy data in its auto3 programmes in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia pall and diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl five

investment in 2019 and look forward to the year ahead with confidence and optimism joe anderson phd chief executive officer operational and financial review cfo statement overview the year to december 2018 has been one of significant financial progress particularly in driving growth in our gross portfolio value which has increased to 175 5m 2017 53 9m this is reflected in the increased strength of the group balance sheet where the net asset value nav of the arix group has grown by over 100m to 270 2m 2017 146 4m this growth in group nav has been supported by a strong net revaluation gain for the year of 51 2m 2017 5 5m which has helped deliver a profit before tax of 42 8m 2017 9 5m loss the gross portfolio value gpv comprising our core portfolio and discovery portfolio is shown at fair value at 175 5m 2017 53 9m at the year end representing an increase of 225 over the last 12 months the remaining component of investments is our other interests at the balance sheet date these are held at a fair value of 8 5m 2017 17 4m the movement being predominantly due to impairments to the carried interest of the wales life sciences invesment fund and in biomotiv core portfolio the core portfolio has grown from nine companies to 11 in 2018 with the value of these companies increasing from 50 6m to 169 3m driven by both the investment activity in the year and the strong revaluation gains enjoyed in the period notably by autolus which listed on the nasdaq exchange in june autolus was not alone as iterum therapeutics and logicbio therapeutics also listed during 2018 in addition harpoon therapeutics was in preparation for its ipo at year end and went on to successfully list early in 2019 all of our quoted investments are shown at the closing market price at the balance sheet date the valuation of harpoon reflects a portion of the uplift arising between its november 2018 funding round and its february 2019 ipo discovery portfolio our emerging investments are held within our discovery portfolio this asset class is important to the future development of the core portfolio as it provides a crèche to develop emerging innovation and explore commercial opportunities the discovery portfolio is held at a fair value of 6 2m 2017 3 3m and includes a number of pre clinical investments plus other seed investments made during the year as new projects become established they will be moved from the discovery portfolio to the core portfolio portfolio valuation methodology i have highlighted in previous reports the strong focus on high levels of integrity when it comes to the valuation of our investments this is both embedded in our culture and in our governance as it is overseen by our audit and risk committee arix follows international private equity and venture capital ipev guidelines which are compliant with international financial reporting standards you can read the detailed accounting policy on pages 108 to 109 in determining the valuation of its portfolio arix applies a valuation hierarchy for example a quoted market price has the highest integrity and is used as a source of valuation wherever possible as an alternative for unquoted stocks arix may use a recent arm s length market transaction as this is considered to have an acceptably high level of integrity a discounted cash flow dcf methodology is considered to have the lowest level of integrity and is not used where a methodology with a higher level of integrity is available no investments within our core portfolio or discovery portfolio have been valued using dcf methodology at december 2018 consolidated profit and loss strong performance in the year has delivered a profit before tax pbt of 42 8m 2017 loss of 9 5m the key feature of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income is the net revaluation gains of 51 2m 2017 5 5m this strong pbt has created the need for a deferred tax liability of 5 9m this year the net revaluation gains of 51 2m were driven principally by autolus therapeutics which showed a positive revaluation of 55 9m in the year along with logicbio therapeutics which also had a significant upward valuation in the period of 14 1m these were partially offset by iterum therapeutics which following its successful ipo recorded a negative revaluation of 8 4m in the period revenues of 1 3m 2017 1 9m are predominantly management fees in arix capital management these have decreased year on year in line with expectations as the fully invested wales life sciences investment fund enters the second half of its investment life a significant exit for the fund was successfully completed early in 2019 and this will contribute to a reduced fee level going forward administrative expenses for the year were 11 7m 2017 11 0m these costs included ceo search fees of 0 3m the board changes announced on 19 february 2019 enable a leaner management team in arix the cost savings from these changes along with other expected savings from a premises review which is currently under way will reduce annual run rate costs by approximately 1 5m going forwards 2019 will reflect the part year implementation of these cost reductions cash position cash and deposits on the balance sheet has also strengthened during the year to 91 2m 2017 74 9m following a successful capital raising in march 2018 which delivered net proceeds of 83 5m this cash position will allow investment momentum to be carried into 2019 the consolidated balance sheet shows that of the 91 2m held 60 2m is held on long term deposit which is defined as a term of over three months the use of longer term deposits has contributed to improved levels of interest income earned this year treasury policy the main objectives of the treasury policy are the preservation of shareholders funds for investment purposes and the mitigation of counterparty risk the policy achieves these twin aims by requiring that cash balances are held at a number of uk banks with strong credit ratings the treasury policy was revised and reapproved by the board this year to allow a greater proportion of funds to be placed as term deposits and as a result net interest income increased to 0 7m 2017 nil speculation on currency movements is specifically not permitted by the policy and foreign currency hedging transactions are also outside of the policy therefore no currency hedging transactions were entered into during the year and balance sheet assets in foreign currency are not hedged against sterling the impact of currency exchange rates is shown on the face of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as a gain of 4 6m however it should be noted that these are not realised amounts during the second half of 2018 due to the foreseen risk of brexit weakening sterling particularly against us dollars our cash balances held in non sterling were positioned to include sufficient us dollars to allow us to match our known future dollar funding commitments to portfolio companies for 2019 in this way we have been able to protect our investment activity against expected volatile foreign exchange rates for the coming year employee benefit trust during the year under review an employee benefits trust ebt was created this trust is managed by an independent board of trustees the role of the trust is to efficiently provide employment benefits to arix employees which is particularly important to the retention proposition for key staff such as our investment team in line with international financial reporting standards the results of the trust are consolidated into the group financials within this annual report impact of brexit the arix business model requires the sourcing and funding of biotech and life science investment opportunities and this is not expected to materially change after brexit this is because arix sources investment opportunities globally and is not constrained to the uk or european markets there is a risk that possible reductions in research grants could affect the number of biotech investment opportunities becoming available but this is considered unlikely to have a material impact on arix s global pipeline of opportunities future trends the implementation of new cfius legislation in the us is intended to protect us technology from foreign interest and will bring increased administration and operational risk to many us investment opportunities including those in the biotech sector whilst arix as a uk company is well positioned to continue to take part in us biotech investment opportunities going forward we will continue to monitor this and other emerging legislation as we go through 2019 emerging regulation arix capital management is a subsidiary of arix bioscience plc and regulated by the fca accordingly it will be subject to the new senior management certification regime sm cr with effect from 9 december 2019 the sm cr is part of the uk regulator s drive to improve culture governance and especially accountability across the financial services sector and preparation is under way to ensure a seamless adoption of sm cr ahead of the implementation date later this year after the

monitors a number of principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the business these include financial non financial internal and external concerns risk management framework the directors are able to manage the business and achieve its strategic objectives due to an effective risk management framework which features multiple layers board managing risk is a key responsibility of the board who set a strong tone in line with best practice corporate governance key committees the audit and risk committee oversees the effectiveness of the risk management processes the remuneration committee ensures incentives and reward are balanced and appropriate for achieving the strategy the nomination committee addresses the need for continuing strength at the senior levels of the company and is responsible for succession planning executive management the management team is responsible for identifying assessing and mitigating the day to day operational risks portfolio company boards and independent assurance the boards of our portfolio companies are responsible for ensuring they meet key commercial objectives and in this they are typically supported by senior members of the arix bioscience team who also sit on their boards independent assurance is provided by industry experts when required for example duff phelps is engaged to provide regulatory compliance support to the board of arix capital management arix bioscience s fca regulated fund management subsidiary principal risks and uncertainties the principal risks to arix have been robustly assessed in light of the current environment these along with the steps taken by arix to manage such risks are detailed below risk impact mitigation 1 arix s portfolio companies may not generate the financial returns that are anticipated arix s net assets increasingly comprise a range of portfolio companies below forecast performance from a portfolio company may adversely affect arix s profitability and ability to generate positive cash flows from future realisations arix has an experienced team responsible for identifying and developing portfolio companies resulting in a high standard of due diligence before the commitment of any money post investment arix typically has representatives on the company s board of directors ensuring it is fully aware of business developments and allowing for mitigation of possible issues as they arise arix funds a range of portfolio companies and continues to develop its portfolio across a range of interests as such it will achieve a diverse portfolio with financial performance not overly reliant on any one business arix deploys capital to portfolio companies at all stages of a company s life cycle therefore it is exposed not only to very early stage businesses but also holds interests in more mature companies where risk of failure is reduced 2 loss of key personnel to competitors or from an external event the financial performance of arix depends on its ability to identify and develop outstanding portfolio companies and as such is reliant on its key personnel loss of key individuals could affect arix s financial performance and future prospects arix has a market appropriate remuneration scheme for its senior employees this includes share incentive schemes which reward personnel for long term service and performance arix has three senior management members making up the executive committee performing active day to day roles who are able to provide emergency cover for each other over a short period the investment team comprises five individuals who offer cross team support in the event of an absence therefore the loss of a single key member of the investment or management team would be mitigated by the stature and experience of others within the organization arix s nomination committee is responsible for appropriate succession planning 3 adverse market conditions may impact arix s operational model an economic downturn may reduce opportunities for arix to realise capital from portfolio companies affecting cash flow and financial performance if business valuations are reduced the availability of capital for any external fundraising by arix or its portfolio companies may also be affected arix s strategy is to deploy capital into innovative businesses which have unique high impact outcomes arix believes that such businesses are less susceptible to macroeconomic cycles arix has funded portfolio companies across a range of geographies including the uk usa europe canada israel and australia as such it is not overly reliant on a downturn or market shock in a single geography arix monitors its availability of capital closely ensuring sufficient balances are available for the continuing operation of the business throughout the period assessed in the viability statement 4 changes to government policy or regulation in the research healthcare or life sciences industries a change in government regulation for example cfius in the united states may adversely affect the profitability of the healthcare and life sciences industry reducing possibly the number of investment opportunities availability of external funding or potential exit opportunities arix s portfolio is diversified by geography with exposure to the uk usa europe canada israel and australia as such the portfolio is diversified against the adverse actions of any one government 5 brexit may have an impact beyond the risks described above in terms of by severity of a downturn or the nature of the impact specific impacts could include a depressed uk capital market that does not support the raising of capital a reduction in government funded research in biotech leading to reduced investment opportunities arix has the ability to withstand a depressed capital market including the ability to dispose of a portion of its listed investments withhold funds that are reserved for the existing portfolio the ability to issue up to 10 of share capital to a new investor and the possibility to arrange loan finance secured on its balance sheet assets arix also holds cash reserves to cover two years of operating costs arix s investment appetite is unconstrained globally resulting in a pipeline with a broad geographical spread this means that a variation in the pipeline of opportunities coming from one country would not materially damage arix s ability to continue its core business viability statement the board has assessed the prospects of arix over a period greater than 12 months we have considered a period of three years from the balance sheet date as the board expects the majority of arix s current commitments and new proceeds raised to be committed over the next three years the board has carried out a rigorous assessment of the principal risks and their mitigants noted above the board assessed arix s business model particularly its approach to future cash commitments to existing portfolio companies one key area modelled is the ability to manage the risk of over commitment to portfolio companies by reviewing cash flow projections which included scenarios with differing impacts to the cash flow forecast inputs key judgements reflected how future cash requirements may change from restrictive regulations and how availability of capital may be restricted from the loss of key personnel based on its review and the consideration of any changes that had occurred post year end the board has a reasonable expectation that arix will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over a three year period from the date of this report and confirm that preparing the financial statements on a going concern basis is appropriate jonathan peacock chairman 28 march 2019

office is 20 berkeley square london w1j 6eq the registered number is 09777975 2 accounting policies a basis of preparation the consolidated financial statements of the arix group have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs and interpretations issued by the ifrs interpretations committee ifrs ic applicable to companies reporting under ifrs as adopted by the european union the financial statements comply with ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb as adopted by the european union the financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial assets which have been measured at fair value the financial statements are presented in british pounds sterling which is the functional and presentational currency of the company and the presentational currency of the group balances are presented in thousands of british pounds sterling unless otherwise stated the arix group has applied all standards and interpretations issued by the iasb that were effective at the period end date the accounting policies set out below have unless otherwise stated been applied consistently to all periods presented use of judgements and estimates in preparing these financial statements management has made judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the arix group s accounting policies and reported amounts of assets liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from those estimates estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively significant estimates are made by the arix group when determining the appropriate methodology for valuing investments see note 2 i and share based payments see note 2 o and note 18 in preparing these financial statements the directors have considered the relationship that the group has with the wales life sciences investment fund the wlsif and specifically as to whether the group controls wlsif the directors note that while arix capital management limited a 100 subsidiary of arix bioscience plc in its role as fund manager to wlsif and arthurian life sciences spv gp limited a 100 subsidiary of arix bioscience plc in its role as general partner of the wlsif both exercise power over the activities of wlsif they do not have sufficient exposure to variability of returns from wlsif to meet the definition of control and therefore acts as agents rather than principals of wlsif accordingly wlsif has not been consolidated into these financial statements b basis of consolidation subsidiaries subsidiaries are entities over which the arix group has control the arix group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases the acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the group the consolidated financial

the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset associates associates are entities over which the group has significant influence but does not control generally accompanied by a shareholding of between 20 and 50 of the voting rights no associates are presented on the statement of financial position as the group elects to hold such investments at fair value through profit and loss this treatment is permitted by ias 28 investment in associates and joint ventures which permits investments held by entities that are akin to venture capital organizations to be excluded from its measurement methodology requirements where those investments are designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement changes in fair value of associates are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change occurs the group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business the disclosures required by section 409 of the companies act 2006 for associated undertakings are included in note 11 to the financial statements similarly those investments which may not have qualified as associate but fall within the wider scope of significant holdings and so are subject to section 409 disclosure acts are also included in note 11 to the financial statements wlsif is considered neither a subsidiary nor an associate as detailed in note 2 a c adoption of new and revised standards certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been applied by the group from 1 january 2018 the group s assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below ifrs 9 financial instruments addresses the classification measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets the group has determined that its investments are held for long periods of time and are not held for the benefit of any contractual cash flows on this basis such investments are classified as financial assets at fair value in profit and loss under ifrs 9 this is consistent with the group s previous treatment under ias39 so there is no change in treatment and no impact on the financial statements the group s cash and receivable balances are held with the expectation that these will be realised by collecting the contractual cash flows associated with them under ifrs 9 such financial assets are held at amortised cost this is consistent with the group s previous treatment under ias 39 so there is no change in treatment and no material impact on the financial statements ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers applies to the recognition of revenue this has replaced ias 18 which covered contracts for goods and services and ias 11 which covered construction contracts the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a good or service transfers to a customer the group has assessed its sources of revenue namely fund management fees non executive director fees receivable and determined that there was no change in how each revenue source is recognised compared to the previous treatment under ias18 therefore there has been no impact on the financial statements certain new accounting standards and interpretations are effective for the annual period beginning on or after 1 january 2019 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements ifrs 16 leases this standard replaces the current guidance in ias 17 leases and is a far reaching change in accounting by lessees in particular under ias 17 lessees were required to make a distinction between a finance lease on balance sheet and an operating lease off balance sheet ifrs 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a right of use asset for virtually all lease contracts ifrs 16 includes an optional exemption for certain short term leases and leases of low value assets however this exemption can only be applied by lessees for lessors the accounting remains substantially unchanged ifrs 16 provides updated guidance on the definition of a lease as well as the guidance on the combination and separation of contracts under ifrs 16 a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration the standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the group has carried out an assessment of the impact of the standard and concluded that there will be no significant impact on the financial statements as such the group intends to apply a simplified transition approach and will not restate comparative amounts for years prior to the first application d revenue recognition revenue is generated from fund management fees transaction fees and from non executive directors fees receivable fund management fees are earned as a percentage of fund commitments managed and are recognised in the period in which these services are provided transaction fees are typically earned as a fixed percentage of funds provided and are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction non executive directors fees are recognised on an accruals basis e foreign currency translation the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to group s presentational currency british pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the period end date the revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve f leases rents payable under operating leases are charged against income on a straight line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on such a basis g exceptional items items that are material in size and unusual in nature are disclosed separately to provide a more accurate indication of underlying performance h property plant and equipment property plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets office equipment three years fixtures and fittings five years office furniture five years leasehold property five years i financial assets the arix group classifies its financial assets as either at fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost the classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets have been acquired and is determined on initial recognition amortised cost are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market they are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period these are classified as non current assets the arix group s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of financial position regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date the date on which the arix group commits to purchase or sell the asset financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the arix group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership equity investments those investments in the arix group that are held with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains are recognised as equity investments within the scope of ifrs 9 and are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss this includes investments in associated undertakings as per note 11 when financial assets are recognised initially they are measured at fair value plus in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss directly attributable transaction costs they are subsequently remeasured at their fair value if a valuation event occurs a valuation event may include technical measures such as product development phases financial events such as further injection of capital and sales events such as product launches fair value hierarchy the arix group classifies financial assets using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the related fair value measurements the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a financial asset is classified is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to that asset s fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy has the following levels level 1 the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period the quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group is the current bid price level 2 the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example over the counter derivatives is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates if all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable the instrument is included in level 2 level 3 if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data the instrument is included in level 3 this is the case for unlisted equity securities valuation of investments the fair value of quoted investments is based on bid prices at the period end date the fair value of unlisted securities is established initially at cost subsequently the fair value is determined using the international private equity and venture capital valuation guidelines december 2015 ipev guidelines the valuation methodology primarily used by the arix group is the price of recent investment a milestone analysis approach or the net asset value of a direct investment in a fund investments made in seed start up and early stage companies often have no current and no short term future earnings or positive cash flows in such circumstances it can be difficult to gauge the probability and financial impact of the success or failure of development or research activities and to make reliable cash flow forecasts consequently the most appropriate approach to determine fair value is a methodology primarily based on the price of a recent investment where the arix group considers that the unadjusted price of investment may no longer be relevant the group carries out an enhanced assessment based on milestone analysis in applying the milestone analysis approach to investments in companies in early or development stages the group seeks to determine whether there is an indication of change in fair value the following factors are considered when calculating the fair value where the investment being valued was itself made recently its cost will generally provide a good indication of fair value unless there is objective observable evidence that the investment has since been impaired where there has been a recent investment by a third party the price of that investment will provide a basis of the valuation if there is no readily ascertainable value or recent transaction the arix group considers alternative ipev guidelines methodologies principally being discounted cash flows and price earnings multiples in these instances a price to earnings multiple is derived from an equivalent business that is considered a suitable proxy an appropriate discount is applied to the price earnings multiple for risks inherent to early stage businesses where a fair value cannot be estimated reliably perhaps because of a lack of either revenue or earnings the investment is reported at carrying value unless there is evidence that the investment has been impaired or there has been a milestone event a milestone event may include technical measures such as product development phases and patent approvals financial measures such as cash burn rate and profitability expectations and market and sales measures such as testing phases product launches and market introductions indicators of impairment might include delayed progress technical complications or financial difficulties and where the equity structure in an investment involves different class rights in a sale or liquidity event the arix group takes these different rights into account when forming a view of the fair value of its investment the valuation metrics used in these financial statements are discussed in note 11 although the directors use their best judgement and cross reference results of primary valuation models against secondary models in estimating the fair value of investments there are inherent limitations in any estimation techniques whilst fair value estimates presented herein attempt to present the amount the arix group could realise in a current transaction the final realisation may be different as future events will also affect the current estimates of fair value the effects of such events on the estimates of fair value including the ultimate liquidation of investments could be material to the financial statements this is particularly significant for the arix group s interest in the carried interest vehicle of the wales life sciences investment fund carried interest is the fund manager s share of the fund s profits once investors have received a return over a specified hurdle underlying companies within the fund are at an early stage of their lives and are generally held at a value equal to cost until a milestone is reached this makes the valuation of the carried interest sensitive to the assumptions used regarding the size and timing of realisations this information is then used to determine the carried interest valuation using a discounted cash flow model further assumptions are made in this calculation with the final balance being particularly sensitive to the choice of discount rate a liquidity discount is also applied any ultimate gain for the arix group from this holding may be materially different from the current fair value from 1 january 2019 the group will adopt the international private equity and venture capital valuation guidelines december 2018 treatment of gains and losses arising on fair value realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are included in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise recognition of financial assets purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method impairment of financial assets at the end of each reporting period the group assesses whether there is objective evidence that its loans and other receivables are impaired the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset s original effective interest rate the asset s carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within administrative expenses if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised the reversal of the previously recognised impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within administrative expenses the group s financial assets that are subject to ifrs 9 s new expected credit loss model are its loans and receivables cash and cash equivalents and cash on long term deposit the identified impairment loss is considered immaterial financial assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously the legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default insolvency or bankruptcy of the arix group or the counterparty where these conditions are met the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position j cash and cash equivalents and cash on long term deposit cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand call deposits and bank overdrafts cash on long term deposit comprises cash held on term deposit for a period of at least three months k goodwill and intangible assets intangibles were acquired by the arix group as part of the acquisition of arix capital management limited and arthurian life sciences spv gp limited it is the policy of the arix group to amortise these fair values over the period in which the arix group is expected to obtain economic benefit from the related intangible assets the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill if those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income as a bargain purchase l share capital ordinary shares and series c shares are classified as equity equity instruments issued by the arix group are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs own shares represent shares of arix bioscience plc that are held by an employee share trust for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share plans own shares are treated as a deduction from equity until the shares are cancelled reissued or disposed of and when vest are transferred from own shares to retained earnings at their weighted average cost m trade payables trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer if not they are presented as non current liabilities trade payables are initially recognised at fair value generally being the invoiced amount and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method n current and deferred taxation the tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the arix group operates and generates taxable income management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation it establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheets however the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the statement of financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis o share based payments the arix group operates an equity incentive plan and an executive share option plan in which the group s founders also participate share options must be measured at fair value and recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding increase in equity the fair value of the option is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes model and is charged as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period the charge is adjusted each year to reflect the expected and actual level of vesting estimation uncertainty arises with this balance as the calculation incorporates assumptions for share price exercise price expected volatility based on similar quoted companies risk free interest rate and share option term in addition to management share options the group has also provided founders shares which are classed as a share based payment as no service conditions are attached to these shares the incremental accounting charges have been recognised immediately p financial risk management the arix group is exposed to market risk interest rate risk credit risk and liquidity risk the senior management

overview the lurch lower in global interest rates continue the us 10 year yield is at new 15 month lows five basis points through the average effective fed funds rate late yesterday it appeared that 10 year german bund yields slipped below similar japanese government bond yields for the first time since q4 16 but when the jgb market opened it the 10 year jgb yield fell a couple more basis points to minus 10 the most negative since august 2016 the 10 year bund yield is steady near minus eight basis points peripheral european yields are firmer as they are tarred with the risk off brush that is keeping equities on the defensive the large bourses in asia japan china korea taiwan and australia weakened but some smaller markets and india were more resilient barring a sharp sell off tomorrow indian shares are poised to extend their advance for a sixth consecutive week european shares are mixed to higher with the dow jones stoxx 600 trying to extend its gains for third sessions us shares are trading with a slightly heavier bias most of the major currencies are a little lower with the yen and antipodean currencies the exceptions emerging market currencies are nearly all weaker with short squeeze in turkey have faltered pushing the lira down nearly 5 at pixel time despite the overnight swap rate soaring above 1000 the risk is that the short squeeze will deter international investors who will be asked to refinance some 177 bln of foreign currency debt coming due over the next year asia pacific japan s ministry of finance reported portfolio flows on a weekly basis the large moves in stocks and bonds and the approaching fiscal year end has seen sharp moves by japanese and foreign investors last week japanese investors bought jpy1 1 trillion of foreign bonds it is the second largest buying spree this year they were small sellers of foreign shares offshore investors were larger sellers of japanese bonds and stocks they sold jpy1 5 trillion of japanese bonds the most this week while they sold jpy1 1 trillion of japanese stocks over the past three weeks foreign investors sold jpy3 7 trillion of japanese stocks which appears to be a record they have only bought japanese shares one week here in q1 the economic calendar will pick up now tomorrow japan reports employment industrial output and retail sales while jobs reports should be little changed the february factory output and retail sales are expected to have bounced back from a poor january early monday in tokyo the march tankan survey will be released and sentiment is expected to have weakened in most categories though large non manufacturers may have fared best capital expenditure plans were likely slashed china reports its official pmi over the weekend south korea will report industrial output figures tomorrow and trade figures early monday in seoul trade seemed to improve as the month so the year over year contraction appears to have eased compared with january and february the dollar has traded between jpy110 00 and jpy110 50 today it found a good bid in early europe just above jpy110 where a 965 mln option will be cut today there is an option that expires tomorrow there for 1 2 bln there is another 840 mln option at jpy110 50 that will also expire today the australian dollar is trading near the lower end of the two week range which extends to almost 0 7050 there is an a 1 bln option struck at 0 7100 that is expiring the week s high was set near 0 7150 where a six week downtrend is found europe the uk house of commons failed to find a majority for any of eight different options to prime minister may s withdrawal bill it intends to narrow the range of options to see if a consensus can be forged two proposals did a little better than the withdrawal bill s second attempt staying in the customs union and a second referendum may capitulated to demands and offered to resign once brexit is approved but understood to be resigning in the coming months in any case this seemed to have been enough to entice some like boris johnson and duncan smith but dup continued to oppose the withdrawal bill on principle and this seems to have doomed it the timetable laid out by the ec gave the uk until the end of this week to pass the withdrawal bill in which case it would leave by may 22 a week before the european parliament elections however if the withdrawal bill is not passed the uk will have until april 12 to either leave without an agreement among the least favored options by the house of commons or seek a longer delay which would require participation in the european parliament elections a fixed extension still leaves the uk at the mercy of the eu it may be preferable to revoke article 50 with a promise to the uk that it will be triggered again when a compelling solution to the vexing problem of the irish border is resolved that seems to be the heart of the problem the good friday agreement that made for peace between northern ireland and the irish republic in essence requires the uk to stay in the eu then in 2016 in a pique 52 one percentage point more than the french gave the maastricht treaty in what is known as the petite oui of the voters chose to leave the eu and their leaders seemed to give little thought to their previous commitment one of the most remarkable aspects of the brexit mess is how united the eu has been throughout and the fragmentation of the uk eurozone money supply m3 growth accelerated to 4 3 in february from a 3 8 pace in january it is the matches last june s pace which was the best since january 2018 household lending was steady at 3 2 while lending to non financial businesses to2 6 from 2 2 the ecb will find comfort in the report on the other hand price pressures which often rise in march seem a little subdued in both spain and germany ahead of next week s report for the region spain s harmonized measure rose 1 4 on the month vs the median forecast in the bloomberg survey for 1 6 the year over year pace rose to 1 3 from 1 1 the median forecast 1 5 german state reports leading the national estimate before the end of the day in germany saw the year over year rates steady to lower given the base effect a 0 6 rise in march for the country would put the year over year rate at 1 6 down from 1 7 in february the risk is to the downside the bloomberg survey has march eurozone cpi unchanged at 1 5 and the core at 1 0 due to the different baskets measured in cpi if the us were to adopt the harmonized methodology used in europe us cpi would be nearly identical with the emu the euro remains continued to narrow ranges but the narrow ranges are lower the euro slipped to 1 1235 its lowest level since march 11 in early european turnover but quickly snapped back to 1 1260 yesterday s high was near 1 1285 the euro has not been above 1 13 since early in the us on tuesday there is a 700 mln euro option that will expire today at 1 1250 and almost 815 mln euro in an expiring option at 1 1325 there is another option there 1 1325 for 1 3 bln euros that expires tomorrow also tomorrow there is a 1 2 bln euro in options struck at 1 13 that roll off and 1 4 bln euros at 1 12 strike sterling traded down to 1 3125 a four day low in europe after being rebuffed from 1 32 in asia despite the quieter tone the one week implied volatility is still a lofty 15 5 the 20 day average of one week implied volatility is near 13 6 and the 100 day average is a little below 11 america no fewer than six fed officials speak today it would be surprising if any specifically addressed the nominee moore s call for an immediate 50 bp rate cut which might be a be reminiscent of his call for a rate hike in 2008 by reiterating the neutral stance of the fed as stated explicitly but also with the wait and see attitude moore will seem out of step with the current team including all or nearly all of trump s appointments however moore s views are closer to the market the implied yield of the january 2020 fed funds futures contract is 2 12 the current effective average is 2 40 that implies roughly one cut and a 50 chance of a second cut the us is expected to shave its estimate for q4 gdp today as consumption and trade may have been slightly greater drags on growth however the data is too old to matter to investors or policymakers tomorrow s report of february income and january expenditures are more important we expect improvement over january and december respectively and see the us economy emerging from a late cycle soft patch that may have ground the world s largest economy nearly to a halt in q1 bolstered by a robust jobs market and consumption mexico s central bank meets and there is little chance of a change in rate the overnight rate stands at 8 25 consumer inflation is running just below 4 which leaves mexico will high real rates however the high rates are meant to compensate investors for the policy uncertainty as well as the firm inflation there is also the risk posed by the peso the peso is used as a proxy for emerging market currencies which have fallen out of favor this month the peso is lower for the fourth consecutive session the dollar s high for the month is near mxn19 62 and that remains the target support now is seen in the mxn19 20 mxn19 25 area elsewhere the canadian dollar is soft with the greenback above cad1 34 and looking to test the month s high near cad1 3465

2018 hudbay acquired control of a large contiguous block of mineral rights to explore for mineable deposits within trucking distance of the constancia processing facility including the past producing caballito property and the highly prospective maria reyna and kusiorcco properties hudbay has commenced permitting community relations and technical activities required to access and conduct drilling on these properties and has been successful in reaching an agreement covering two of the properties to date with plans to drill in the fourth quarter of 2019 the caballito property located approximately three kilometres northwest of constancia is a 120 hectare 297 acre concession block and is the site of the former katanga mine which was operated by mitsui mining smelting co ltd and minera katanga at different times between the late 1970s and early 1990s the deposit at caballito is believed to consist of narrow skarn bodies developed in the contact between limestone and monzonite porphyries with copper silver and gold mineralization in hypogene sulfides the maria reyna property located within ten kilometres of constancia is a 5 850 hectare 14 456 acre concession block in 2010 diamond drilling by a previous optionee of the maria reyna property intersected copper skarn breccias and porphyry mineralization geophysical surveys and geological mapping have also been conducted on the property and hudbay believes that the area remains very prospective for additional discoveries negotiations with a local community to secure surface rights over the pampacancha deposit are progressing following the election of a new community council in the fourth quarter of 2018 hudbay continues to take a disciplined measured and patient approach to these negotiations as this has proven to be an effective way of engaging in previous instances and is consistent with its proven long term strategy for securing social license and developing its business in peru lalor mine the lalor mine achieved ore production of more than 4 500 tonnes per day in february 2019 and production since then has been in line with expectations in february 2019 hudbay announced increased mineral reserves and mineral resources for the lalor mine and nearby satellite deposits and a new mine plan that includes the processing of gold and copper gold ore at the company s new britannia mill the company expects lalor annual gold production to more than double from current levels once the new britannia mill is refurbished in 2022 average annual production of approximately 140 000 ounces is expected during the first five years at a sustaining cash cost net of by product credits of 450 per ounce1 positioning lalor as one of the lowest cost gold mines in canada current mineral reserves and

accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in canada which differ from the requirements of united states securities laws canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the canadian securities administrators national instrument 43 101 standards of disclosure for mineral projects ni 43 101 subject to the sec modernization rules described below the united states reporting requirements are currently governed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec industry guide 7 sec industry guide 7 under the securities act of 1933 as amended the definitions used in ni 43 101 are incorporated by reference from the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum cim definition standards adopted by cim council on may 10 2014 the cim definition standards for example the terms mineral reserve proven mineral reserve and probable mineral reserve are canadian mining terms as defined in ni 43 101 and these definitions differ from the definitions in sec industry guide 7 furthermore while the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by ni 43 101 these terms are not defined terms under sec industry guide 7 under sec industry guide 7 standards a final or bankable feasibility study is required to report reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority further under sec industry guide 7 mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made reserve estimates contained in this news release may not qualify as reserves under sec industry guide 7 further until recently the sec has not recognized the reporting of mineral deposits which do not meet the sec industry guide 7 definition of reserve the sec adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended these amendments became effective february 25 2019 the sec modernization rules with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec modernization rules replace the historical disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in sec industry guide 7 which will be rescinded from and after the required compliance date of the sec modernization rules as a result of the adoption of the sec modernization rules the sec now recognizes estimates of measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources in addition the sec has amended its definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves to be substantially similar to the corresponding cim definition standards incorporated by reference in ni 43 101 united states investors are cautioned that while the above terms are substantially similar to cim definitions there are differences in the definitions under the sec modernization rules and the cim definition standards accordingly there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the company may report as proven mineral reserves probable mineral reserves measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under ni 43 101 would be the same had the company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the sec modernization rules united states investors are also cautioned that while the sec will now recognize measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves accordingly investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources that the company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable further inferred mineral resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically therefore united states investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the inferred mineral resources exist in accordance with canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies except in limited circumstances where permitted under ni 43 101 for the above reasons information contained in this

introduction u s foreign policy officials have embraced economic sanctions as a tool of choice for american foreign policy decisionmakers have deployed sanctions against strategic adversaries and national security threats ranging from russia to non state actors such as terrorist groups drug cartels and businesspeople who engage in corrupt activities the appeal to both policy leaders and key constituent groups of the potent economic impacts of sanctions in several recent high profile cases particularly those of iran russia north korea and venezuela combined with broad bipartisan support for aggressive use of u s sanctions suggests that the united states will favor this policy tool and be an active practitioner in the years ahead this brief describes five of the most prominent and influential trends that could affect u s sanctions and other coercive economic measures in the future the five trends are 1 a shift toward more aggressive use of u s unilateral sanctions 2 the growing role of congress in enacting sanctions and managing their implementation 3 an increased potential for unintended consequences as a result of growing complexity in sanctions 4 accelerating efforts of foreign governments to insulate trade and payment channels from u s sanctions and 5 new technological developments that may have the potential to both enhance and weaken the impact of u s sanctions in the years ahead this brief represents solely the views of the authors who have contributed to this report in their personal capacities it does not necessarily reflect the views of other members of the task force or of any institutions with which the authors are affiliated trend 1 shift toward more aggressive use of u s unilateral sanctions including secondary sanctions u s sanctions policymakers have long contemplated or imposed sanctions unilaterally such as the longstanding u s embargo on cuba or the u s sanctions on iran and libya enacted in the 1990s however over the past several decades american officials have generally striven to act multilaterally either by obtaining u n security council sanctions such as those imposed in 2016 and 2017 on north korea or by developing coalitions of likeminded states to impose multilateral sanctions such as the joint u s e u sanctions imposed on russia in 2014 during this period policymakers have typically seen unilateral sanctions as a last resort option this was in part because of the potentially more limited financial impact but also because sanctions are designed to isolate their target that diplomatic impact can be eroded when sanctions can be more easily framed as an unwarranted aggression by a single hostile country in the last several years however the united states has shown a renewed willingness to deploy unilateral sanctions both aggressively and quickly the united states has not obtained any significant multilateral support for the sweeping round of russia sanctions that congress passed in 2017 no major country has joined the donald trump administration in reimposing sanctions on iran after the u s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa also known as the iran nuclear deal in may 2018 in the last several years the united states has shown a renewed willingness to deploy unilateral sanctions both aggressively and quickly the united states has also become increasingly willing to impose unilateral sanctions to combat political repression and human rights abuses the u s government has used its broad human rights sanctioning authority the global magnitsky act to designate officials and businesspeople in countries as diverse as honduras israel democratic republic of congo and saudi arabia the administration has also significantly intensified sanctions on the authoritarian venezuelan government of nicolás maduro the united states has recently used sanctions against treaty allies targeting two turkish officials over turkey s detention of an american pastor the trump administration also acted against ally saudi arabia in imposing sanctions on saudi arabian officials involved in the murder in turkey of journalist jamal khashoggi perhaps the most striking aspect of the shift over the past several years is that u s unilateral sanctions increasingly not only restrict business activities by u s companies or people but are intended to target thirdcountry companies and people as well also known as secondary sanctions in imposing sanctions on iran both during the 2010 2015 period and following president trump s withdrawal from the jcpoa in may 2018 for example the united states aggressively deployed the threat of secondary sanctions against european chinese and other companies that could conduct business with iran the policy intent was to ensure that companies withdrew from iran even if their governments continued to allow trade with iran and opposed u s policy toward iran another relevant example is the array of u s secondary sanctions on russia which deter foreign companies from engaging in certain business with the russian defense energy and financial sectors even where the businesses remain legal under domestic law in the jurisdictions in which they operate recent cases of unilateral u s secondary sanctions targeting russia and iran have shown that such sanctions can have significant economic effects iran s economy for example is already showing signs of strain while sanctions imposed against russian oligarch oleg deripaska and his companies in april 2018 have had significant business and market impacts however unilateral u s sanctions also trigger strong political opposition abroad as foreign governments generally see such sanctions as an illegitimate extraterritorial application of u s law several governments including a number of european governments strongly opposed to the trump administration s policy toward iran are actively developing tools to circumvent u s sanctions these tools will be difficult to develop in the short term but growing global political opposition to u s unilateral sanctions could have longer term economic and diplomatic repercussions trend 2 congress s growing role in sanctions implementation and management congress s current dispute with the trump administration over whether and how to increase u s sanctions on russia is simply the latest in a long line of disagreements between congress and the executive branch over the exercise of economic sanctions in 1986 for example a supermajority in congress enacted sanctions against the apartheid government of south africa over president ronald reagan s veto in 1998 many members of congress were sharply critical of president bill clinton s decision to waive provisions of the iran and libya sanctions act that had targeted foreign companies investing in oil and gas projects in iran clinton vetoed a new iran sanctions bill that congress passed shortly after he issued the waivers president barack obama regularly disagreed with congress over iran sanctions between 2010 and 2015 and congress passed a number of iran sanctions laws accommodating some but disregarding other concerns of the obama administration indeed a study of 104 sanctions bills introduced in congress between 1983 and 2014 found that the executive branch expressed at least some opposition to at least 76 of them this longstanding tension between congress and the executive branch about sanctions reflects a natural friction given that the constitution splits authority over foreign policy between the two over the years congress has been instrumental in enacting sanctions that serve policies with widespread public support such as the sanctions on apartheid south africa the sanctions on iran s oil exports in late 2011 and the 2017 u s sanctions on russia but a too tight congressional straightjacket on the executive branch in order to constrain approach to the implementation of sanctions bears the risk of turning one of america s few tools of coercive diplomacy into a poor tool to induce change by target countries the executive branch has long been charged with negotiating with foreign governments on behalf of the united states and then submitting overall agreements to congress rather than having to subject every individual piece of foreign policy to congress for approval heavy handed congressional oversight of sanctions could severely undermine the ability to reward policy change by for example russia venezuela or north korea with a reduction or removal of sanctions and could thereby undermine the power of sanctions to incentivize behavioral change congress has been instrumental in enacting sanctions that serve policies with widespread public support this risk may be heightened by congress s recent effort to play an expanded role in overseeing ongoing implementation of sanctions this trend was epitomized by provisions in the aggressive 2017 countering america s adversaries through sanctions act caatsa that require the president to submit any significant reduction in u s sanctions on russia including simply removing an individual person or company from u s russia sanctions lists to congress for review before the administration can implement the proposed action congress also gave itself a new level of involvement in imposing sanctions in the 2016 global magnitsky act the statute targets corruption and human rights abuses and essentially lets congressional committees nominate specific individuals and companies for sanctions this development raises important questions about the appropriate role for congress in identifying specific sanctions targets as opposed to setting general policy and parameters the role of congress in managing sanctions is not a recent development but has expanded greatly in recent years leading to stark disagreements with presidents of both parties on implementation win mcnamee getty images the role of congress in managing sanctions is not a recent development but has expanded greatly in recent years leading to stark disagreements with presidents of both parties on implementation win mcnamee getty images going forward congress should be restrained in its attempts to manage sanctions implementation the executive branch requires flexibility and discretion in implementing sanctions to ensure that it can adapt to changing circumstances such as when the government or a political figure targeted by sanctions changes its policy put another way the executive branch also requires a degree of flexibility in the lifting of sanctions to ensure that sanctions can be used as a carrot in diplomatic negotiations traditional congressional oversight of the executive branch s sanctions implementation through hearings the nominations process and other tools is always appropriate however congress should move cautiously in further expanding its role in the implementation of sanctions instead it should focus on its longstanding role in helping establish when and where the united states deploys sanctions and whether such decisions advance u s national interests trend 3 an increase in unintended consequences the last several years have seen an expansion in the type and complexity of u s sanctions in 2014 the united states established a new kind of sanctions designation by imposing sanctions on russia the targets of which are compiled in the sectoral sanctions identification list ssi list this new designation prohibits only certain types of financial activity with sanctioned companies rather than imposing a general restriction on all business in 2017 the u s administration expanded this transaction specific type of sanction to venezuela s government the united states has also created other new and innovative sanctions designations in recent years including the 2018 section 231 sanctions targeting russian defense sector companies and the state department s cuba restricted list in addition to developing these new forms of financial sanctions the united states has issued increasingly complex sanctions executive orders licenses and regulations to target along with the traditional asset freeze and travel ban a more diverse range of global industries u s sanctions regulators have also increased their direct engagement with and focus on non u s non financial companies such as energy and high tech companies the expanding complexity of u s sanctions statecraft has allowed the u s government to more precisely target financial measures at criminal actors and security threats and to narrowly target large global companies and enterprises where more sweeping sanctions could have yielded unacceptable collateral costs invariably the greater pliability and subtlety of new sanctions authorities serves the u s policy interest allowing for calibrated economic effects however this development has also raised a growing number of complex new challenges for the corporate compliance community it has accelerated a new era of significant increases in compliance costs across many businesses and has prompted many companies to weigh extremely carefully the risks of operating in jurisdictions that are semi sanctioned where sanctions risk is elevated but of uncertain and changing scope the imposition of sanctions on russian oligarch oleg deripaska right and his corporations played havoc with global aluminum markets underscoring how disruptive u s sanctions can be wang zhao pool getty images the imposition of sanctions on russian oligarch oleg deripaska right and his corporations played havoc with global aluminum markets underscoring how disruptive u s sanctions can be wang zhao pool getty images america s growing use of sanctions and its greater willingness to deploy them against economically significant targets have also triggered growing numbers of unintended consequences for example the april 2018 sanctions against russian oligarch deripaska and the companies he controls including aluminum giant rusal caused global aluminum prices to soar by more than 20 percent subsequently the treasury department issued licenses allowing continued business with rusal and in late 2018 announced plans to de sanction rusal and other deripaska linked companies after deripaska divested a portion of his shareholdings and ceded operational control of the companies similarly trump administration announcements in mid 2018 suggesting that iran s oil customers would need to reduce their purchases of iranian oil to zero by late 2018 briefly caused oil prices to spike before the administration softened its message signaling preparedness to moderate the rate of decline through the granting of significant reduction exemptions policymakers should invest greater resources in creating a dedicated and permanent sophisticated analytic capacity to estimate and weigh the intended and unintended impacts of sanctions continued intensive use of the diverse u s sanctions authorities in the future is likely to increase the challenges of complexity for u s companies and the risks of unintended consequences for companies foreign partners and u s policymakers for example several current proposals to increase sanctions on the russian energy sector if not carefully targeted could cause increases in global energy prices and have significant adverse impacts on major u s and european firms similarly increased u s use of economic statecraft measures against china whether due to disagreements over iran or north korea or to growing direct u s chinese tensions could have significant implications for global financial markets and supply chains if the united states is going to continue using sanctions as a preeminent foreign policy tool both executive branch and congressional policymakers should invest greater resources in creating a dedicated and permanent sophisticated analytic capacity to estimate and weigh the intended and unintended impacts of sanctions before their implementation the executive branch should also consider developing greater subject matter expertise in non financial sectors particularly energy and technology given the increasing impacts of u s sanctions on those areas of business greater u s government subject matter expertise will enable policymakers both to better target sanctions toward achieving desired outcomes and to avoid unintended collateral impacts finally the u s treasury department the primary sanctions implementation agency should consider creating a more structured forum for engagement with the private sector such as a formal advisory committee to improve dialogue with the private sector regarding compliance matters and sanctions effects trend 4 growing foreign government efforts to circumvent the u s financial system and u s sanctions foreign entities and individuals have long sought to evade american sanctions by keeping transactions outside of u s jurisdiction and conducting transactions through currencies other than the dollar foreign political leaders have complained about the u s dollar s dominance since its early days as the unrivaled global currency it was in the 1960s that then french finance minister valéry giscard d estaing coined the phrase exorbitant privilege while french president charles de gaulle complained about dollar dominance and withdrew france s u s dollar reserves in gold and repatriated them to france despite these periodic complaints however the dollar remains dominant by most measures it accounts for roughly 60 percent of global sovereign reserves approximately 40 percent of crossborder payments and likely over half of total global debt in addition to dollar dominance u s financial institutions and the u s branches of foreign financial institutions play an outsize role in the global financial system as a result foreign banks are generally loath to risk their access to the u s financial system even if only a small share of their business is denominated in dollars or directly touches the united states the trump administration s withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal and the ensuing reimposition of the full suite of u s sanctions on iran imperils european chinese and other countries companies doing business in the country chip somodevilla getty images the trump administration s withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal and the ensuing reimposition of the full suite of u s sanctions on iran imperils european chinese and other countries companies doing business in the country chip somodevilla getty images the twin dominance of the dollar and the u s financial system reflects the numerous advantages the u s dollar and financial system offer companies around the world that engage in global trade and finance these include liquidity stability convertibility and ease of use however the last several years have seen a substantial increase in foreign government initiatives to develop payment channels and other financial networks that do not touch the united states russia for example has established a financial messaging system that it bills as an alternative to the belgium based globally dominant payment messaging system society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift seeking participation by non russian companies in its new payment system china is also investing in establishing cross border payments systems and in increasing the role of the renminbi in international trade in one example china launched a renminbi denominated crude contract in 2017 to broaden use of its currency for this crucial economic input the european union has also announced the development of a special purpose vehicle spv to allow payments related to trade with iran despite u s sanctions all of these initiatives will face substantial challenges in achieving scale primarily because at present they offer inferior alternatives to a broadly accepted and stable financial architecture and there is no overwhelming economic demand as opposed to political demand for their development the renminbi has been the currency of only about 2 percent of total global trade in recent years despite china s stated interest in internationalizing the currency for certain purposes the european union is finding that few if any large european companies want to use its spv if doing so will expose them to u s sanctions where small european companies do manage to maintain limited economic activity with iran they already have banking relationships or netting arrangements and have no meaningful incentive to switch to the spv alternatives to the dollar or u s dominated cross border payments system do not need to displace the dollar to begin undermining u s coercive economic leverage but despite the challenges these efforts face u s policymakers should monitor the progress of such financial initiatives and should not underestimate the potential risks particularly over the longer term china s rapid expansion of its belt and road initiative and its recent move toward paying for some oil imports in renminbi could help the country accelerate international adoption of its currency sustained political and economic investments by european states and other governments in developing alternative payment channels or regional currency trading blocks that do not depend on the dollar may succeed in the long term in a world of secondary sanctions the real question is whether third country companies and banks in india for example can divorce themselves from the dollar and dependence on the u s financial system so that they will be inclined to participate in these alternatives and many will be reluctant to do so but ultimately alternatives to the dollar or u s dominated cross border payments system do not need to displace the dollar to begin undermining u s coercive economic leverage rather they need only to reach a significant enough scale that smaller and mid size economies that tend to be targets of u s sanctions such as iran and north korea can conduct sufficient trade using alternatives to blunt the impact of such sanctions trend 5 increasingly important role of technology finally rapidly moving technological changes are likely to affect the strength and utility of u s sanctions in the coming years several technological developments have the potential to enhance sanctions enforcement efforts for example the rapid expansion of publicly available satellite imaging capabilities over the past five years has already facilitated improved tracking of iranian oil shipments and detection of illicit north korean imports of oil and exports of coal and other natural resources regulated by u n sanctions additionally banks are able to use new software to better integrate financial data and public non financial data relevant to customers or transaction patters new sophisticated analytic tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are beginning to make it easier for banks and other large companies to identify and stop suspicious financial patterns linked to money laundering and sanctions evasion these analytic tools are also being deployed to create greater publicly available information about the front companies that sanctioned actors use and to improve reporting of types of evasion that both government enforcement officials and private sector companies should watch the nonprofit research group center for advanced defense studies c4ads for example has applied analytic tools to scour public corporate records databases and integrate them with other sources of public information to identify and publish reports on north korean sanctions evasion techniques as well as networks that have helped sanctioned entities continue to do business further advances in technology will strengthen these analytical tools particularly if government officials are able to break down current barriers to information sharing by the private sector among both banks inside the united states and those in the united states and foreign jurisdictions other technological changes however have the potential to facilitate sanctions evasion some of the potential evasion techniques are essentially modern day versions of tried and true criminal tactics north korea has long engaged in counterfeiting drug running and other criminal activities as a way of raising revenue for its dictatorial regime and it has smuggled bulk cash to evade sanctions today north korea is engaging in cyberattacks to steal cryptocurrencies as well as traditional fiat currencies it is also using cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions the uneven nature and sometimes very loose regulation of cryptocurrencies will likely continue to make them attractive to sanctioned actors for now however there is a limit to the scale of their use by sanctions evaders the volatility of most cryptocurrencies and the challenge and expense involved in anonymously converting them into hard assets or goods may limit the overall scale of cryptocurrency utility in sanctions evasion absent a dramatic expansion in their overall use u s sanctions policymakers have a strong interest in ensuring that the united states and u s companies lead the development of new financial technologies over the longer term however the bigger risk may be technological changes that alter the global financial architecture in ways that have more systemic impacts on u s sanctions for example over the last several decades the united states has derived significant coercive economic leverage from the primary role that u s financial institutions play in clearing global financial transactions as recent criminal indictments of north korean entities trying to access the u s financial system have shown it is difficult to engage in trade even trade that does not involve a u s party or u s origin goods without touching the u s financial system should blockchain based clearing mechanisms or other new technologies emerge at a scale that can allow transactions to avoid touching u s institutions or currency the united states may find that unilateral financial sanctions lose some of their bite as a consequence u s sanctions policymakers have a strong interest in ensuring that the united states and u s companies lead the development of such new technologies as a way of retaining leverage over the global financial system even if traditional dollar clearing becomes less dominant conclusion the trends highlighted in this report represent powerful determining factors in the future use of sanctions and the likely reach of sanctions as a tool of u s statecraft this report offers insights on when sanctions may confer leverage and when they may not going forward it also sheds light on some of the exogenous factors that will influence the strength and availability of sanctions these findings should be viewed as lessons for decisionmakers and analysts and weighed carefully to ensure that the united states preserves an effective tool for confronting some of the most profound threats challenging it and its allies today several recent public articles and reports have raised concerns that the intensive use or overuse of sanctions is hastening the demise of this tool of state furthermore several commentators have argued that the aggressive use of sanctions may fundamentally undermine u s economic strength bringing about an array of economic harms far beyond a loss of leverage to exercise sanctions it is important to carefully consider these issues while also recognizing the enduring economic and financial strengths of the united states the authors of this report believe that sanctions should and can continue to be a very strong and effective instrument of national power for many years to come the authors urge a careful and measured approach in the use of sanctions bearing these competing concerns in mind this report should strongly encourage policymakers to dedicate much more substantial economic legal and technological resources to tracking and assessing trends relevant to the development and use of sanctions its authors also see an important responsibility for the public to hold policy leaders accountable and to contribute to the thinking on this critical policy area as well the authors hope that the analysis in this brief will help to spur both policymaker and independent analysis on sanctions and will serve to directly contribute to the strengthening of the u s economy and national security about the cnas task force on the future of u s sanctions in june 2017 the center for a new american security cnas launched its task force on the future of u s sanctions consisting of former senior u s officials corporate representatives and academic and nonprofit experts it examined developments in specific sanctions programs such as those targeting north korea venezuela and iran emerging crosscutting themes such as the impact of technological changes on u s sanctions congressional executive branch relations regarding sanctions and trans atlantic cooperation on these measures during 2017 and 2018 the task force hosted a range of high level government officials and distinguished thought leaders task force members analyzed key trends in u s sanctions and global developments that could potentially affect u s sanctions and other coercive economic measures in the future this brief describes the five most important of those trends and offers concise summaries of issues that sanctions and national security policymakers should consider

from internal cash flows and yields an after tax npv8 of 10 0 billion and an irr of 41 all figures in the pfs and pea are on a 100 project basis once the expanded pea production rate of 18 mtpa is achieved kamoa kakula is projected to become the world s second largest copper mine with peak annual production of more than 700 000 tonnes of copper on january 30 2019 ivanhoe reported a 22 3 metre intersection of 13 05 copper at a 2 cutoff in a shallow flat lying discovery within 190 metres of surface at the kamoa north exploration area on the kamoa kakula mining licence the drill hole dd1450 is the thickest highest grade copper intersection drilled to date at kamoa kakula highlighting the potential for significant additional resource expansion additional drilling is underway to test the strike and width of the east west trending fault structure that hosts the bonanza grade copper in hole dd1450 nine holes now have been completed in the discovery area and assays are pending for eight of the holes based on visual interpretation of massive bornite and chalcopyrite in the recent drill intersections the new high grade zone of shallow thick flat lying copper mineralization has been extended over a strike length of at least 200 metres a width of up to 80 metres and drilled thickness of between 13 and 30 metres the new discovery zone is approximately 170 to 200 metres below surface discovery hole dd1450 is associated with an east west trending fault structure that allowed copper rich fluids to flow into the stratigraphy above the conventional kamoa kakula mineralized zone and into a pyrite rich siltstone zone called the kamoa pyritic siltstone kps the shallow depth remarkable thickness and massive copper mineralization in the kps discovery could prove extremely significant if targeted early from a future kamoa north decline the controlling east west striking fault responsible for the massive copper sulphide mineralization in the kps is visible on airborne magnetic images and can be traced over a distance length at least 10 to 20 kilometres it trends west of kamoa kakula for a considerable distance onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences that are 100 owned by ivanhoe mines additional rigs will be added to accelerate the drill testing of this mineralizing structure assays for the outstanding drill holes have been expedited and ivanhoeplans to provide an update on this important exploration program in the near future a second rig will be added to expedite the drill testing of this mineralizing structure kamoa kakula geologists also are exploring another zone of shallow high grade copper mineralization in the far northern region of the kamoa kakula mining licence this mineralized corridor trends north and south for more than nine kilometres before swinging to the northwest and is projected to continue onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences ivanhoe s drc exploration team is continuing with its regional drilling program targeting kamoa kakula style copper mineralization in the western foreland region just to the west of the kamoa kakula mining licence area on october 1 2018 ivanhoe announced the makoko copper discovery at western foreland makoko ivanhoe s third major copper discovery in the drc shows similar geological characteristics to the tier one kamoa kakula discoveries on july 30 2018 ivanhoe announced a new mineral resource estimate for the kipushi mine in the drc that increased zinc rich measured and indicated mineral resources by 16 from 10 2 million tonnes to 11 8 million tonnes the new estimate also increased kipushi s zinc grade from 34 89 to 35 34 in addition the mine s copper rich measured and indicated resources increased by 40 from 1 6 million tonnes to 2 3 million tonnes with a slight increase in the copper grade from 4 01 to 4 03 the updated mineral resource will be used in the preparation of the kipushi definitive feasibility study dfs which is expected in the first half of this year the dfs will update and refine the findings of the pfs issued in december 2017 similar to the pfs the dfs will focus on the initial mining of kipushi s big zinc zone the december 2017 pfs analyzed the plan to bring kipushi s big zinc zone into production in less than two years with a life of mine average annual production rate of 225 000 tonnes of zinc and cash costs of 0 48 per pound of zinc the planned return to production would establish kipushi as the world s highest grade major zinc mine discussions are continuing with potential strategic partners and lenders to support ivanhoe s continuing advance toward a new era of production at kipushi ivanhoe has made significant progress in upgrading the mine s underground infrastructure and the company now has a much clearer path to a resumption of production from the high grade big zinc orebody on october 8 2018 ivanhoe announced that the sinking of shaft 1 at the platreef palladium platinum nickel

largest zinc mines all figures are on a 100 project basis unless otherwise stated estimated life of mine average cash cost of 0 48 lb of zinc is expected to rank kipushi once in production in the bottom quartile of the cash cost curve for zinc producers internationally the planned primary mining method for the big zinc deposit in the pfs is sublevel long hole open stoping with cemented backfill the crown pillars are expected to be mined once adjacent stopes are backfilled using a pillar retreat mining method the big zinc deposit is expected to be accessed via the existing decline and without any significant new development the main levels are planned to be at 60 metre vertical intervals with sublevels at 30 metre intervals the kipushi project s definitive feasibility study is progressing and is expected to be completed in q2 2019 project development and infrastructure significant progress has been made in modernizing the kipushi mine s underground infrastructure as part of preparations for the mine to resume commercial production in q4 2018 the kipushi project successfully hoisted previously mined ore from shaft 5 to surface this was the first time that ore had been hoisted to surface since the mine was placed on care and maintenance by gécamines in 1993 earlier in 2018 the kipushi project successfully completed initial pre production testing as part of the equipment commissioning process for the new large capacity rock crusher that has been installed 1 150 metres below surface the sandvik jaw crusher has a maximum capacity of 1 085 tonnes an hour the 54 tonne machine was re assembled and installed in the crusher chamber after it was disassembled on surface and its pieces were lowered down shaft 5 which is the kipushi mine s main production shaft photo 7 kipushi s fully assembled sandvik jaw crusher capable of crushing up to 1 085 tonnes of ore an hour photo 8 construction of the rock load out facility on kipushi s 1 150 metre level ore from the big zinc deposit will be unloaded here for crushing and hoisting to surface ivanhoe completed the upgrading of a significant amount of underground infrastructure at the kipushi project including a series of vertical mine shafts to various depths with associated head frames as well as underground mine excavations and infrastructure a series of crosscuts and ventilation infrastructure still is in working condition and has been cleared of old materials and equipment to facilitate modern mechanized mining the underground infrastructure also includes a series of pumps to manage the influx of water into the mine and water levels are easily maintained at the bottom of the mine shaft 5 is eight metres in diameter and 1 240 metres deep it now has been upgraded and re commissioned the main personnel and material winder has been upgraded and modernized to meet international industry standards and safety criteria the shaft 5 rock hoisting winder now is fully operational with new rock skips new head and tail ropes and attachments installed the two newly manufactured rock conveyances skips and the supporting frames bridles have been installed in the shaft to facilitate the hoisting

the kakula deposit development of the twin access declines at the northern side of the kakula deposit started with the first blast on november 16 2017 at the end of 2018 each of the twin declines at kakula had been advanced more than 1 180 metres from the portal face toward the mineralized zone for a total advancement of 3 430 metres both declines currently are passing through the lower diamictite approaching the high grade mineralization construction of the 1 050 metre level dam and the two access drifts also were initiated in q4 2018 photo 15 preparing an explosive charge underground at kakula the main twin declines intersected the northern edge of the mineralized reef in january 2019 lateral underground mine development now is progressing toward the initial high grade mining area a system of through ventilation has been constructed with fresh air being pulled down the service decline and exhausted up the conveyor decline this will allow the project to increase the underground work force to four development crews and will enable fresh air to be pushed further into the mine than had been possible with forced vent ducts from surface a single decline also is being developed on the south side of the kakula deposit to provide bottom access to ventilation shaft 2 enabling this shaft to be constructed by raise boring instead of sinking this decline also will be used as a second means of egress from the mine photo 16 construction is underway on a third decline tunnel on the southern side of the kakula deposit to provide access and ventilation to the high grade copper the design for the main kakula decline conveyor system and initial two truck tips at the bottom of the decline is well advanced most of the major procurement packages had been ordered by the end of 2018 including steel fabrication conveyor drives idlers and apron feeders construction is expected to start in late march 2019 and it is scheduled to be operational by the end of 2019 this will reduce the truck traffic in the declines with consequent reduction in costs congestion and ventilation requirements the contract for raise boring of ventilation shaft 1 was awarded in november 2018 the shaft will be 5 5 metres in diameter and 200 metres deep figure 5 kakula 2019 pfs mine development plan prepared by stantec photo 17 contractors wiring up explosives for ventilation shaft 1 that will provide fresh air to kakula s underground workings exploration activities continue at kakula and kamoa north exploration drilling in q4 2018 was completed with eight contractor drill rigs and two company owned drill rigs the number of drill rigs was gradually reduced in december 2018 to allow for a shut down over the holiday period and for scheduled reduction in drilling for 2019 a total of 85 593 metres were drilled in 2018 from 272 diamond drill holes exploration drilling during q4 2018 was split between kakula and kamoa north with 21 198 metres drilled for exploration purposes in 58 holes the reduction from the previous quarter was due to geotechnical drilling for the decline and planned tailings storage facility site a total of 36 holes totalling 16 178 metres were completed in kamoa north in which two rigs were drilling shallow holes unprecedented exploration drilling results at kamoa north on january 30 2019 ivanhoe released assay results from ongoing exploration drilling at kamoa north assays for 22 holes were released the results included an unprecedented 22 3 metre intersection true thickness of 13 05 copper at a cut off of 2 copper in a shallow flat lying discovery at the kamoa north copper exploration area drill hole dd1450 includes multiple one metre intersections with copper grades higher than 20 copper including a 40 copper interval at a cut off of 5 copper dd1450 s intersection is 15 92 copper over 16 8 metres true thickness using a lower cut off grade of 1 copper the intersection is 10 29 copper over 29 4 metres true thickness

drill hole dd1450 at kamoa north beginning at a depth of only 190 metres below surface additional drilling is underway to test the strike and width of the east west trending fault structure that hosts the bonanza grade copper in hole dd1450 nine holes now have been completed in the discovery area and assays are pending for eight of the holes based on visual interpretation of massive bornite and chalcopyrite in the recent drill intersections the new high grade zone of shallow thick flat lying copper mineralization has been extended over a strike length of at least 200 metres a width of up to 80 metres and drilled thickness of between 13 and 30 metres the new discovery zone is approximately 170 to 200 metres below surface discovery hole dd1450 is associated with an east west trending fault structure that allowed copper rich fluids to flow into the stratigraphy above the conventional kamoa kakula mineralized zone and into a pyrite rich siltstone zone called the kamoa pyritic siltstone kps the shallow depth remarkable thickness and massive copper mineralization in the kps discovery could prove extremely significant if targeted early from a future kamoa north decline the controlling east west striking fault responsible for the massive copper sulphide mineralization in the kps is visible on airborne magnetic images and can be traced over a distance length at least 10 to 20 kilometres it trends west of kamoa kakula for a considerable distance onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences that are 100 owned by ivanhoe mines additional rigs will be added to accelerate the drill testing of this mineralizing structure assays for the outstanding drill holes have been expedited and ivanhoeplans to provide an update on this important exploration program in the near future kamoa kakula geologists also are exploring another zone of shallow high grade copper mineralization in the far northern region of the kamoa kakula mining licence this mineralized corridor trends north and south for more than nine kilometres before swinging to the northwest and is projected to continue onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences photo 19 david

station to supply clean electricity to the national grid ongoing upgrading work at the mwadingusha hydropower plant in the drc has significantly progressed with the major equipment being delivered on site the power station was shut down to replace sections of penstocks that were found to be in an advanced stage of corrosion the progressive re commissioning of the turbines fully refurbished and modernized with state of the art control and instrumentation will start in 2019 and be completed in q3 2020 the refurbished plant will deliver an output increased by 10 to a capacity of approximately 72 megawatts mw of power the work at mwadingusha part of a program to eventually overhaul and boost output from three hydropower plants is being conducted by engineering firm stucky of lausanne switzerland under the direction of ivanhoe mines and zijin mining in conjunction with the drc s state owned power company la société nationale d electricité snel once fully reconditioned the three plants will have a combined installed capacity of approximately 200 mw of electricity for the national grid which is expected to be more than sufficient for the kamoa kakula project the kansoko mine kakula mine and kamoa camp have been connected to the national hydroelectric power grid since the completion of a 12 kilometre 120 kilovolt dual circuit power line between kansoko and kakula in december 2017 the design of permanent 11 kilovolt reticulation to the vent shafts and mine has started which includes substations overhead lines and surface cables photo 20 construction has commenced on a 220 kilovolt electrical substation at the kakula mine that will allow the mine to be powered by clean sustainable hydro generated electricity from the country s national power grid photo 21 surveying and construction is underway on a new 20 kilometre by pass road linking the kamoa kakula project to the kolwezi airport located approximately six kilometres south of kolwezi when completed this new road will significantly improve the transportation corridor between kolwezi and kamoa kakula continued focus on community and sustainability the kamoa kakula sustainable livelihoods program is committed to sustainable development in the communities within the project s footprint the main objective of the livelihoods program is to enhance food security and the living standards of the people who reside within the project s footprint the program is mainly implemented through fish farming and food crops including farming of maize corn and vegetables plus poultry production and beekeeping additional non farming related activities for 2018 included education and literacy programs the completion of a community water program the continuation of the brick making program and the creation of unskilled job opportunities the resettlement and fencing for the 16 kilometre mine perimeter fence was completed in october 2018 a total of 45 households were successfully resettled in newly constructed houses in the muvunda village and a new school was constructed in muvunda photo 22 farmers weeding newly planted cabbage at one of the new community farms established near the kamoa

consolidated financial statements ivanhoe had no operating revenue in any financial reporting period and did not declare or pay any dividend or distribution in any financial reporting period table 1 discussion of results of operations review of the year ended december 31 2018 vs december 31 2017 the company recorded a total comprehensive loss of 13 6 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to a total comprehensive profit of 247 8 million for the year ended december 31 2017 the profit in 2017 was attributable mainly to the reversal of the impairment of mineral property and other items of the kipushi project of 286 3 million when excluding the 2017 reversal of impairment of 286 3 million the company s total comprehensive loss for the year ended december 31 2017 would have amounted to 38 5 million this is 24 9 million higher than the total comprehensive loss of 13 6 million for the same period in 2018 the decrease mainly was due to the company recording its share of a profit from the kamoa holding joint venture of 19 6 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to a loss of 27 5 million in 2017 the costs associated with mine development are capitalized as development costs in kamoa holding while the exploration expenditure is expensed capitalization of costs at kakula commenced during q2 2017 coinciding with the start of the kakula box cut expenditure attributable to exploration at kamoa north kakula west and in the saddle area between kakula west and kakula still was expensed in 2018 the interest expense in the kamoa holding joint venture relates to shareholder loans where each shareholder is required to fund kamoa holding in an amount equivalent to its proportionate shareholding interest the company is advancing crystal river s portion on its behalf in return for an increase in the promissory note due to ivanhoe with the kamoa kakula project quickly advancing towards production and as supported by the excellent economics in the recently completed pre feasibility study on kakula future taxable income now is deemed probable at the kamoa kakula project and the previously unrecognized deferred tax asset has been recognized by the kamoa holding joint venture as a result furthermore with revenue deemed probable the kamoa holding joint venture also has reversed the impairment of previously impaired vat receivables that will be available for set off once income tax is payable the company s total comprehensive loss included an exchange loss on translation of foreign operations of 33 0 million for the year ended december 31 2018 resulting from the weakening of the south african rand by 17 from december 31 2017 to december 31 2018 compared to an exchange gain on translation of foreign operations recognized in 2017 of 13 8 million exploration and project expenditure for the year ended december 31 2018 amounted to 11 5 million and was 29 0 million less than for the same period in 2017 40 5 million exploration and project expenditure for 2018 related solely to ivanhoe s 100 owned western foreland exploration licences while 36 7 million for 2017 related to the kipushi project finance income for the year ended december 31 2018 amounted to 49 9 million and was 17 2 million more than for the same period in 2017 32 6 million the increase mainly was due to interest earned on loans to the kamoa holding joint venture to fund operations that amounted to 40 4 million in 2018 and increased by 13 0 million as the accumulated loan balance increased financial position as at december 31 2018 vs december 31 2017 the company s total assets increased by 613 5 million from 1 271 3 million as at december 31 2017 to 1 884 8 million as at december 31 2018 the increase mainly was due to the proceeds received on completion of the equity investment by citic metal africa investments limited citic metal africa and zijin exercising its anti dilution rights for gross proceeds of 555 million and 60 million respectively cash and cash equivalents increased by 392 6 million the company utilized 14 7 million of its cash resources in its operations which includes interest of 7 1 million received during the year ended december 31 2018 the company s investment in the kamoa holding joint venture increased by 129 3 million from 552 4 million as at december 31 2017 to 681 7 million as at december 31 2018 with each of the current shareholders funding the operations equivalent to their proportionate shareholding interest the company s portion of the kamoa holding joint venture cash calls amounted to 69 3 million during 2018 while the company s share of comprehensive profit from the joint venture amounted to 19 6 million the net increase of property plant and equipment amounted to 96 4 million with a total of 127 9 million being spent on project development and to acquire other property plant and equipment of this total 59 9 million and 69 1 million pertained to development costs and other acquisitions of property plant and equipment at the platreef project and kipushi project respectively the main components of the additions to property plant and equipment including development costs at the platreef and kipushi projects for the year ended december 31 2018 and for the same period in 2017 are set out in the following table table 2 costs incurred at the kipushi project subsequent to the finalization of its pre feasibility study have been capitalized as property plant and equipment costs incurred at the platreef project are deemed necessary to bring the project to commercial production and are therefore also capitalized the company s total liabilities increased by 6 2 million to 66 0 million as at december 31 2018 from 59 8 million as at december 31 2017 the increase was mainly due to a 2 9 million increase in trade and other payables and a 2 0 million increase in borrowings resulting from un paid interest selected quarterly financial information the following table summarizes selected financial information for the prior eight quarters ivanhoe had no operating revenue in any financial reporting period and did not declare or pay any dividend or distribution in any financial reporting period table 3 review of the three months ended december 31 2018 vs 2017 the company recorded a total comprehensive profit of 28 4 million for q4 2018 compared to a profit of 285 3 million for the same period in 2017 the profit in 2017 was attributable mainly to the reversal of the impairment of mineral property and other items of the kipushi project of 286 3 million as described above while the profit in 2018 mainly was due to the company recording its share of a profit from the kamoa holding joint venture of 41 3 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to a loss of 10 2 million for the same period in 2017 finance income for q4 2018 amounted to 16 5 million and was 7 5 million more than for the same period in 2017 9 0 million the increase mainly was due to interest earned on loans to the kamoa holding joint venture to fund operations that increased by 3 6 million as the accumulated loan balance increased and increase in interest received on cash and cash equivalents due to a higher cash balance during q4 2018 the company s total comprehensive profit for q4 2018 included an exchange loss on translation of foreign operations of 9 1 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 resulting from the weakening of the south african rand from september 30 2018 to december 31 2018 compared to an exchange gain on translation of foreign operations recognized in q4 2017 of 12 4 million exploration and project expenditure for the three months ended december 31 2018 amounted to 4 9 million and was 6 1 million less than for the same period in 2017 11 0 million the decrease in exploration and project expenditure is attributable to the capitalization of costs incurred at the kipushi project that began following the finalization of its pfs in december 2017 with the focus at the kipushi and platreef projects being on development and the kamoa kakula project being accounted for as a joint venture the total 4 9 million exploration and project expenditure for the three months ended december 31 2018 related to exploration at ivanhoe s 100 owned western foreland exploration licences in q4 2017 8 3 million of the total 11 0 million exploration

resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors estimates of mineral reserves provide more certainty but still involve similar subjective judgments mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation including estimated future production from the company s projects the anticipated tonnages and grades that will be mined and the estimated level of recovery that will be realized which may prove to be unreliable and depend to a certain extent upon the analysis of drilling results and statistical inferences that ultimately may prove to be inaccurate mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates may have to be re estimated based on i fluctuations in copper nickel zinc platinum group elements pge gold or other mineral prices ii results of drilling iii metallurgical testing and other studies iv proposed mining operations including dilution v the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimates and or changes in mine plans vi the possible failure to receive required permits approvals and licences and vii changes in law or regulation forward looking statements and information

restructuring adjusted ebitda was 91 3 million or 23 2 of gross billings operational performance continuing operations for the quarter ended december 31 2018 gross billings were 52 4 million down 3 0 or 1 6 million driven by a 2 2 million decrease in the insights and loyalty solutions business to 42 4 million offset by a 0 7 million increase in the coalitions division the 2 2 million or 4 9

million of which 26 4 million was recorded in insights and loyalty solutions a 0 7 million increase in the coalitions revenue was offset by an 11 2 million decline in the insights and loyalty

against the fourth quarter of 2017 when a non recurring contingent consideration reversal of 4 million related to the air miles middle east business was recorded the increase in severance expense of 4 0 million and a 3 5 million increase in share based compensation charges also contributed to the increase in operating expenses before impairment charges lower revenue and higher operating expenses were the main drivers of the higher operating loss from continuing operations of 63 7 million adjusted ebitda in the quarter was 16 1 million compared to 8 2 million in 2017 mainly as the result of higher operating expenses total headcount was 1 486 at december 31 2018 down by around 25 compared to december 31 2017 as a result of business disposals and business transformation after accounting

of february 2019 free cash flow before dividends paid free cash flow before dividends paid was 17 1 million compared to 113 8 million in the prior year the variance is mainly explained by a decrease

operations was 12 8 million including capital expenditures of 1 8 million and restructuring payments of 0 9 million this compared to 25 0 million for the same period in the prior year with the 12 2

whatever it takes is a daunting legacy for any departing central bank chief to bequeath a successor and leaves world markets anxious about what is to come after mario draghi leaves the european central bank later this year draghi s 2012 pledge to save the euro won the confidence of financial markets and arrested the currency bloc s debt crisis investors admired his willingness to break new policy ground manoeuvring past internal and external opposition and clear communication of the ecb s thinking with growth and inflation flagging again and the ecb s policy arsenal depleted whoever succeeds him may need to be similarly bold growing questions about the orthodoxies of economic policy including monetary policy models could present an additional test mohamed el erian chief economic adviser for allianz se in california said replacing draghi if badly handled could create significant uncertainty at a time when the ecb faces slowing economic momentum add to that concern about the eroding effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies and the list of challenges facing the next ecb president gets quite significant said el erian a long time central bank observer big questions draghi nicknamed super mario looks set to end his eight year term without having ever executed a rate rise but after years of ultra easy monetary policy including negative interest rates and an unprecedented 2 6 trillion euro asset purchase scheme economic growth is weakening yet again inflation is below the ecb s near 2 percent target and germany s 10 year bond yield has dropped back below zero investors fear the ecb s window to normalise policy has closed meaning it has little in its toolkit to face the next recession like other central banks it is also struggling to explain why falling jobless rates have failed to lift inflation market expectations for which are at their lowest since 2016 after weak german data on friday exacerbated growth fears this raises big questions for the next ecb head to be appointed by politicians probably after the european parliament elections in may could a weak economy force a revival of quantitative easing qe with possible stock purchases given a scarcity of eligible bonds and to prevent a japanese style low inflation low growth rut the next ecb chief may have to mull unorthodox policy steps adopted by the bank of japan such as yield curve control the issue of having too few tools for the next slowdown is a challenge for all central banks but in the case of the ecb you could have a big political crisis to deal with as well as the more normal central banking day job said andrew balls global fixed income cio at pimco potential candidates for the job are already discussing these possibilities finnish central bank chief olli rehn seen as an outside tip said this month that the ecb should follow the u s federal reserve and review its entire policy framework given the failure to lift inflation after years of extraordinary stimulus inflation has been below the ecb s target since 2013 for francesco papadia former ecb head of market operations the balance sheet remains a key tool if further action is needed to shore up the economy the hefty asset purchases under draghi have doubled the ecb s balance sheet to 4 68 trillion euros the scarcity of some bonds could be dealt with the inventiveness the ecb has shown over the years for instance they could purchase bank loans or equities like the boj said papadia they could also come up with completely new tools consistent with their record of bold innovations economists polled by reuters favoured ecb board member benoit coeure to succeed draghi but saw finland s erkki liikanen as a more likely choice rehn german jens weidmann long a policy hawk to draghi s dove and france s francois villeroy de galhau are also potential candidates nobody can be more dovish than draghi whoever it is is going to be on the more hawkish end said giles rothbarth portfolio manager in blackrock s european equity team big shoes to fill few had predicted the ecb s change of speed after draghi took over from jean claude trichet in november 2011 with the debt crisis raging draghi had soon overridden northern european concerns about money printing draghi is big shoes to fill his whatever it takes speech is precisely what was needed at the time said bob michele head of global fixed income at jpmorgan asset management investors said the ability to communicate with markets and the boldness to fight a crisis were crucial qualities for a successor and that they valued stability more than asset performance during a central bank chief s tenure returns on the euro have fallen 17 percent during draghi s term while those on bank stocks are 1 percent lower the euro rallied 10 percent in the year after that july 2012 speech however while italy s 10 year bond yield dropped to around 4 percent from above 6 percent an analysis of introductory policy statements by ecb economists shows they generally became easier to read under draghi for former goldman sachs economist jim o neill draghi bank of england governor mark carney and fed chairman jerome powell represent a step forward as central bank heads because they have experience beyond academic circles all three worked at banks powell and carney have government experience while draghi later worked at the world bank whoever replaces mario i hope they are as open minded savvy and not too narrow minded economists said o neill high flux half the ecb board and more than a third of the rate setting governing council will be replaced this year richard barwell a former boe economist and head of macro research at bnp paribas asset management in london said the reality is the loss of an entire dream team that has driven the policy agenda coeure for example was a dynamic force in the ecb s market operations team that designs key crisis fighting tools belgian peter praet brought heavyweight power to the influential economics unit the succession will influence every decision for the next eight years said barwell source reuters reporting by dhara ranasinghe virginia furness helen reid and marc

rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a roughly flat opening on thursday following the volatility seen over the past few sessions lingering uncertainty may lead to choppy trading on wall street as traders weigh concerns about the economic outlook against reports of progress in u s china trade talks a senior u s administration official told reuters u s and chinese negotiators have made progress on the details of the written agreements to address u s concerns if you looked at the texts a month ago compared to today we have moved forward in all areas the official said but noted we aren t yet where we want to be the report comes as u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrive in beijing for a new round of high level talks with chinese officials optimism about the u s china trade talks may be offset by a report from the commerce department showing u s economic growth slowed by more than previously estimated in the fourth quarter stocks fluctuated over the course of the trading session on wednesday before ending the day mostly lower the choppy trading on the day partly reflected the volatility shown by the markets over the past several sessions the major averages eventually closed in negative territory but well off their worst levels of the day the dow edged down 32 14 points or 0 1 percent to 25 625 59 the nasdaq slid 48 15 points or 0 6 percent to 7 643 38 and the s p 500 fell 13 09 points or 0 5 percent to 2 805 37 the lower close on wall street came amid a notable drop by bond yields which extended the downward trend seen over the past few sessions the yield on the benchmark ten year note ended the day at its lowest closing level since december of 2017 bond yields have moved to the downside amid concerns about the economic outlook with an inversion of the yield curve leading to worries about a potential recession traders were also reacting to a report from the commerce department showing the u s trade deficit narrowed much more than expected in january due to a steep drop in the value of imports the commerce department said the trade deficit narrowed to 51 1 billion in january from a revised 59 9 billion in december economists had expected the deficit to shrink to 57 0 billion in the previous month the trade deficit increased to its highest level since reaching 60 2 billion in october of 2008 the narrower than expected deficit came as the value of imports tumbled by 2 6 percent to 258 5 billion while the value of exports rose by 0 9 percent to 207 3 billion michael pearce senior u s economist at capital economics noted the steep drop in the value of imports is hardly a positive sign for the economy nonetheless with imports now likely to have been flat or fallen slightly in the first quarter overall net trade is likely to be a positive for economic growth in the first quarter pearce said he added we now expect first quarter gdp growth to come in around 2 0 annualized up from

achieved kamoa kakula is projected to become the world s second largest copper mine with peak annual production of more than 700 000 tonnes of copper on january 30 2019 ivanhoe reported a 22 3 metre intersection of 13 05 copper at a 2 cutoff in a shallow flat lying discovery within 190 metres of surface at the kamoa north exploration area on the kamoa kakula mining licence the drill hole dd1450 is the thickest highest grade copper intersection drilled to date at kamoa kakula highlighting the potential for significant additional resource expansion additional drilling is underway to test the strike and width of the east west trending fault structure that hosts the bonanza grade copper in hole dd1450 nine holes now have been completed in the discovery area and assays are pending for eight of the holes based on visual interpretation of massive bornite and chalcopyrite in the recent drill intersections the new high grade zone of shallow thick flat lying copper mineralization has been extended over a strike length of at least 200 metres a width of up to 80 metres and drilled thickness of between 13 and 30 metres the new discovery zone is approximately 170 to 200 metres below surface discovery hole dd1450 is associated with an east west trending fault structure that allowed copper rich fluids to flow into the stratigraphy above the conventional kamoa kakula mineralized zone and into a pyrite rich siltstone zone called the kamoa pyritic siltstone kps the shallow depth remarkable thickness and massive copper mineralization in the kps discovery could prove extremely significant if targeted early from a future kamoa north decline the controlling east west striking fault responsible for the massive copper sulphide mineralization in the kps is visible on airborne magnetic images and can be traced over a distance length at least 10 to 20 kilometres it trends west of kamoa kakula for a considerable distance onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences that are 100 owned by ivanhoe mines additional rigs will be added to accelerate the drill testing of this mineralizing structure assays for the outstanding drill holes have been expedited and ivanhoeplans to provide an update on this important exploration program in the near future a second rig will be added to expedite the drill testing of this mineralizing structure kamoa kakula geologists also are exploring another zone of shallow high grade copper mineralization in the far northern region of the kamoa kakula mining licence this mineralized corridor trends north and south for more than nine kilometres before swinging to the northwest and is projected to continue onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences ivanhoe s drc exploration team is continuing with its regional drilling program targeting kamoa kakula style copper mineralization in the western foreland region just to the west of the kamoa kakula mining licence area on october 1 2018 ivanhoe

shareholders fiscal 2018 was an extraordinary year for team rh we generated record revenues in excess of 2 5 billion record gaap operating margin of 11 5 record adjusted operating margins of 12 1 and industry leading roic of 27 8 our focus on elevating the brand and architecting an integrated operating platform has resulted in our profit model leapfrogging past the home furnishings industry and rh becoming one of the few retailers that is expanding margins increasing operating earnings and driving significantly higher returns on invested capital we ve created separation by bringing truly innovative and disruptive strategies to life many of which are counter to those being pursued in the broader retail industry including designing an integrated ecosystem of products businesses and services that collectively amplify and render each other more valuable creating a truly unique customer experience that will be difficult if not impossible to replicate creating a global product development platform that attracts and amplifies the best designers artisans and manufacturers in the world controlling our collections from concept to customer rendering our products and brand more unique and valuable while affording us long term pricing power operating a highly efficient multi channel platform that enables customers to access our brand where and when they want with a single inventory and seamless experience moving from a promotional to a membership model elevating our brand and streamlining our business while developing a more intimate relationship with our customers pivoting the brand from creating and selling products to conceptualizing and selling spaces by building the largest residential interior design firm in north america opening architecturally inspiring and immersive physical experiences that render our products and services more unique and valuable while doubling our retail revenues and earnings in every market developing a dynamic and seamlessly integrated hospitality business that activates all of the senses drives tremendous traffic into our galleries and generates incremental revenues and earnings for our brand architecting a real estate development model that decreases occupancy costs and capital requirements while increasing earnings and returns on invested capital building an integrated operating platform that is enhancing the customer experience while reducing costs and increasing returns on invested inventory redesigning our organization to break down the silos and bureaucracy that build up as businesses grow resulting in improved focus and collaboration and increased accountability and decision speed while proud of what we ve accomplished and how we ve redefined our business and brand it s the potential to redefine our industry and create new markets that continues to drive us our future opportunity is based on our belief that there are those with taste and no scale and those with scale and no taste and the belief that the idea of scaling taste is large and far reaching we see an unlimited opportunity to create value by leveraging our unique taste and scale to create large and lucrative global markets across retail interior design hospitality residential and commercial development we also believe we have to think until it hurts until we can see what others can t see so we can do what others can t do the separation we ve created in our market reflects the efforts of a team of people who have thought deeply for decades about the brand we are building and the opportunities we carefully choose to pursue a team that understands that great brands are built based on a long term view and willingness to make the investments that lead to innovation and value creation the path we ve chosen while at times in conflict with current thinking and conventional wisdom has proven to be significantly more right than wrong and oftentimes shapes new paradigms as an example the simplifying assumption that digital was more profitable than physical and online furniture businesses should somehow be confused with technology companies may prove to be misplaced as digital brands rush to build physical stores in search of growth and profitability speaking of profitability which is surprisingly absent in the narrative of most retail businesses that are birthed online we believe what many have overlooked is that the cost of marketing an invisible store is proving to be more expensive than physical experiences while it s certainly in vogue to launch a retail business online the numbers do not reflect that it is more capital efficient and surely not more profitable we believe the past ten years will be looked back upon as the lost decade of retail a period where many brands have proclaimed a consultant coined digital first strategy allocating the vast majority of their capital towards building unnecessary and complex omni channel capabilities while leaving their retail stores to rot it should not be a surprise that the vast majority have simply shifted business from offline to online with increased costs and free shipping destroying their operating margins we will instead follow our own unique path one led by our vision and values and an obsession for building a brand with no peer we will sharpen our focus on elevating versus expanding pursue quality over quantity and prioritize innovation over duplication we will continue as we recently did in new york bringing architecturally inspiring immersive and profit generating brand experiences to life that create emotional physical connections in a world moving toward social digital connections btw rh new york is already trending in excess of 100 million in annualized revenue on team rh we say leaders have to be comfortable making others uncomfortable we believe leadership is about pursuing a vision something you ve never seen that s somewhere you ve never been as creatures of habit change is uncomfortable for humans but for the people of team rh a culture of leadership and innovation is at the core of who we are and reflected in everything we do we ve grown comfortable making ourselves and others uncomfortable for nearly two decades and hope to continue for the foreseeable future it s what leaders do and how we know we re on the right path it s why you should count on us to take the road less traveled and make the long term decisions that we believe will continue to inspire our customers and generate the highest returns in our industry for years to come 18 years ago we began this journey with a vision of transforming a nearly bankrupt business that had a 20 million market cap and a box of oxydol laundry detergent on the cover of its catalog into the leading luxury home brand in the world the lessons and learnings the insights and the intricacies the sacrifices you make and scar tissue that you develop by getting knocked down 10 times and getting up 11 leads to the development of the mental and moral qualities that build character in individuals and form cultures in organizations lessons that can t be learned in a classroom or by managing a business but must be earned by building a brand if you re inspired by what we ve achieved over the past 18 years just imagine what we will accomplish in the next 18 we like to say we re looking for a few good people who don t know what can t be done if you re one of those people we invite you to continue reading or better yet come join our cause fiscal 2018 highlights continued focus on execution architecture and cash as we completed our second year focused on executing a new business model architecting a new operating platform and maximizing cash flow by increasing revenues and earnings while decreasing inventory and capital spending our results are demonstrating that we are building a disruptive brand and business to gain profitable market share for years to come our record fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results demonstrate the strength of the rh brand the power of our new business model our focus on managing the business with a bias for earnings versus revenue growth and our continued success revolutionizing physical retailing we raised our guidance for the fourth quarter after the close of market on december 3rd despite the severe stock market volatility that occurred through the rest of the month with the dow dropping 799 points on december 4th on its way to losing over 4 000 points making it the worst december for stocks since the great depression we exceeded our guidance for adjusted operating margins adjusted operating income and adjusted net income our core rh business which has historically tracked to stock market fluctuations experienced a sales decline of approximately 10 points beginning the third week of december which persisted through the remainder of the fourth quarter leading to a 13 million shortfall to the mid point of our revised revenue guidance in december on a comparable 52 week basis adjusted net revenues increased 5 to 2 51 billion adjusted gross margins expanded 500 basis points to 40 1 and adjusted operating margins increased 510 basis points to 12 1 we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of 8 54 in fiscal 2018 driven by the significant growth in operating earnings coupled with a lower adjusted effective tax rate of 16 9 primarily as a result of tax benefits associated with the exercise of associate stock options and vesting of associate restricted stock units as well as a lower share count resulting from share repurchases fiscal 2018 free cash flow of 163 million fell short of our expectations largely as a result of the lower revenues and higher inventories due to softer sales and receipt timing plus the 50 60 million in assets sales we anticipated closing during the quarter the timing of which were also impacted by the market volatility we are currently reviewing multiple offers for our yountville property at attractive cap rates and expect to finalize the sale in the first half of this year in addition we are now being advised to maximize the sale price of our edina gallery by holding off on accepting offers for the property until the gallery opens this fall which means the transaction would close in the second half of 2019 merchandise inventories increased slightly to 532 million as a result of lower sales during the quarter and an acceleration of receipts from the first quarter to the fourth quarter as vendors accelerated shipments ahead of chinese new year and potential increase in tariffs as we did in fiscal 2017 we continued to hold ourselves back from adding new businesses in fiscal 2018 outside of ongoing investments in rh hospitality as we remained focused on optimizing the profitability of our new operating platform while most in our industry are closing or downsizing stores we remain committed to our quest of revolutionizing physical retailing we have proven our ability to double the retail sales in our markets with legacy stores while more than doubling our profitability our progress in fiscal 2018 included the opening of rh portland and rh nashville in the first half of the year and the opening of two very unique and diverse retail experiences rh new york and rh yountville in september we continue to be pleased with the performance of our new galleries and now have six galleries with our integrated hospitality experience rh new york continues to outperform despite the ongoing street construction in the meatpacking district and is now trending at an annualized revenue run rate in excess of 100 million we expect gallery sales to further accelerate throughout the year as street construction is completed and new luxury tenants begin to fill in the empty storefronts our efforts architecting a new operating platform inclusive of our distribution center network redesign the redesign of our reverse logistics and outlet business and the reconceptualization of our home delivery and customer experience is driving lower costs and inventory levels and higher earnings and inventory turns looking forward we expect this multi year effort to result in a dramatically improved customer experience continued margin enhancement and significant cost savings over the next several years moderating preliminary fiscal 2019 outlook due to the continued weakness in our core business post the fourth quarter market volatility the negative trends in the high end housing market and our continued efforts to edit unprofitable and non strategic businesses we are moderating our fiscal 2019 net revenue outlook to 2 585 billion to 2 635 billion representing growth of 3 to 5 the 6 point reduction at the midpoint from our prior preliminary guidance is the result of a 3 point reduction due to the market volatility and negative trends in high end housing plus a 3 point reduction as a result of editing unprofitable and non strategic businesses namely the elimination of the remaining holiday business 1 point the elimination of fringe promotions 1 point and the transition of our rug business from a single source importer to a direct sourcing model 1 point despite the lower sales outlook for fiscal 2019 our adjusted operating margin outlook is only moderating slightly given the power of our operating model and the editing of the unprofitable and non strategic businesses excluding adjustments for the new asc 842 lease accounting adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019 we are expecting adjusted operating margins in the range of 12 7 to 13 3 up 90 basis points at the midpoint versus 12 1 in 2018 and slightly lower than our prior guidance of 13 0 to 14 0 the new lease accounting is expected to have approximately an 70 basis point impact on our adjusted operating margins and 40 basis point impact on our adjusted net income margin our updated fiscal 2019 outlook excluding adjustments for the new asc 842 lease accounting is as follows adjusted net revenues in the range of 2 585 to 2 635 billion an increase of 3 to 5 adjusted operating margins in the range of 12 7 to 13 3 adjusted net income in the range of 213 to 230 million representing a 7 to 16 increase on a normalized 26 income tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of 8 41 to 9 08 representing an 11 to 19 increase on a normalized 26 income tax rate in fiscal 2018 and 2019 we have several new brand extension plans in our development pipeline we are launching rh beach house with a dedicated source book this spring and now plan to launch rh ski house with a dedicated source book this fall we are electing to swap the introduction of rh ski house with rh color which we are moving to next year in order to present the two second home concepts in a more logical progression additionally we have plans to elevate and expand our assortments in key categories with the introduction of new bespoke collections as we pivot back to growth over the next several years we also plan to increase our investment in rh interior design as we continue building the leading interior design firm in north america we believe there is a significant revenue opportunity by offering world class design and installation services as we move the brand beyond creating and selling products to conceptualizing and selling spaces as previously mentioned our plan is to accelerate our real estate transformation opening 5 to 7 new galleries per year up from 3 to 5 per year in the second half of fiscal 2019 we are planning to open 5 new galleries including edina mn charlotte nc corte madera ca san francisco ca and columbus oh all with our integrated hospitality offering due to the continued construction on gansevoort street we have chosen to delay the opening of the the new york guesthouse until spring of 2020 with the ongoing development of rh hospitality we are demonstrating that we can execute a profitable high quality food and beverage experience across multiple markets while driving traffic into our galleries that result in incremental revenues in our core business while we still expect an approximate 50 basis point drag on our operating margins due to the initial start up costs in fiscal 2019 we believe rh hospitality is now a proven scalable business and our plan is to increase the number of new galleries with integrated restaurants wine vaults and barista bars going forward in regards to waterworks you ll notice in our financial tables we took a further impairment on the business in the fourth quarter while the acquisition has been financially disappointing causing a 70 basis point drag to our operating margins we plan to take aggressive steps to refocus and return the business to double digit adjusted ebitda margins and still believe in the potential long term synergies and value creation turning to our balance sheet our capital structure and internally generated cash flow provides us with the flexibility to repay the outstanding principal of our 350 million june 2019 zero coupon convertible notes at maturity in cash as a reminder we purchased a bond hedge that is designed to protect us against dilution on the 2019 notes up to 171 98 per share to ensure financial flexibility and optionality we completed a zero coupon 335 million convertible notes offering in june 2018 with a conversion price of 193 65 that matures in june 2023 with a corresponding bond hedge designed to protect against dilution up to 309 84 per share we also repurchased 886 700 shares in the quarter at an average price of 118 20 for a total of 2 05 million shares at an average price of 122 08 under our 2018 700 million share repurchased authorization including our 1 billion 2017 repurchase of 20 2 million shares at an average price of 49 46 we have repurchased a total of 22 27 million shares at an average price of 56 13 for a total of 1 25 billion reiterating long term targets we remain confident in our long term targets as the earnings power and capital efficiency of our new model continues to evolve and we return to our product and brand expansion strategy in addition we have made improvements to our real estate development model and continue to reduce capital requirements for future galleries by improving deal economics and lowering construction costs while all of our new galleries scheduled to open in fiscal 2019 are under construction we were able to lower capital requirements for three of the five new galleries planned for next year and the vast majority of future projects as a reminder our long term targets are as follows net revenue growth of 8 to 12 annually adjusted operating margins in the mid to high teens adjusted earnings growth of 15 to 20 annually return on invested capital roic in excess of 50 we continue to see a clear path to 4 to 5 billion in north american revenues and an international opportunity that could lead to rh becoming a 7 to 10 billion dollar global brand we are currently exploring opportunities for bespoke design galleries in london paris and other parts of europe and believe there is tremendous opportunity for the rh brand to expand globally building a brand with no peer and a customer experience that cannot be replicated online we do understand that the strategies we are pursuing opening the largest specialty retail experiences in our industry while most are shrinking the size of their retail footprint or closing stores moving from a promotional to a membership model while others are increasing promotions positioning their brands around price versus product continuing to mail inspiring source books while many are eliminating catalogs and refusing to follow the herd in self promotion on social media instead allowing our brand to be defined by the taste design and quality of the products and experiences we are creating are all in direct conflict with conventional wisdom and the plans being pursued by many in our industry we believe when you step back and consider one we are building a brand with no peer two we are creating a customer experience that cannot be replicated online and three we have total control of our brand from concept to customer you realize what we are building is extremely rare in today s retail landscape and we would argue will also prove to be equally valuable we want to thank all of our people and partners whose passion and persistence bring our vision and values to life each and every day as we pursue our quest to become one of the most admired brands in the world carpe diem gary gary friedman

by robert murphy both fans and foes of the so called green new deal gnd agree that it is a wildly ambitious set of proposals which by design will involve the federal government spending boatloads of money in fact the gnd is so expensive that rep ocasio cortez has cited the inflationary doctrine of modern monetary theory mmt to deflect the issue we don t need to worry about the cost of the green new deal so the argument goes because the federal reserve can create an unlimited number of dollars even so more sober minded policymakers as well as the general public should be aware of just how ludicrously expensive the gnd really is a recent analysis by the american action forum puts the initial 10 year cost at a staggering 93 trillion although the reader might understandably assume that this is an inflated figure designed to discredit the gnd it actually rests on a few conservative assumptions the figure of 93 trillion is admittedly absurd but that s only because the planks of the gnd are absurdly expensive the american action forum estimate is entirely fair the major components of the green new deal the american action forum is headed by douglas holtz eakin who among other positions was the director of the congressional budget office cbo from 2003 to 2005 one can of course disagree with his team s analysis but their approach to budget scoring the gnd is entirely conventional in dc circles for their analysis the aaf team focused on six major planks of the gnd that they considered tractable for quantification the table below summarized the various cost estimates for each of the six items notice that there are many items listed in the gnd documentation that are not included in the table above this is one reason that i have called their cost estimate conservative another important point is that the absurd 93 trillion figure is not driven by one particular modeling choice on the contrary five of the six components studied by the team have a 10 year cost exceeding 1 trillion so even if it turns out that say the aaf team is totally wrong on the cost of universal health care and guaranteed green housing then the cost would still exceed 50 trillion for the first decade because of the other components elements of green new deal redundant the aaf analysis points out something that i haven t seen others stress some of the components of the green new deal are oddly redundant as the authors explain for example a costly retrofitting of every structure in the united states seems considerably less environmentally beneficial once the electricity grid is completely transformed to use 100 percent clean energy than it would be if undertaken with today s energy mix such a retrofit would have no impact on emissions similarly the gnd promises to ensure that every person has a guaranteed job a family sustaining rate of pay and benefits such as paid leave and paid vacations if everyone has good pay with good benefits why is it simultaneously necessary to provide targeted programs for food housing and health care some of these objectives appear to be redundant american action forum bold added in my view the particular observation i put in bold is especially poignant it shows just how shallow the thinking of the green new deal proponents really is what i think clearly happened here is this it is standard in the fight against climate change to agitate for energy efficient buildings which have for example well insulated windows to reduce heating and air conditioning expenses in the context of our current grid where most electricity comes from coal and natural gas this makes sense at the same time climate activists have been clamoring for subsidies mandates and taxes in order to force the grid to rely more heavily on wind and solar therefore since i claim the green new deal is simply a wish list of standard progressive social goals rather than an actual blueprint for fighting the technical problem of alleged human caused harmful climate change it shouldn t surprise us that both of these long standing goals namely refitting buildings and pushing the grid to zero emissions are featured prominently in the green new deal yet as the aaf authors explain in the block quotation above this doesn t really make any sense if the electrical grid doesn t emit any greenhouse gases then there s no reason to retrofit every building in america you would think the proponents of the gnd would be overjoyed to hear this but i m guessing they won t drop their plans for trillions of dollars in construction work being shoveled to unions explaining the estimate of converting the grid in the remainder of this article i ll run through two of the calculations by which the aaf team arrived at their enormous estimates first consider the move to a zero emission grid this is the opening of their analysis of this component we estimate that to transition to a power sector that has net zero emissions of greenhouse gases in 10 years would require a capital investment of 5 4 trillion by 2029 in addition the annual operation maintenance and capital recovery costs would be 387 billion we consider this estimate to be conservative in two respects first we assume that a low carbon electricity grid is feasible with only 4 hours of storage available for renewable resources academic estimates have said a reliable grid requires 12 hours second we assume no new construction of transmission assets is required even though efficiently siting new renewable assets will require significant transmission infrastructure american action forum endnotes omitted in addition their analysis is also very conservative because they assume that states without nuclear moratoriums build approximately 50 percent of their needed capacity with nuclear power but as i explained in my earlier ier critique of the green new deal they have clarified that their plan does not involve an expansion of nuclear also although the aaf analysis gives an estimate that electric bills will rise by 22 percent in the scenario they study a glance at the original table shows that this cost to households in the form of higher electricity prices is not included in the headline estimates in other words when the quoted cost of 5 4 trillion is just capturing the out of pocket expenditure necessary to build the new plants to replace the capacity currently provided by coal and natural gas fired plants the figure does not include the opportunity cost to the economy as a whole from relying on less convenient forms of energy making energy more expensive for families and businesses costs a lot not just conventionally in the form of foregone opportunities but also in social discord owing to government mandated energy price increases the ongoing weekly riots in paris initiated by opposition to a modest carbon tax illustrate the phenomenon explaining the job guarantee cost estimate in this final section i ll explain the aaf estimate of the cost of the federal job guarantee here is the relevant table here the calculations are pretty mechanical and this is why they re also very conservative as i will eventually explain the calculations assume that the federal government as part of the green new deal offers jobs paying at least 473 per week and 625 per week on average now then if we first ask how many people would normally be unemployed according to the standard u 6 measure and then we want to instead limit that unemployment rate to 1 5 we come up with the figure of 547 billion in the year 2019 specifically the aaf authors assume that the average outlay per job is 56 000 a figure derived from a pro job guarantee study published by the center on budget and policy priorities then using the number of unemployed according to the u 6 measure which includes those who are part time for economic reasons in january 2019 they calculate that a little under 9 8 million americans would need to be given a federal job in order to reduce the u 6 unemployment rate down to 1 5 the cost thus works out to the 547 billion expenditure shown in the first row of the table the second calculation includes not just the officially unemployed and those who are working part time for economic reasons i e the u 6 measure but also includes the fact that the labor force participation rate lfpr would presumably increase if a federal job paying at least 473 per week were now on the table since more people would have come into the labor force it presumably would cost the government more money to maintain the official u 6 unemployment rate at 1 5 and hence the cost jumps to 598 billion in 2019 and so on in the next two lines the study includes the consideration that many people who are currently working full time might quit their current jobs and try to receive the federally guaranteed jobs which pay to reiterate at least 473 per week and pay 625 on average naturally if we assume that people with current jobs start switching over the cost explodes leading to the enormous estimates shown in the table yet there is another consideration that the study s authors haven t included as millions of people become employed by the federal government doing busy work and yet getting paid an average of 625 per week it will necessarily be the case that the living standards of everyone else on average go down for example if a million people go from being unemployed to earning collectively 625 million per week then they will naturally consume much more than they used to but these million people are obviously not going to be producing 625 million in additional output boosting total gdp by that same increment if they could do that then the federal government wouldn t have needed to hire them private companies would have done so so if these million people are now consuming much more than they used to but their newly offered labor because before they were unemployed isn t itself producing the goods and services being purchased then it must be the case that other people s paychecks aren t going as far as they used to the specific way this outcome will manifest itself would depend on how the green new deal is financed but it would probably be a combination of a the other workers having smaller after tax incomes because taxes have gone way up to finance the green new deal b interest rates have risen to finance the higher deficits and c the prices of the goods they buy have gone up more than their paychecks because of the extra inflation from the fed needed to help finance the gnd yet in this environment with the federal government offering a guaranteed job with a floor salary more and more workers will quit their original jobs and take the federal one depending on the numbers a vicious spiral could develop in which more people flock to the guaranteed federal job whose wages are ultimately paid for by the ever shrinking remnant of workers in the genuine private sector to use a biological metaphor if a parasite grows too rapidly it could end up killing the host and thus its own source of sustenance conclusion the green new deal contains a wish list of progressive social and economic goals that come with a staggering price tag a recent estimate from the american action forum puts the 10 year cost at an incredible 93 trillion yet as we have explained above this estimate is conservative because it leaves out many practical considerations it s difficult to be precise however because the plan s authors have been deliberately vague on the details in reality the congress will not be so foolish as to attempt an undertaking so ludicrously expensive yet even if they implement a green new deal lite the package would still add many trillions in government debt while making energy and transportation more expensive for american households and businesses this was originally posted on mises org like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here
the euro area creating a stronger economic ecosystem as prepared for delivery introduction mesdames et messieurs bonjour i would like to thank governor villeroy de galhau for the kind introduction i would also like to thank banque de france and the european money and finance forum for inviting me to this important event as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the euro and as we think about thenext 20 years it is fitting that we should honor the courage creativity and perseverance of those who inspired this unique european project that spirit reminds me of a story that was once told by a great friend of europe president john f kennedy addressing students at uc berkeley in 1962 he said the following the great french marshall lyautey once asked his gardener to plant a tree the gardener objected that the tree was slow growing and would not reach maturity for 100 years the marshall replied in that case there is no time to lose plant it this afternoon twenty years ago european countries did not just plant one tree they planted an entire forest creating a new economic ecosystem known as the euro area the fundamental strength of that system lies in its interconnectedness and diversity a combination that can help europe to fully unlock its immense economic potential with its 19 member countries the currency union represents the world s second largest economy the euro is the world s second most traded currency making it an important reserve asset for other countries central banks and financial institutions above all the single currency has played a central role in boosting european integration which in turn has raised living standards across the continent real gdp per person in the euro area has increased by more than 60 percent over the past two decades it is not surprising therefore to see strong public support for the single currency three in five euro area residents say that the euro is good for their country and three quarters say that the euro is good for the european union and yet this is still a relatively young and incomplete ecosystem it braved a massive storm during the global financial crisis and another a short while later in the euro area sovereign debt crisis these events left painful economic scars on many households and companies sowing the seeds of economic disparity across member countries and within today one in four young people in the euro area is at risk of being in poverty casting a dark shadow over the continent s next generation a related challenge is the rise of populist movements in several countries calling into question the very idea of european integration like any ecosystem europe continues to face good times and bad after a formidable run of relatively strong growth over the last few years economic activity in the euro area is now once again slowing and risks are rising in many ways the weaker economic outlook raises an important question is the euro area better prepared for unexpected economic storms the short answer is yes the currency union is more resilient than ten years ago but it is not resilient enough its banking system is safer but not safe enough its economic well being is greater overall but the benefits of growth are not shared enough in other words now is the time to strengthen this unique economic ecosystem how by improving financial interconnectedness in a way that truly serves all europeans the current state of the financial system the relative success of the single market in goods and services in increasing economic integration serves as a reminder of the failure to achieve a similar degree of financial integration there once was a vision that monetary union would serve as the foundation of a financial union that just as there is a single market in goods and services there would eventually be a single market in banking and non bank finance as well we all recognize that finance is the lifeblood of commerce at its best it waters the seeds of innovation and facilitates the churning that every healthy ecosystem needs at its worst it becomes a deluge that sweeps away all that stands in its path we saw this during the global financial crisis and somewhere in the middle finance can simply be an underdeveloped irrigation system delivering some nutrients but not enough something that prevents the green shoots of growth from reaching their full potential i would put europe s financial system in this middle category unfortunately political priorities seem to have moved to other areas i for one do not view this as acceptable with the economic slowdown on everyone s minds let me say this clearly now is the time to give euro area finance another big push so today i will focus on the areas of financial integration where making progress is critical the banking union and the capital markets union pushing forward on banking union let me start with the banking union before the crisis financial integration in the euro area saw plenty of cross border lending especially between banks but it was also a time of national supervision and neglect of proper underwriting standards especially if the risks were far from home inevitably what followed were sharp rises in asset prices in some countries creating housing bubbles and fiscal bubbles we know how that ended when the global financial crisis hit the large so called core banks abruptly pulled their liquidity back to the perceived safety of home precipitating credit crunches where once they had fueled credit booms asset prices collapsed this retrenchment was an important contributor to the emergence of the euro area debt crisis just a few years later today cross border lending between banks in the euro area is back at 2005 levels so should we be worried yes firms in some euro area countries pay more than twice as much for credit than comparable firms in other euro area countries there is a similar situation for households and this dispersion in borrowing costs has increased since 2009 it is the cost of fragmentation in finance now it is not that nothing has been done to address the problem far from it in the midst of the crisis policymakers recognized that the institutional architecture the plumbing system had not held up to the storms they realized that to be strong and to thrive a monetary union needs a banking union one where risk taking is subject to proper checks and balances astounding progress was made in a very short amount of time the creation of a single supervisor for banks higher capital buffers inside banks the introduction of a new framework for handling bank failures and crises these new tools became critical elements of a new system of checks and balances the good news for taxpayers is that as a result they are now less likely to be on the hook for massive bank bailouts than a decade ago but that is not the whole story not only is home bias still pervasive in european banking as banks choose to lend and invest domestically but banks are facing new challenges from new angles higher capital at banks has meant lower returns on equity implying a need to pursue leaner and more efficient business models new entrants such as fintech firms mean new sources of competition bringing new pressures on bank profitability and if not carefully managed new incentives to ease lending standards in sum we need a european banking system that can bend in a storm without breaking we need a banking system that will truly diversify risks across the ecosystem and irrigate growth it is clear what is left to be done establish common deposit insurance we can find ways to resolve our legitimate national concerns and plant that vital shade tree i want to emphasize that this system will be funded by banks not taxpayers to get this done member countries will need to agree on a mutually acceptable balance between risk sharing and risk reduction between trust and accountability this will not be easy but today i urge euro area leaders to reignite the discussion to negotiate in good faith and make the difficult compromises to unlock the full potential of the banking union unlocking the potential of capital markets in parallel we have to pursue the essential complement to the banking union a thriving and integrated single european capital market just as a forest ecosystem is made more resilient by greater diversity so europe s financial system would be more resilient with more diversified sources of financing let me give you just one data point in the united states the corporate bond market accounts for more than two fifths of gdp compared with only one tenth in the euro area former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan once referred to capital markets as the spare tire of the financial system european finance also needs a spare tire this is why europe has chosen to chart a course to capital markets union this major endeavor like the banking union is ultimately about broadening the range of domestic and cross border financing options for firms and households why should people care currently euro area households store 40 percent of their financial assets as bank deposits this leaves them very exposed to the banking sector as long as this is the case europe will be overly reliant on banks for savings instruments and investment financing not only would an integrated capital market across the eu help companies and households reduce their reliance on banks it would also make the ecosystem more resilient to shocks it would help achieve a more uniform cost of funding for firms across countries think of similar firms in italy and austria just across the border from each other why should they face sharply different costs of financing when they are just a few kilometers apart it would also help boost people s returns on savings and help buffer domestic shocks to their incomes as they include other countries stocks and bonds in their portfolios think of italian savers having an easier ability to invest in something besides italian banks think of german savers desperate to earn something more than zero on their bank deposits there is a long way to go so how should policymakers unlock the full potential of the capital markets while a number of reforms are needed to achieve more integrated european capital markets let me highlight three key areas first transparency of information capital markets are all about arms length transactions you buy debt or equity claims on someone you ve never met here you rely on public information information you can trust the beating heart is transparency information on firms and financial instruments needs to be widely available at low cost based on strong audits and presented in readily comparable ways a good example is the recently developed standard for securitization which will give preferential regulatory treatment to simple transparent and standardized sts instruments after a transition period only these standardized securitizations will be eligible as ecb collateral securitization developed a bad reputation during the global financial crisis but if properly done it can be used to broaden the investor base and increase funding options for small businesses investors would also greatly benefit from more efficient insolvency regimes this is my second key area the faster and smoother the insolvency process can play out the better this would help free up capital that could be invested more productively elsewhere of course the need for reform varies widely across europe and insolvency procedures are deeply rooted in national traditions resolving a corporate insolvency in greece takes about nine times longer than in ireland for example so yes these reforms tend to be politically difficult and take time but they are worth doing the same is true when it comes to my final area taxation of cross border investments one reason financial investors may be discouraged from venturing far from home is the different rules and procedures each country has on withholding taxes ideally investments in other euro area countries would be treated in the same way as domestic investments at the very least withholding tax rules should be simplified and harmonized to encourage greater diversification in financial portfolios the bottom line is that planting new trees in the capital markets could help promote a single market in finance and transform europe into a more vibrant and more robust economy it is time to replicate in finance what has been achieved in creating the single market for goods and services a project that has raised gdp in the eu by an estimated 9 percent is this overly ambitious a fully integrated eu financial market really time will tell but my money is on europe s courage creativity and perseverance conclusion let me conclude with a quote from molière who once said the trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit some can rightfully argue that europe has been slow to produce a fully developed financial ecosystem going on 20 years the time is ripe for the euro area to show new resolve and complete the banking and capital markets unions so it can harvest the benefits now and in the future thank you very much john f kennedy s address at the university of california at berkeley march 23 1962 when measured by market exchange rates eurobarometer

since the demand for electricity in africa will likely triple by 2030 due to rising living standards industrialisation and growing electrification rates there is an urgent need to fuel the economic growth with sufficient energy to power the continent renewable energy sources are favoured to meet this demand but they can t succeed on public funding alone this article first appeared in esi africa edition 1 2019 you can read the magazine s articles here or subscribe here to receive a print copy in order to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources in the energy mix private investors will have to play a bigger role in financing new investments as public funding is unlikely to increase in comparison to europe and north america financing renewable energy projects across most parts of africa is challenging due to uncertain energy policies and higher financing costs amongst other factors the following de risking tools can be considered to ease the burden on investors public de risking instruments institutional capacity building renewable energy resource assessments grid connection and its proper management skills development for local operations and maintenance are some of the primary public sector measures that help attract investors in addition organised power procurement methods coupled with consistent long term renewable energy policies streamlined permit processes and standardised project documentation can also help entice international developers given their impressive track records and access to vast internal expertise such developers are able to access funding at lower costs the success of initiatives such as the world bank s scaling solar and kfw s get fit programme have shown that a transparent process puts investors at ease and encourages global investments in developing countries with relatively new or underdeveloped renewable energy sectors by directly targeting barriers that create investment risks public institutions can play a major role through policy de risking of both on grid and off grid sectors improvements in the technical capacity and financial stability of energy regulators public utilities and rural electrification agencies can also have a positive impact for the latter financial incentives and targeted subsidies may also be considered to encourage the development of mini grids financial risk mitigation instruments the options available to improve the risk profile of the energy sector in developing countries differ from country to country with more options available in markets with a developed open and stable political system the following three instruments have helped in directly addressing investment risks in several countries guarantee instruments guarantee instruments can improve the structure and quality of renewable energy investments making projects more attractive to private investors these are usually issued by public entities to address political policy credit and currency risks under exceptional circumstances guarantees can be issued to mitigate a technology specific risk such as geothermal resource risk guarantees most governments are increasingly reluctant to issue such guarantees due to financial constraints obligations under the international monetary fund and a lack of capacity to support smaller projects national bank guarantees corporate guarantees and risk guarantees issued by development finance institutions dfis or export credit agencies are viable alternatives political risk insurance pri renewable energy investors often face the risk of unstable political systems as well as inadequate rule of law pri provides tremendous value to investors by allowing them to transfer risks to international institutions with the capacity expertise and local market information to better mitigate them the most popular type of cover for potential lenders and equity holders is the four point pri which insures against breach of contract almost always via arbitral award default transfer restrictions currency inconvertibility expropriation along with the risk of war civil disturbance several institutions such as the multilateral investment guarantee agency the african trade insurance agency ati the islamic corporation for the insurance of investment and export credit along with multilaterals and private insurers are able to provide such policies with varying eligibility criteria partial risk guarantee prg this is a financial guarantee extended to commercial lenders covering payment defaults that result from the non performance of a government or government owned entity on its obligations with respect to the specific project e g the risk of non payment by state owned enterprises change in law regulatory risk expropriation risk etc two key features of prgs are their cover which includes the debt portion of a project and the stipulation that the host government must sign a counter indemnity in favour of the issuer prgs have traditionally been issued by the world bank with the african development bank having recently issued its very first in support of the lake turkana wind farm in kenya for projects that involve an element of trade access to export credit guarantees may be helpful in covering the risk of default on any debt service as well as reducing the financing costs and perceived risk of local lenders mitigation of currency risk currency risk arises in situations where the project has revenue in a local currency and loan payments in hard currency a mismatch that arises often for renewable energy projects an additional risk is that of currency inconvertibility where payments have been made but a lack of hard currency means repayments to foreign investors are not met in addition to pri cover the following may be considered currency hedging instruments the use of forward contracts and swaps as hedging instruments one key consideration for investors will be the cost in comparison to local debt local currency lending dfis can address high hedging costs by investing capital in funds that provide local currency lending through portfolio diversification the tcx currency fund which offers local currency loans in emerging countries as well as guarantco which provides flexible guarantees over local currency loans are market leaders in this space liquidity risk mitigation instruments in addition to the internal tools that could be considered by investors i e debt service reserve accounts over collateralisation excess spread accounts contingent equity additional external options exist which can help better manage this risk in order to see more projects reach financial close for instance the regional liquidity support facility rlsf an initiative of kfw and ati covers up to six months of the independent power producer s revenue via a stand by letter of credit kfw and ati provide the collateral for the letters of credit lessening the burden on power utilities and enabling more projects to reach financial close prgs can also be used to mitigate this risk liquidity guarantees and options provided or backed by dfis are also a way to ensure long term lending for borrowers the availability of grant or public funding would make developing markets more attractive to investors looking to roll out renewable energy products in developing countries investors should also look into the possibility of standardising and aggregating their projects this has been proven to mitigate key risks and increase a project s appeal to both commercial and development banks stable and predictable energy sector policies along with the availability of risk mitigation instruments would make africa more attractive to investors making more projects bankable and increasing the continent s share of the over 250 billion invested globally in renewable energy per year this would also contribute towards the attainment of the un s 2030 sustainable development goal 7 to increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global mix esi about the author samuel obbie banda is a bilingual assistant underwriter with the african trade insurance agency ati based in kenya he is part of the

socialism always fails and a lot of time is being spent these days trying to explain to a generation of young voters why that is always the case not only does socialism fail from an economic standpoint but oftentimes it also is a source of pain and oppression for the masses and yet here we are with sen bernie sanders i vt rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and those among the far left making socialism more acceptable and even chic in some circles socialist hipsters basically an august gallup poll even showed that democrats are more positive about socialism than capitalism when hearing so much talk about how awful venezuela and cuba are how is this possible per the american institute for economic research the cuban model there is a ton of work still to do to help younger americans understand how venezuela and cuba ended up being such horrible places in some cases we even have to explain that yes indeed these are horrible places until venezuela was in the news on a regular basis because of the approach of its people toward starvation as well as the expropriation and daily tyranny from chavez maduro regime there were plenty of intellectuals praising the system and let s not forget the praises or lack of condemnation for the oppressive regime that is cuba coming from many world leaders after fidel castro finally died so yes there is a lot of work to be done however if that s all we do in response to aoc and sanders promising americans that a socialist regime will produce a world where everyone works less earns more gets free healthcare and schooling and receives generous subsidies from the government even when one decides not to work no one tempted by socialism will listen the swedish model that s because when sanders and his ilk talk about socialism they aren t talking about expropriating property rights nationalizing all businesses or eliminating all but one the state s television channel they aren t talking about venezuela or cuba instead they are talking about denmark and sweden it is true that sanders and his people fail to understand that socialism exists on a spectrum on one side you have the dictatorships while on the other side you have the social democracies both sides of the spectrum use oppression and compulsory taxation to achieve their goals but the degree to which they do so varies a great deal this variation in socialist methods gives rise also to variation in the legitimacy of different degrees of socialism no one seriously ever thinks of french president emmanuel macron as a despot even though his own people happen to call him tyrannical on a regular basis in spite of the gigantic size of the french state and the enormous amount of taxes extracted by the regime one side allows elections the other side either forbids them or makes a mockery of the concept yet it is also true that all varieties of socialism fail to achieve their goals for the same reason all varieties attempt to one degree or another to substitute the decisions of government planners for those of private citizens interacting in competitive markets and in doing so all varieties of socialism suffer from the insurmountable knowledge problem as beautifully demonstrated by the late economist don lavoie in his book 1985 book national economic planning what is left that said there is still a vast difference between venezuela and denmark in terms of how much of the economy planners try to control and as a result how much of the economy planners destroy i worry that if we keep talking as if today s american democrats envision controls as extensive as exist in venezuela those of us who warn of the dangers that lurk in the schemes of sanders and aoc won t get through the french model in addition to this difficulty is the fact that while they claim that they are talking about nordic countries what sanders and aoc actually have in mind is a regime more like that of france when sweden and denmark each had in place a regime closer to what sanders is talking about the results were so bad that each of these countries put in place pretty dramatic free market reforms these two countries are by no means libertarian paradises but thanks to large spending cuts and lower taxes they aren t the hot mess that they once were france is though such a mess that s because there is one aspect in particular that the aocs and sanderses of the world fail to mention to their followers when they talk about their socialist dream all of the goodies that they believe the american people are entitled to receive in fact come at a great cost and so the only way to pay for these goodies is with oppressive and regressive taxes i e taxes heaped on to the backs of the middle class and the poor france was once a role model for what big government can do for its people but it has become an embarrassing example since the gilets jaunes took to the streets to demonstrate against the insane amount of taxes they pay these guys aren t upper class they are the people who have until now supported the policies that are inevitable when you have the government providing so many services and involved so deeply in so much of the economy talking about taxes the wsj had a good summary of the situation the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd released its annual revenue statistics report this week and france topped the charts with a tax take equal to 46 2 of gdp in 2017 that s more than denmark 46 sweden 44 and germany 37 5 and far more than the oecd average 34 2 or the u s 27 1 which includes all levels of government france doesn t collect that revenue in the ways you might think despite the stereotype of heavy european income taxes on the rich paris relies disproportionately on social insurance payroll and property taxes social taxes account for 37 of french revenue the oecd average is 26 payroll and property taxes contribute 3 and 9 compared to the oecd averages of 1 and 6 as a reminder the payroll tax is very regressive it consumes a larger share of low and middle class earners than rich people in addition then europe adds a regressive consumption tax the value added tax in france vat and other consumption taxes make up 24 of revenue and that s on the low side compared to an oecd average of 33 consumption taxes often fall hardest on the poor and middle class who devote a greater proportion of their income to consumption to be sure the spending is also more regressive in france in that the biggest share goes to the middle and low income earners but it is a stupid system in which you tax one group to redistribute to that same group add one more increase to an already high and regressive gas tax in france to the existing 214 taxes and duties and the people went nuts they have been protesting continuously since november 17th 2018 i don t condone the violence but i understand why the protestors are so furious regimentation in labor their anger is further fueled by the very rigid labor market france has all sorts of labor regulations on the books some preventing firms from firing workers and hence creating a disincentive to hire workers in the first place other regulations such as the minimum wage that make the cost of employing people so high that employers don t employ people it is also not surprising that so many fast food restaurants in france have replaced employees with robots like other countries the french also have all sorts of generous family friendly laws that end up backfiring and penalizing female employment the french government is also very generous to those people who don t work all of these policies make the lives of lower and middle class people harder unemployment is high 24 5 percent for young french people and economic growth has been anemic for decades the bottom line is this all those people in america who currently fall for the socialism soup that aoc and sanders are selling need to realize that if their dream came to pass they not the rich not the bankers and politicians will be ones suffering the most from the high taxes high unemployment and slow growth that go hand in hand with the level of public spending they want everyone would suffer of course but those who will be screwed the most are definitely those at the bottom

this article is more than 5 years old the donald trump of asia that s how the international media labeled rodrigo duterte in 2016 when the firebrand won the philippine presidency turns out it s the other way around true duterte s shock election win predated the u s president s by 183 days but the strongman rallied voters with trumpian bluster anti establishment populism and a volatile temperament even more intriguing though is the extent to which trump is cribbing from the duterte playbook with a touch of ferdinand marcos tossed in duterte reveres the dictator who ran the philippines into the ground over 20 years until 1986 he even accorded marcos a hero s burial that the marcos clan had long sought he also favors maneuvering ferdinand marcos jr into the vice presidency trump s own rise to power owes much to a former marcos associate paul manafort the trump campaign chairman was once part of washington s torturers lobby that helped despots polish their image manafort clients included somalia s mohamed siad barre zaire s mobutu sese seko and marcos since becoming president in january 2017 trump has indeed cribbed from the authoritarian playbook bringing his family into the oval office seeing the presidency as a business opportunity working to neuter the judiciary the legislature and the media anything that might check his worst impulses but is america or the global economy prepared for the dutertefication to come particularly in the coming post mueller report no holds barred era here are four areas to watch as trump scrambles to win reelection over the next 586 days one weaponizing the fake news mantra though trump rarely misses an opportunity to slam the media duterte has racked up a big win against a journalistic nemesis last month authorities arrested maria ressa the award winning founder of rappler which duterte channeling trump calls a fake news outlet the vague allegations of libel and tax law violations seem well trumped up human rights watch calls it politically motivated retribution for criticizing duterte s ghastly war on drugs yet duterte s antimedia schtick is having the intended effect in some circles self censorship by editors fearing their own court date trump has tiptoed in that direction not since richard nixon s day has a white house gone so aggressively after media foes team trump has selectively tried to revoke press credentials reportedly looking to punish media barons like washington post owner jeff bezos and allegedly worked to block a media merger now trump seems newly empowered to go after reporters holding him accountable granted the findings of special counsel robert mueller probe of russian involvement in the 2016 election remain secret yet as team trump claims total exoneration the white house is even making lists of media enemies ominous stuff to which filipinos can attest two sidelining institutions trump has long since unleashed his venom on national security apparatuses the next assaults on norms could really hurt take trump s ploy to install a crony who loathes the world bank to run it david malpass would be to this most vital of institutions what john bolton is to diplomacy might trump feeling unburdened by investigation heighten his assault on the united nations and nato too will he stay in the world trade organization which trump thinks rigs markets against america could trump effectively stop going to group of 20 meetings annoyed china has a seat at the table then there s duterte like shenanigans at the federal reserve duterte recently shocked many by naming a loyalist to run bangko sentral ng pilipinas which spent much of 2018 tightening policy already benjamin diokno is hinting at lower rates despite one of asia s fastest inflation rates trump is feuding with his own central bank run by handpicked governor jerome powell he s called powell s team crazy and blamed its rate hikes for the failure to reach 4 growth now trump proposes an economic hack and sycophant for an empty fed board seat the risk of stephen moore having a vote on monetary decisions should scare investors everywhere three erratic behavior manila has seen a bull market in odd inexplicable and self defeating policy u turns under duterte when the un criticized his bloody drug war and 12 000 body bags says human rights watch duterte suggested throwing officials to the crocodiles when barack obama spoke out duterte called the former u s president a son of a whore duterte called god stupid and slammed the pope sounding more like an asian henry viii than leader of a devoutly catholic nation he s threatened to hang european union officials critical of his government he s compared his policies to adolf hitler he s threatened to throw

london turkey s lira whipsawed in value again on thursday as the disclosure of a sudden drop in the central bank s foreign reserves sparked fears among investors about the country s economic stewardship the ailing economy is expected to be a primary concern among voters in local elections on sunday the lira dropped as much as 5 percent against the united states dollar on thursday before recovering to close up 2 4 percent at 5 541 to the dollar but investors appeared to be worried about apparent efforts by the central bank of turkey to shore up the lira s value data released by the central bank on thursday showed that its foreign exchange reserves dropped last week by 2 billion from the week before to 71 billion apparently reflecting efforts by the bank to purchase the currency capital controls were put in place this week preventing banks from lending to foreigners in an effort to keep the lira s value up instead of providing reassurance however the move caused investors to worry that their cash would remain trapped in turkey that prompted many to sell their lira holdings for dollars depleting the central bank s reserves which raised the specter of the bank s running out of cash prompting yet more selling

president and chief executive officer thank you alan good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our increased guidance for the current year the momentum we experienced throughout the year continued in q4 and we are pleased to have finished the year strong our financial results and over achievement reflects the successful execution of the growth strategy we implemented approximately two years ago which we have discussed on prior calls this was another year of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins with earnings growing faster than revenue our annual results on a gaap basis were 1 23 billion of revenue and 1 diluted net income per share on a non gaap basis we achieved revenue of 1 245 billion and diluted net income per share of 3 21 we delivered a 14 increase in non gaap earnings with nearly two points of operating margin expansion cash from operations also came in very strong at 250 million a 22 increase year over year as that momentum continues we are raising guidance once again for the current year our guidance for the non gaap revenue is increasing by 25 million to 1 37 billion representing 10 growth and acceleration from the prior year we are also increasing our guidance for non gaap eps by 0 10 the 3 60 representing 12 year over year growth let me take a step back and discuss how we have created such strong momentum over the last several years our customers and the market at large have expressed mounting business and security challenges and we ve responded by infusing more automation innovation into our actionable intelligence platform we believe that increasing our pace of automation and cloud innovation has further differentiated verint as the vendor of choice in our markets we now estimate the size of the actionable intelligence markets to be at approximately 10 billion and growing at a double digit rate verint is one of the industry s strongest research and development teams focused on actionable intelligence with about 2 000 in r d out of total 6 000 professionals we are innovating at an increasingly rapid pace our intellectual property is backed by close to 1 000 patents and applications worldwide of course data capture unstructured data analytics artificial intelligence and automation demonstrating our increased focus on automation just over the last 24 months we have filed for 150 patents related to automation our actionable intelligence platform service the technology foundation for our broad portfolio across customer engagement and cyber intelligence we believe the strength of our platform and the investments we ve made in automation and cloud are behind our momentum and positive outlook now i would like to review our results by segments starting with customer engagements total revenue for the year was 811 million on a non gaap basis representing a 7 5 increase year over year we are pleased with our customer engagement momentum and expect revenue growth to accelerate again in the current year to 10 our strategy is to help organizations simplify modernize and automate customer engagements to address two important business challenges we believe these challenges has escalated and have become increasingly critical over the last couple of years emerging as top priorities for organizations to address the first challenge is that today people demand better customer engagement and express organizations to make improvements to elevate their customer experience increasingly organizations are recognizing this need and are looking for cost effective ways to respond a recent poll showed that 71 of boardrooms consider customer experience to be their top metric another poll showed that 81 of cmos expect to compete and differentiate based on customer experience a much larger percentage than just a few years ago the second challenge is that digital transformation is driving an increase in the number of customer interactions causing organizations to hire and expand their workforce leading to unsustainable cost increases according to industry research the number of interactions is currently growing by more than 60 per year and there are already tens of millions of people employed globally in customer service functions with workforce cost exceeding 1 trillion annually historically initiatives that we re focused primarily on customer experience often resulted in increased operating costs and initiatives that we re focused primarily on efficiencies often resulted in poor customer experience more than ever before organizations are focused on balancing these challenges innovating customer experience and at the same time reducing operating costs we believe the market is at an inflection point looking for new technology to address these escalating challenges based on our customers inputs we identified this critical industry challenges early and started to infuse automation throughout our portfolio in response we leveraged our actionable intelligence platform combined with the strong customer engagement expertise and today we deliver significant roi for our customers across the enterprise our portfolio helps organizations elevate customer experience while reducing operating costs and with automation across enterprise to many functions including contact centers back office operations digital and mobile marketing as well as security and compliance our software makes employees more productive enables an emerging hybrid workforce in which humans and robots work together supports more interactions to be handled via self service captures the voice of the customer distilling it into actionable insights and automates fraud and compliance functions overall we believe that our simplified modernized and automated strategy is differentiated and can drive double digit revenue growth in customer engagements over the long run turning to cloud i m pleased to report that our cloud growth rates have accelerated we ended the fourth quarter with 200 million of cloud arr on a non gaap basis representing a year over year increase of approximately 40 based on this strong momentum we expect cloud revenue in the current year to increase more than 40 this will drive our cloud revenue to nearly 250 million for the year behind this acceleration is increased market cloud adoption and the strength of the verint cloud our cloud strategy is to help customers transition to the cloud at their own pace our entire customer engagement portfolio is offered in a hybrid cloud model for maximum customer flexibility and scales from smb to very large enterprise customer it s important to note that the 250 million of cloud revenue we expect this year will be generated predominantly from new customers or new cloud deployments just recently our customers have began to explore the conversion of their verint customer engagement on premise solution to the cloud such conversion could result in a significant revenue uplift for verint as a dollar of maintenance revenue can convert to cloud revenue at a 2x rates we currently generate over 300 million of maintenance revenue per year and future conversion to cloud presents a significant opportunity for increased revenue and profitability based on our cloud leadership increased market cloud adoption the level of growth we have recently achieved and the potential for our installed base to migrate to the cloud we re targeting strong cloud growth over the next three years with the cagr of 30 to 40 turning to our customer base we have more than 10 000 customers including more than 85 of the fortune 100 our strong customer relationships drive high renewal rates and the opportunity to land and expand with our broad and growing portfolio during the quarter we ve received many large orders from existing customer and new customers including many competitive displacements reflecting our strategy to help customers simplify modernize and automate here are few highlights of recent customer wins a 6 million cloud order from a leading travel management company looking to modernize customer engagement by moving from several on premises point solutions to the verint cloud this large order was a competitive displacements and we believe we were selected due to the strength of our cloud solutions and strong automation innovation a 6 million order from a leading utilities company this customer decided to deploy itself to our solutions on premises and some in the cloud taking advantage of our flexible hybrid cloud model a 5 million order from a leading financial services company looking to infuse more automation into its operations this was another competitive displacements and we believe we were selected due to our automation differentiation a 2 million cloud order from a leading ridesharing ph company looking to manage its rapidly growing workforce we believe we were selected due to our ability to address business challenges across the enterprise including call centers back office operations and branches with a global cloud deployments a 2 million cloud order from a leading financial services company looking to gain customer experience insights this was another competitive displacement and we believe we were selected due to our ability to capture and analyze voice of the customer across many channels and finally i would like to highlight another q4 win which reflects our strong customer relationship and the success of our land and expand strategy this leading telecommunications company gave us total of 20 million in orders in the year of which a 7 million order came in in q4 in addition to our success in the enterprise market today we generate around 15 of our customer engagement revenue from smb customers over the last several years we ve invested in our smb portfolio and today we offer smb customers a purpose built cloud solution designed to address their preferences for ease of deployments and ease of use in addition we expanded our partner program with a growing sets of cloud partners that sell our product to both smb and enterprise customers verint partners benefit from our communication infrastructure neutrality open system approach and our strong domain expertise overall we are pleased with our strong finish to the year particularly with our cloud acceleration we re also pleased to be in a position to raise guidance in the current year as well as provide a three year outlook for strong cloud growth turning to cyber intelligence total non gaap revenue for the year was 434 million representing a 10 increase year over year we are pleased with our continued momentum and expect to deliver another year of 10 growth we re also pleased with the 2 margin expansion we achieved last year and will discuss a long term targets for cyber intelligence margin expansion later in the call we live in the world where security threats are becoming more pervasive and complex at the same time data volumes are growing rapidly making legacy data mining tools less effective as a result security organizations are seeking more advanced data mining software to better detect investigate and neutralize threats we believe the cyber intelligence addressable market size is about 4 billion and the ongoing demand for advanced data mining software provides the sustained double digit growth opportunity our strategy is to introduce advanced data mining software that can further automate the intelligence and shorten the investigative processes for our customers while reducing dependency on large numbers of intelligence analysts and data scientists today we offer organizations a broad solution portfolio across three security domains cyber intelligence cybersecurity and situational intelligence in cyber intelligence we help law enforcement and national security organizations capture a large amount of data from a variety of sources and turn it into actionable intelligence to help prevent crime and terror in cybersecurity we help government s cyber authorities an enterprise c source capture network and endpoint data and identify malware and cyber attacks and in situation intelligence we help governments and enterprises capture a large amount of data from devices and databases and deliver actionable insights to protect people and assets our customer base in cyber intelligence is growing last year we added 100 new customers and we now have more than 1 000 customers globally across government and enterprise today government customers represents approximately 80 of our cyber intelligence revenue we provide our data mining software to diversified set of 400 government agencies across more than 100 countries we have long standing relationship with customers around the world and a significant portion of our cyber intelligence revenue comes from repeat business the remaining 20 of our revenue comes from enterprise customers we have 600 enterprise customers across many verticals such as telecom service providers financial services retail and critical infrastructure including many large companies who are leaders in their industries in q4 we continue to win many large deals around the world including recently receiving an order of close to 20 million two orders around 15 million each and three orders in excess of 5 million each we believe our success in winning these large deals in q4 is due to our ability to anticipate market trends and quickly bring innovative solutions to markets we believe the combination of our leadership position and strong market demand for advanced data mining software will enable us to continue to grow revenue at a double digit rate supporting our outlook in an expanding customer base across governments and enterprises providing us strong visibility as previously discussed we re executing a plan for significant margin expansion in our cyber intelligence segment and i m pleased to report on our progress and outlook over the last two years we have invested to transition the business to a more software model we have already achieved 3 margin improvement over the last two years and expect our margins to continue to expand this year as our revenue shift to more software and less pass through hardware over the next three years we are targeting an additional 5 margin expansion driving our cyber intelligence adjusted ebitda margins to more than 20 overall we are pleased with the execution of our cyber intelligence strategy driving strong revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion before turning the call over to doug i would like to summarize as follows we believe our strong results and over achievement reflects the successful execution of the growth strategy we launched approximately two years ago with this strategy we are accelerating our pace of innovation to further differentiate verint in a market that is increasingly embracing actionable intelligence solutions we are experiencing strong momentum driven by automation and cloud adoption and finally we believe that our addressable market is growing at a double digit rates and that we are well positioned for sustained growth and market leadership and now let me turn the call over to doug douglas robinson chief financial officer yeah thanks dan and good afternoon everyone our discussion today will include non gaap financial measures a reconciliation between our gaap to non gaap financial measures is available as alan mentioned in our earnings release and in the ir section of our website differences between our gaap and non gaap financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions including fair value revenue adjustments amortization of acquisition related intangibles certain other acquisition related expenses stock based compensation as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency i ll start my discussion today reviewing our fiscal 2019 performance and then talk about what we re expecting for fiscal 2020 we finished the year with solid momentum and had strength across the business each of the quarters built upon one before and we are well positioned going into the new year for the full year we generated 1 245 billion of non gaap revenue up 8 from the prior year we experienced strong growth in both of our segments with 811 million of non gaap revenue in customer engagement up approximately 7 5 year over year and 434 million of non gaap revenue in cyber intelligence up approximately 10 from last year we achieved expansion of our gross margins with full year non gaap gross margins of 66 6 about a point higher compared to last year we ve experienced that expansion in both segments with cyber intelligence full year gross margins expanding 2 points for the year our non gaap operating income increased 18 year over year to 267 million driving an operating margin of 21 4 and approximately 2 point expansion our objective has been to grow earnings at a rate greater than revenue and we re very pleased with the operating margin improvement we experienced for the year our adjusted ebitda for the year was almost 300 million up 16 from last year this performance drove diluted non gaap eps of 3 21 for the year compared to 2 81 in the prior year a 14 year over year increase we are pleased with the earnings leverage we re achieving as we work to expand our gross margins in both segments and also in achieving some cost efficiencies with our operating expenses with respect to the balance sheet at the end of q4 we had 468 million of cash and short term investments including short term and long term restricted cash and investments we had very strong cash flow from operations on a gaap basis in q4 of 84 million resulting in 250 million of gaap cash from operations for the full year a 22 increase from last year the strong year over year increase in gaap cash flow from operations also demonstrates the positive business and earnings momentum we re achieving and speaks to the overall health of the business we ended the quarter with net debt of 351 million including long term restricted cash and investments and excluding discounts and issuance cost primarily associated with our convertible debt when we look at our fiscal ended 2019 results you can see the tremendous progress we ve made over the last three years in terms of revenue and earnings growth looking to fiscal year ending 2020 we see that momentum continuing and are raising guidance to 1 37 billion of revenue plus or minus 2 and 3 60 earnings per share at the midpoint both on a non gaap basis i would now like to provide you some new metrics to help you understand the momentum we re experiencing starting with customer engagement in customer engagement in fiscal 2020 we expect revenue growth of about 10 on a non gaap basis this is a higher rate of growth than we ve experienced in the past several years driven in part by an acceleration in our cloud business we expect our cloud revenue to increase more than 40 approaching 250 million overall we expect close to 900 million of non gaap revenue in customer engagement for fiscal 2020 with the majority of our revenue coming from three sources cloud maintenance and contract is already in place as of the beginning of the year these three components represent about 70 of the annual revenue we expect to achieve and provides us good visibility into the year with respect to margins we believe margins will continue to expand in customer engagement and expect an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 28 5 for the year in cyber intelligence in fiscal 2020 we expect revenue growth of around 10 with continuing margin expansion as we continue to shift to more of a software model overall we expect around 475 million of revenue with the majority of our revenue coming from contracts we already had in place at the beginning of the year maintenance and some subscription these three components also represent about 70 of the annual revenue we expect to achieve providing us good visibility into the year at this guidance level we expect an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 16 5 before going to q a i d like to provide some additional input for your fiscal 2020 models we expect our non gaap quarterly interest and other expense excluding the potential impact of foreign exchange to be approximately 5 7 million given volatility and foreign exchange rates there could be future gains or losses related to balance sheet translations in our future results which are not included in our guidance we expect our non gaap tax rate to be approximately 11 for the year reflecting the amount of cash taxes we expect to pay this year and for share count we expect to have approximately 67 5 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year in addition to our annual guidance we d like to provide some color on the progression of the year for modeling purposes for non gaap revenue in q1 we expect revenue to increase around 8 year over year to 315 million we expect sequential increases in q2 and q3 followed by our usual of seasonally strong q4 relative to margins we expect earnings per share to increase approximately 14 year over year to around 0 60 in the first quarter driven by continued margin expansion when we look beyond the current year we are targeting sustained double digit revenue growth and margin expansion over the next three years in customer engagement growth will be fueled by growing our cloud revenue which we are targeting at 30 to 40 cagr which will enable us to double our cloud business in less than three years and in cyber intelligence growth will be driven by demand for data mining solutions and the transition to a software model which we are targeting it will take our cyber intelligence adjusted ebitda margins to above 20 in conclusion we will leave demand for our actionable intelligence solutions to remain strong and we continue to execute well on our growth strategy with a focus on automation and cloud with the momentum of our customer engagement cloud business and the need for innovative data mining software in our cybersecurity business we feel we are well positioned and are pleased to be raising revenue guidance to 10 growth with another year of expanding margins so with that operator can we please open up the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from andy miller of jefferies your line is now open samad samana jefferies analyst hi good afternoon this is actually samad samana from jefferies thanks for taking my questions today congrats on a great quarter and strong close to the year and impressive i think we are most impressed by the cloud revenue size and the growth forecast that the company gave there and dan i was just wondering if maybe you could help us understand what the drivers of that high revenue growth are first for new customer additions versus maintenance conversion and how we should think about the cadence of that opportunity and i m also just curious if there is any incentives or any sales with the sales organization to drive that very impressive cloud growth and then i have a follow up question daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yes yes thank you i ll be happy to explain on cloud so as we ve discussed prior calls enterprise customers have been interested in a move to the cloud and what we ve seen lately is that they ve accelerated the cloud adoption and cloud purchases so what we expect this year 250 million in cloud revenue is predominantly from new deployments so either new customers or deployments to existing customers but the main is conversion basically has not started yet we had a handful of customers that converted maintenance revenue into cloud and we expect our maintenance revenue grew last year we actually expect maintenance revenue to grow this year as well but we think that the conversion is about to begin but our growth this year we have expect more than 40 with very little maintenance conversion so it s all new deployments and it s really fueled by our readiness and the market readiness so i think the smb market is obviously adopted cloud faster and i spoke about what we re doing for smb customers and we see that as a growth opportunity but we see more adoption also at the high end of the market for larger enterprise customers so let me explain more why we feel very strong about our ability to address the customer needs and to help them move to the customer with their own pace we have a differentiated offering in cloud that is spacing that based on four factors one is very broad portfolio that is all available in the cloud and the sales force is leading with saas first at the same time we have a hybrid cloud model to give customers maximum flexibility and as i mentioned in some of the large wins that i discussed today we have customers that s clearly prefer to deploy some of our solutions in the cloud and some on prem and they can actually deploy verint solution on the verint cloud they can deploy it on the partner cloud or they can deploy it on the cloud or own prem or any combination and that s a great strength we also offer a very strong feature priority between on prem and cloud which make it easier to customers to move from on prem to cloud and all these are really really strong differentiated cloud capabilities in addition i mentioned few customer wins where we have global deployments so we are able to deliver cloud in many countries and you re dealing with all of the data privacy and the need to have data centers in different geographies and we have deployed across the globe and our offering also scaled from smb all the way up to the enterprise so i think that very strong offering we believe that we are today the largest cloud vendor in our market and remember we don t sell communication infrastructure products so we ve built a scale to be the largest and we also believe that we are the best vendor to provide customers clouds at the pace of our customer needs so samad samana jefferies analyst i think it s very helpful daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah go ahead samad samana jefferies analyst maybe just one follow up as you mentioned the company has a really broad cloud portfolio and we think that s one of the things that s driving new business and new wins i m curious if there s which areas within that portfolio of cloud are particularly in the hybrid environment which ones are the most popular to put in the cloud versus the ones that are being kept on premise daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer so i think it s really more by enterprise function again we sell across the enterprise contact center back office digital mobile marketing and so on marketing solution we sell to marketing usually have very very high cloud adoption already well the solution in the operation typically large customers tend to do it slower so it s not so much by product it s more by adoption of the market depends more on the market function and also how much it really wants to move and modernize the organization but we are ready across our portfolio and we see good traction with basically all our products moving to the cloud i want to mention also just one more thing just to have a complete response on the cloud dynamics that the maintenance conversion that is still ahead of us we have seen opportunity to get a great revenue uplift because a conversion could be typically at the 2x rate because we basically are helping our customers not just to move the license from on prem to cloud but also to host the software for our clients and we have a very efficient hosting infrastructure that is more efficient to clients which creates a great opportunity for them to save money while moving to the cloud and at the same time we get a revenue uplift and also increased profitability samad samana jefferies analyst great that s very helpful thanks again and congrats on a great quarter daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gabriela borges of goldman sachs your line is now open gabriela borges goldman sachs analyst great good afternoon thanks for taking my question and for all the incremental detail on the cloud opportunity i had a sit down for doug maybe help us understand the implication for your typical perpetual license sale i m just wondering how we gauge the dynamic where if incremental growth is coming on via cloud how do we avoid a scenario of perpetual license falls off more rapidly and you get a little bit of air pocket in the p l thanks douglas robinson chief financial officer yeah sure we see this is being migration we expect a lot of customers will continue along with some perpetual licenses at the same time other customers are doing more on cloud but we ve modeled that in we have some scenarios if we look at in terms of conversion rates and we feel comfortable we can absorb any fall off the perpetual license with the growth we have in the cloud going forward daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah in the same time we have better margins on cloud than on our on prem so we have built at scale to what do we expect this year of 250 million actually it was margin expansion if you look at the last couple of years while we are building a cloud business we also are improving our gross margins and we talked in the past about the fact that you know an on prem implementation is software license and professional services and that s us implementation multi tenant size comes with margin of 80 so the more our customers move to the cloud we will expect to see continued margin expansion gabriela borges goldman sachs analyst that s very helpful thank you and a follow up is on the cyber intelligence business maybe just give us a little bit of a sense of how customers are thinking about spending over the course of the year and the type of visibility that you have into that business relative to prior years thanks daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so our visibility is strong we entered the year with approximately 70 of the expected revenue that we have visibility and that s pretty similar to last year but of course we are expecting another 10 growth this year so visibility of 70 is strong and it s been our experience over the last couple of years where we were driving double digit growth i think the curse with the market is large is clearly demanding a more advanced data mining software we have customers that are embedded with data and they needs the data mining software to be able to make sense of the data i can give you an example of the cybersecurity customer that reported to us after we implemented our software in their soc security operating center that they were able to cut the investigation time from one week to four hours in average and you know that the problem in the soc today there is a lot of alerts that require cyber analyst to follow up on these alerts investigate and find out if these are just false alarms or real malware and the ability to use data mining software and accelerates the investigation and achieve acceleration of one week to four hours obviously leads to being able to make the cyber analysis much more effective in protecting the organization so there is an ongoing demand we believe it s a double digit growth opportunity the market is growing double digit and we are well positioned with a strong portfolio to grow at that pace gabriela borges goldman sachs analyst i appreciate the detail thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from daniel ives of wedbush securities your line is now open daniel ives wedbush securities analyst yeah thank you and congrats again so maybe you could just talk about the cloud transition in terms on call center what you re seeing how the conversations changed with customers especially over the last three to six months versus where you were a year ago thanks daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer i think the sales force is still giving our customers the flexibility to choose the deployment that they prefer from that perspective i think we continue to be neutral to customer preferences but as we just see acceleration in customer adoption in the enterprise area and in smb i think what change is that we invested in creating more purpose built solution for smb so we took a product downstream we made an easier to deploy and easier to use and leveraging a growing ecosystem of partners cloud partners i think we are better positioned to address the strong demand for cloud in the smb space so acceleration for us in both areas and with our own strength and the ability to be very efficient with delivering these solutions we re also very competitive in terms of price and in terms of the features security quality all the cloud features that are important to our customers in addition to the functionality of the application daniel ives wedbush securities analyst got it okay and when you re thinking even from a recurring revenue from visibility just given what s going on the model how should we think about that from like an arr perspective increased visibility maybe in the model that we re seeing over the next 12 to 18 months should we use to measure that or otherwise we should think about the business from a high level in terms of that visibility stream douglas robinson chief financial officer so no yeah you can certainly measure that we have recurring revenue of approximately 60 and improving from last year and with the cloud acceleration that we see and we gave a cagr of 30 to 40 over the next three years our recurring revenue would be approaching 70 so we believe that some enterprise customers we still prefer on prem deployments but we clearly think that we are moving with much faster growth in cloud over the next few years that will improve recurring revenue and again we think that this growth will partially come for maintenance conversion but that s going to take some time and we certainly see a lot of new deployments as we saw so far that will be cloud deployments and of course if the maintenance conversion is going to happen faster then we have an upside opportunity operator thank you and our next question comes from hugh cunningham of oppenheimer your line is now open hugh cunningham oppenheimer analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question i want to beat this to death but on the cloud side it seems like the what we considered a concern about security on the cloud that concern on the part of your customers has gone away and i m wondering is there anything else that is holding customers back and then on your side it seems like you re maintaining sort of a neutral stand for your customers giving them what they want but are you going to maybe shift or tilt your approach a little bit in the future toward maybe pushing cloud more and then finally on the cyber side you ve seem so much more confident on cyber intelligence now and i think doug mentioned margins above 20 well i think it s three years out but margins ultimately above 20 did i hear that right and one i think that s higher than you used to talk about and then specifically on the cyber side what are you seeing in emerging markets are the emerging markets showing on continued signs of strength any concerns or what s happening there thanks daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer so yes you heard right the number 20 and of course those if you are able to see the slides on the webex i think we make it also very clear there but let me start with the cloud question and then we ll give some more details on cyber intelligence so in terms of market adoption in security there are as i mentioned before there are customers that we believe for many many years to come will still want to host solutions in their own data centers but because of security and other reasons so we don t think that 100 of our customers will transition to the cloud but we see obviously a growing number of customers are comfortable with the security levels that we offering and yes we have invested quite a bit in providing a high level of security to our customers over time so i think that pushing our customers is not a good idea but i think the customers don t want be pushed they want to be led to understand the benefits of cloud i think that we are able to show them that some of the concerns they have are no longer real concern and at the same time some of the quality and cost efficiencies that we ve introduced as we create more scale we re able to pass some of these saving also to our customers so i think we can help customers to get more comfortable in their journey to the cloud and do it faster but we don t really need to push them there these are very large companies and long standing customers we still have land and expand opportunity they re buying more of our portfolio and i think they really value that we are a trusted partner overall we just to kind of summarize on these points our projection for this year for more than 40 cloud growth would does not require further pushing of the customers it s really based on the strong arr that we ve finished the year and based on projection of continue to behave the same way and we believe that our cloud adoption will get better over time so hopefully that that answers the cloud question so now let s get some more details on cyber intelligence we are discussing today with more confidence the margin expansion because we ve made investments over the last two years to transition our product to software model and make it easier for our customers to buy the software and provide the hardware the hardware themselves go through integrators we ve mentioned before that this is both an investment that we need to make in our products but also it s market adoption and by now we spoke to a lot of our customers and explain to them the benefits and we see that they really like the direction we also have 3 margin expansion over the last two years and that s why we are comfortable to give today three year targets for additional margin expansion of 5 over the next three years so for the number 20 20 is we have finished the year with 15 5 ebitda margin in cyber intelligence and we expect to be over 20 within the next three years so that s the margin expansion it s really it s consistent with what we explained before that we used to sell hardware that our customers prefer to buy the software and the hardware together from verint and that we are in a transition to shift the past these past two hardware that really we don t make and we don t really in the business of filling hardware so we re shifting that away and that s replacing that with obviously higher margin software revenue that overall increase our gross margin and ebitda margin hugh cunningham oppenheimer analyst sure and you successfully executed a similar transaction i think or process on ce i might final part of my question dan was on the emerging markets daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so we have a very diversified customer base now we mentioned that we added 100 customers last year more than 1 000 customers about 400 government agencies different government agencies so on average four agencies per country obviously some countries more some less but on the government side we feel it s quite diversified of course many agencies in many countries and then we have 600 customers in enterprise and enterprise is going faster so we are getting more scale and more densification in our cyber intelligence business we do not see any issues with emerging markets right now that cause us to be concerned and we face strong demand and strong pipeline across the world hugh cunningham oppenheimer analyst thank you dan operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff kessler of imperial capital your line is now open jeff kessler imperial capital analyst thank you i have a question here and i m going to get it out slowly because it s kind of complicated with the amount of new sensors that are out there either that range from highly sophisticated sensors at the high end down to do it yourself sensors at the residential level the amount of information and data that is going to responders as well as those who are out there to analyze this data is just growing at an exponential rate overwhelming the ability of at the home level police departments to respond and at the larger level obviously discussions with regard to civil public private partnerships and how much they can handle what are you doing and what opportunities do you see in the ability to provide responders with actionable intelligence whether it s at very low level or at the obviously at the high level where there has been some backup in civil security types of programs simply because they don t have either of the people or they don t have the budgets to handle the amount of data that they re dealing with daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yes we refer to this as a data mining software for the iot internet of things because they are more and more like you said sensors devices but there is more and more devices connected to the internet that generates data and the ability to collect the iot data and apply data mining software which is basically analytics and automation is really at the core of trying to bring insights and do more security with fewer people so we have for example a global semiconductor company with facilities all over the world that recently became a customer for situational intelligence and in this case we are helping them to collect data from the iot and also fuse that data with their own databases that they have about their employees their vendors their access authorities into different parts of the facility and try to it will bring those insights to identify issues related to either people safety or protection of assets so the whole situation intelligence business i think is also an early stage opportunity for actionable intelligence and one that i think at this point just a leading the leading companies in their industries are starting to really adopt this and again for those of you look at the slides that we have in conjunction with this call and they will be obviously posted you can see that we list some of our cyber intelligence enterprise customers and they are very large companies and leaders in their industries jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay a follow up to that is in the ability what is right now we see that there is probably about 13 14 hiring going on just for it personnel how are you particularly on the what i would call your cybersecurity it s going to call cyber cyber physical capabilities what are you doing to get more revenues out of larger customers and particularly in areas like critical infrastructure to protect to involve them in the you want to quote that physical nature of making sure that that compliance is dealt with in hipaa rules financial regs regarding protecting the cyber side of it how do you get extra revenues from helping them on the you want to quote the quasi physical area of making sure that data is secure daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer i think that a lot of these companies are building soc for physical security that are becoming more and more similar to the cybersecurity soc because they can have as you said they can hire people and have this people all over the place they want to bring the data into a centralized operating center and in that center they want to make the data into actionable insights and a force multiplier so they can do more with fewer people this is exactly the sweet spot for our actionable intelligence offering and the adoption of this technology i believe is still in the early stage in the physical security market but in our cyber intelligence business i mentioned that we are operating in three domains the cyber intelligence the cybersecurity and the situation intelligence and this opportunity that you re discussing jeff is around institution intelligence for physical security and critical infrastructure and we have a strong solution in this area as you know and i think this market adoption will see also acceleration of our growth rates in this domain jeff kessler imperial capital analyst so you re seeing this as the infancy of this area daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer i think this area was more focused on deploying people and sensors and devices and much less interested in advance data mining software i think that the governments and cybersecurity authorities were more advanced in understanding the power of intelligence and yes this is infancy in terms of the intelligence situation bringing intelligence into the situational awareness market what we call situation intelligence is still in an early stage jeff kessler imperial capital analyst thank you very much i appreciate it daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer sure jeff operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this does conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to alan roden for any closing remarks alan roden senior vice

by jomo kwame sundaram anis chowdhury ips news kuala lumpur and sydney mar 26 ips the world bank has successfully legitimized the notion that private finance is the solution to pressing development and welfare concerns including achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs through agenda 2030 a recent mckinsey report estimates that the world needs to invest about us 3 3 trillion or 3 8 per cent of world output yearly in economic infrastructure with about three fifths in emerging market and other developing economies to maintain current growth the world financing gap is about us 350 billion yearly if new commitments such as the sdgs are considered the gap would be about thrice the currently estimated gap as available public resources alone are not enough thus for the bank the success of agenda 2030 depends on massive private sector participation maximizing finance the bank s maximizing finance for development mfd strategy marks a new stage it presumes that most developing countries cannot achieve the sdgs with their own limited fiscal resources and increasingly scarce donor overseas development assistance oda bank prioritization of financial inclusion presumes that fintech powered digital financial inclusion would increase growth create jobs and promote entrepreneurship in developing countries the mfd purports to respond to the g20 s april 2017 principles of mdbs strategy for crowding in private sector finance for growth and sustainable development the g20 has offered the roadmap to infrastructure as an asset class for energy transport and water inter alia the 2017 mfd strategy recycled the bank s 2015 billions to trillions transforming development finance arguing that mdbs should increase financial leverage via securitization to catalyse private investment thus promoting capital markets by transforming bankable projects into liquid securities the mfd presumes that public money should mainly be used to leverage private finance particularly institutional investments to finance the purported us 5 trillion sdg funding gap financialization coalition the mfd strategy seeks to enable financialization and transition to securities based financial systems in developing countries complementing other initiatives by the bank imf and g20 such initiatives are expected to encourage investors to use environmental social and governance criteria to attract mobilize and sustain needed financing the mfd presumes that public money should mainly be used to leverage private finance particularly institutional investments to finance the funding gap government guarantees are deemed necessary to de risk projects especially for public private partnerships ppps meanwhile the international finance corporation ifc a bank subsidiary is helping subsidize capital market involvement in infrastructure development the mfd strategy envisages capital markets in green bonds social impact bonds infrastructure bonds and so on securities markets are supposed to enable institutional investors to make desirable social and environmental impacts mfd advocates claim that capital markets provide new solutions to development challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and poor access to schooling clean water sanitation and housing the financial stability board has also proposed measures to transform shadow banking into securities based finance while the european commission s sustainable finance initiative seeks to similarly reorient institutional investors and asset managers cascading financialization the bank s cascade approach seeks to institutionalize this bias for private financing it seeks to facilitate securities lending by enabling repo market financing and hedging and rehypothecation i e allowing securities to be used repeatedly for new lending the cascade approach seeks to accelerate financialization with measures to accommodate new asset classes enable banks to engage in securities and derivatives markets with minimal regulation deregulate financial institutions creating tradable assets from ppp projects and facilitate capital flows ostensibly for development it presumes market imperfections and missing markets deter the private sector from financing sustainable development projects and proposes to address such bottlenecks by internalizing externalities and providing subsidies and guarantees to de risk investments tito cordella notes that it prioritizes private finance even when a project is likely to be profitable if undertaken with public funds he notes the tensions between maximizing private financing and optimizing financing for development and some implications public options are only to be considered after all private options are exhausted or fail thus the cascade approach presumes that the private sector is always more efficient despite actual experiences clearly it not only reflects an ideological preference for private finance but also seeks to promote securities and derivatives markets as market liquidity is among the core g20 principles of mdbs strategy for crowding in private sector finance hijacking development finance the strategy would thus commit scarce public resources to de risking such financing arrangements to transform bankable development projects into tradable assets this means that governments will bear more of the likely costs of greater financial fragility and crises such government measures will inadvertently undermine needed financial institutions such as development banks there is no reason to believe that mfd will somehow create the capital market infrastructure to improve finance for smes or needed development transformations once a project s future revenue streams are securitized the multilateral development banks environmental and social safeguards no longer apply contracts to repay securitized debt held by investors would be disconnected from the underlying project financed and its consequences holders of these securities have no incentives to prioritize social or environmental goals private equity and hedge funds that have short term incentives for profit taking including by asset stripping are not concerned with social environmental or other public interests not surprisingly considerable doubt exists as to whether private capital markets and institutional investors can be incentivized to finance long term public goods as these mechanisms serve the profit motive not public welfare anis chowdhury adjunct professor at western sydney university university of new south wales australia held

following results are presented on an adjusted basis 1 to include the company s share of its joint venture operations on a proportionate basis because this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance for a reconciliation to the results in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs refer to the reconciliation of ifrs to adjusted results as

operating decisions and performance evaluation ifrs does not allow for the inclusion of joint ventures on a proportionate basis these results include additional non ifrs measure such as ebitda and cash flow from operations before non recurring items the adjusted results are not generally accepted measure of financial performance under ifrs the company s method of calculating these financial performance measures may differ from other companies and accordingly they may not be comparable to measure used by other companies refer to the md a for a reconciliation of these non ifrs adjusted results financial performance glacier s results for the year reflected the continued progress being made in the key business information growth initiatives as well as the evolution of the community media business it is important to note that digital and data products and services command higher business valuations than print products so the company can grow overall profit and value with lower consolidated revenues the overall level of revenue growth in the relevant operations for the year is all the more significant in this light glacier s adjusted 1 consolidated revenue was 222 6 million for the year down 1 4 adjusted consolidated ebitda was 22 1 million for the year down 23 6 from the prior year the overall financial results for the year were impacted by an accounting change in one of its operations two transactions and significant operating investment revenue and ebitda at specialty technical publishers stp were both reduced by 0 9 million due to a change in accounting reflecting the transition in operations to a solely digital subscription based business the change coincides with operational changes being made at stp including the phasing out of the paper versions of the product and results in revenue being deferred over the term of the subscription contracts the change will also impact the monthly revenues recognized going forward into the first six months of 2019 in addition the adjusted consolidated results were impacted by two transactions that affected the comparability of the results 1 the sale of the comprehensive oilfield service and supply database cossd which was last published by the company in june 2017 and 2 the purchase of the remaining interest in infomine resulting in infomine s results being consolidated into the company s results as of april 2018 together these two transactions resulted in a net revenue increase of 2 0 million and a net ebitda decrease of 0 9 million as compared to the prior year excluding these one time items glacier s adjusted consolidated revenue was 221 5 million for the year down 1 9 and adjusted consolidated ebitda was 23 9 million for the year down 5 1 million or 17 5 from the prior year the decline in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to increased operating investments made in some of the key strategic initiatives including the rew real estate portal agriculture show expansion new weather and agricultural markets subscription based products mining data and intelligence information products and new digital community media products in total the company s adjusted ebitda was reduced 5 1 million as a result of the 0 92 million stp accounting change and 4 2 million of operating expense investment in the specific areas indicated this does not include other additional ongoing operating expenses that are being incurred to deliver on the company s growth strategies additional capital expenditure investment was also made in the same areas these investments are being made to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the company s markets that require timely action to be taken the growth in revenues being achieved and the demand for the company s products this reflects underscores the fact that the investments are working and value is being created the transformation of the business is progressing approximately two thirds of the company s business information revenue now comes from data digital products and events and only one third comes from print advertising revenue of the data digital products and event revenue approximately 85 comes from data and digital product revenue and 15 comes from events this mix compares to approximately one third data digital products and events revenue and two thirds print advertising revenue five years ago within the business information operations highlights and operational overview business information environmental property and financial segment the environmental property and financial segment grew 4 0 in adjusted revenue adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 30 2 as a result of 1 the change in accounting for stp and 2 the operating investments made in key growth areas particularly rew ca and eris excluding the adjustment at stp adjusted revenue was up 7 0 and adjusted ebitda was down 18 9 for the environmental property and financial segment eris experienced strong growth in both canada and the u s with significant new customer additions and renewals including new mid sized customers in the u s market revenue grew 14 7 as a result and profitability grew as well despite the continued investment being made in people and product development rew ca the company s online real estate portal continued to grow in terms of site features traffic and revenues rew ca is now the 1 real estate site in the lower mainland and victoria in terms of traffic according to comscore traffic in toronto grew rapidly in the year revenue continued to grow despite the slower real estate conditions in the vancouver and toronto markets weaker market conditions often increase the need for developers and realtors to advertise and invest in lead generation in order to sell homes commodities segment the commodities segment s total adjusted revenue grew 2 0 for the year adjusted ebitda for the year fell by 4 7 due to the continued softness of the energy and mining markets and the ongoing operational investments excluding the purchase of infomine and the sale of the cossd commodity information adjusted revenue decreased by 1 5 and adjusted ebitda increased 3 9 conditions in the agricultural markets appear to have stabilized but uncertainty from trade disputes and the consolidation of major crop input companies persists the company continued to invest in its agricultural information operations in key growth areas such as outdoor shows and online listings which resulted in improved operation performance in particular for both agdealer and ag in motion the energy group continued to reap the benefits of the substantial restructurings enacted over the last two years the energy information group is now focused on 1 data analytics and intelligence products and 2 digital media these products continued to experience stable revenue versus the prior year despite continuing soft market conditions stabilized revenues and the restructurings resulted in a substantial increase in ebitda for 2018 compared to the prior year the company s mining operations the northern miner and infomine operated in choppy market conditions the northern miner grew revenues and profit and hosted two very successful conferences the canadian mining symposium may 2018 in london england and the progressive mine forum september 2018 in toronto having purchased the remaining interest in infomine the company operationally merged its mining operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 this will result in cost efficiencies and new revenue opportunities in 2019 community media community media print advertising revenues continued to decline as anticipated while digital revenues grew substantially the 4 0 overall adjusted revenue decline for the community media business was lower than previous years total community media adjusted revenue declined 13 5 in 2016 and 6 6 in 2017 as a result of strong digital performance digital revenue grew 46 3 for the year it is becoming apparent that a viable long term digital community media business model exists where the company can leverage its broad presence in local markets across western canada and offer local websites digital marketing services and specialty digital products the company is investing in the digital business by hiring and training to broaden our skills and experience base in line with market needs and opportunities as well as product and services development the investment is working as traffic is growing revenue is growing and profitability is growing customer retention levels are high which indicates the digital products and services being offered are working for our clients digital traffic is being monetized effectively and the actual dollar size of the digital solutions being sold is growing and attractive compared to print advertising which was not historically the case outlook the company is at an attractive juncture where it has meaningful growth opportunities in each of its sectors with which to increase value and is achieving market traction in each one the agriculture energy mining commercial and residential real estate and financial markets are large addressable markets that offer significant opportunities for both data analytics intelligence offerings as well as content marketing solutions the evolution of the media business one meaningful change for the company s prospects is that the digital community media business is evolving in a manner that now offers significant growth and value creation opportunity the company s digital community media operations are growing steadily in audience size revenue and profitability the company s balance of effort and strategic focus is working the progress being made is translating into new product delivery customer satisfaction and revenue generation the agriculture market is stable and glacier farmmedia continues to have a variety of growth opportunities to pursue including digital media digital marketing services online equipment listings shows weather and other premium subscription products while the mining market has slowed somewhat and energy remains soft revenue opportunities exist to grow revenues in a variety of areas including data and information subscription products as well as shows and events the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to offer opportunity for eris and rew ca while some of the company s markets are experiencing slowdowns in residential real estate activity as stated softer real estate markets often represent a greater need for realtor and developer advertising and lead generation depending on the level of slowdown while print advertising declines are expected to continue in community media digital revenue and profits are growing significantly and are providing a greater level of offset to the print revenue declines it is also apparent that good print products still offer good value to readers and advertisers and provide cash flow to fund the company s growth initiatives importantly it now appears that a viable digital community media business model exists where we may be able to preserve the value of the existing print community media business with lower revenue but a more valuable digital business as outlined the company plans to continue to invest in its key strategic areas the investments are critical to the company s growth plan and are resulting in demonstrable value creation given the uncertain north american and global economic conditions that exist and the stage of transformation some of the company s businesses are in the company will operate cautiously but believes continued investment is necessary for long term value creation cost efficiency opportunities continue to be pursued where possible to help manage

company glacier media inc is an information marketing solutions company pursuing growth in sectors where the provision of essential information and related services provides high customer utility and value glacier s strategy is implemented through two operational areas content and marketing solutions and data analytics and intelligence financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with international financial reporting standards glacier uses certain non ifrs measures that may be different from the performance measures used by other companies these non ifrs measures include cash flow from operations before changes in non cash operating accounts and non recurring items earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda and all adjusted measures which are not alternatives to ifrs financial measures management focuses on cash flow from operations before non recurring items per share as the primary measure of operating profitability free cash flow and value ebitda per share is also an important measure as the company has low ongoing capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization largely relates to acquisition goodwill and copyrights and does not represent a corresponding sustaining capital expense these non ifrs measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by ifrs and accordingly they are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the adjusted consolidated financial results have been adjusted to include the company s share of revenue expenses assets and liabilities from its joint venture operations on a proportionate accounting basis as this is the basis on which management bases its operating decisions and performance evaluation ifrs does not allow for the inclusion of the joint ventures on a proportionate basis these results include additional non ifrs measures such as ebitda and cash flow from operations before non recurring items

28 03 2019 growth across the world slows further and further despite predictions to the contrary says michael roberts the long depression is still very much with us this week the us federal reserve bank decided to stop raising its policy interest rate for the rest of 2019 the fed started hiking rates from near zero back in late 2016 on the grounds that the long depression in economic growth investment and employment in the us and in other major economies was over as economies reached full employment and used up excess capacity in industry it was argued wages rises and price inflation would accelerate so it would be necessary to curb any overheating with higher interest rates to slow borrowing and spending this policy of normalisation as it is called seemed to be justified after donald trump s tax cuts were introduced in late 2017 those measures led to a sharp rise in after tax profits for us corporations and an apparent pick up in us real gdp growth reaching a 3 year on year rate at the end of 2018 all looked well however as i argued back in spring 2018 the global economy had actually peaked and now nearly one year later forecasts for a continued recovery have been reversed a year ago the fed had raised its real gdp growth forecast for the whole of 2018 to 2 7 and 2 4 for 2019 but now at its march 2019 meeting it has lowered its forecast for 2019 to 2 1 and 1 9 for 2020 with a further slowdown to just 1 8 in 2021 well below the boasted 3 plus that trump claims his tax measures would achieve permanently so now the fed is stopping its rate hiking and also ending its monetary tightening policy of running down its huge holdings of government bonds that it had built up as part of the quantitative easing programme launched in the great recession to save the banks and provide cheap money for investment what is happening well it always was a risk that hiking interest rates when economic growth and investment were weak would cause a stock market collapse and a new economic slump now with us economic growth in the current quarter likely to be no more than at a 1 5 annual rate and the euro zone the uk and japan slipping back towards outright recession the fed has taken fright and put its normalisation policy into cold storage so the long depression is not over after all the most startling difference however between the long depression and the great depression of the 1930s is that in the last decade in the major economies the official unemployment rate has dropped back to near record lows in the us uk japan and yet inflation has not spiralled upwards at all the trade off between low unemployment and high inflation as shown by the so called phillips curve ratio of the unemployment rate to the inflation rate is a hallmark prediction of keynesian aggregate demand theory but it has not materialised the phillips curve is nearly flat in most capitalist economies there is little trade off this is confounding mainstream economic thought and the policies of central banks as i previously outlined i don t feel we have convincingly achieved our 2 mandate in a symmetrical way said fed chair jay powell it s one of the major challenges of our time to have downward pressure on inflation low wage what seems to have happened is that in the wake of the great recession in an environment of low profitability on capital in most major economies companies have opted to take on more labour rather than invest the new labour entrants are being employed in low wage occupations and or on temporary and part time contracts for example 17 of american workers are employed only on a part time basis one third more than in the 1960s the us official unemployment rate may be down but that is partly because many americans of working age have disappeared from the labour market to study work informally or just live at home with the family and there has been a rise in self employment in the so called gig economy so while skilled workers in short supply have begun to experience wage rises the bulk of the non management workforce in the us the uk japan and europe have seen instead significant periods of falling real earnings while the average real gdp growth rate per person in the us has been about 1 5 since 2009 average hourly real earnings for most us workers have risen only 0 8 a year thus there has been no wage push inflation and average real incomes have stagnated the capitalist sector has not increased investment in new machinery plant or technology to a level that would lead to replacing labour or boosting the productivity of the existing workforce whereas in the great depression of the 1930s unemployment remained high up to the start of world war ii while productivity rose sharply the opposite is the case in this long depression the latest estimate of global capital investment made by jp morgan economists suggests that investment orders are falling and imports of capital goods have moved into negative territory in contrast the us stock market is heading to new highs we are now in an economic world where there appears to be a sort of full employment but stagnant real wages for most low interest rates and inflation and above all low productive investment meanwhile corporate debt is rising fast globally as major companies issue bonds at low rates of interest in order to buy back their own shares and thus boost the company s stock price and continue the party the long depression has become a fantasy world of rising financial asset prices low investment and productivity growth where nearly everybody can get a job working part time temporary or self employed but not a living michael roberts blogs at notes

president and chief executive officer thank you alan good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our increased guidance for the current year the momentum we experienced throughout the year continued in q4 and we are pleased to have finished the year strong our financial results and over achievement reflects the successful execution of the growth strategy we implemented approximately two years ago which we have discussed on prior calls this was another year of accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins with earnings growing faster than revenue our annual results on a gaap basis were 1 23 billion of revenue and 1 diluted net income per share on a non gaap basis we achieved revenue of 1 245 billion and diluted net income per share of 3 21 we delivered a 14 increase in non gaap earnings with nearly two points of operating margin expansion cash from operations also came in very strong at 250 million a 22 increase year over year as that momentum continues we are raising guidance once again for the current year our guidance for the non gaap revenue is increasing by 25 million to 1 37 billion representing 10 growth and acceleration from the prior year we are also increasing our guidance for non gaap eps by 0 10 the 3 60 representing 12 year over year growth let me take a step back and discuss how we have created such strong momentum over the last several years our customers and the market at large have expressed mounting business and security challenges and we ve responded by infusing more automation innovation into our actionable intelligence platform we believe that increasing our pace of automation and cloud innovation has further differentiated verint as the vendor of choice in our markets we now estimate the size of the actionable intelligence markets to be at approximately 10 billion and growing at a double digit rate verint is one of the industry s strongest research and development teams focused on actionable intelligence with about 2 000 in r d out of total 6 000 professionals we are innovating at an increasingly rapid pace our intellectual property is backed by close to 1 000 patents and applications worldwide of course data capture unstructured data analytics artificial intelligence and automation demonstrating our increased focus on automation just over the last 24 months we have filed for 150 patents related to automation our actionable intelligence platform service the technology foundation for our broad portfolio across customer engagement and cyber intelligence we believe the strength of our platform and the investments we ve made in automation and cloud are behind our momentum and positive outlook now i would like to review our results by segments starting with customer engagements total revenue for the year was 811 million on a non gaap basis representing a 7 5 increase year over year we are pleased with our customer engagement momentum and expect revenue growth to accelerate again in the current year to 10 our strategy is to help organizations simplify modernize and automate customer engagements to address two important business challenges we believe these challenges has escalated and have become increasingly critical over the last couple of years emerging as top priorities for organizations to address the first challenge is that today people demand better customer engagement and express organizations to make improvements to elevate their customer experience increasingly organizations are recognizing this need and are looking for cost effective ways to respond a recent poll showed that 71 of boardrooms consider customer experience to be their top metric another poll showed that 81 of cmos expect to compete and differentiate based on customer experience a much larger percentage than just a few years ago the second challenge is that digital transformation is driving an increase in the number of customer interactions causing organizations to hire and expand their workforce leading to unsustainable cost increases according to industry research the number of interactions is currently growing by more than 60 per year and there are already tens of millions of people employed globally in customer service functions with workforce cost exceeding 1 trillion annually historically initiatives that we re focused primarily on customer experience often resulted in increased operating costs and initiatives that we re focused primarily on efficiencies often resulted in poor customer experience more than ever before organizations are focused on balancing these challenges innovating customer experience and at the same time reducing operating costs we believe the market is at an inflection point looking for new technology to address these escalating challenges based on our customers inputs we identified this critical industry challenges early and started to infuse automation throughout our portfolio in response we leveraged our actionable intelligence platform combined with the strong customer engagement expertise and today we deliver significant roi for our customers across the enterprise our portfolio helps organizations elevate customer experience while reducing operating costs and with automation across enterprise to many functions including contact centers back office operations digital and mobile marketing as well as security and compliance our software makes employees more productive enables an emerging hybrid workforce in which humans and robots work together supports more interactions to be handled via self service captures the voice of the customer distilling it into actionable insights and automates fraud and compliance functions overall we believe that our simplified modernized and automated strategy is differentiated and can drive double digit revenue growth in customer engagements over the long run turning to cloud i m pleased to report that our cloud growth rates have accelerated we ended the fourth quarter with 200 million of cloud arr on a non gaap basis representing a year over year increase of approximately 40 based on this strong momentum we expect cloud revenue in the current year to increase more than 40 this will drive our cloud revenue to nearly 250 million for the year behind this acceleration is increased market cloud adoption and the strength of the verint cloud our cloud strategy is to help customers transition to the cloud at their own pace our entire customer engagement portfolio is offered in a hybrid cloud model for maximum customer flexibility and scales from smb to very large enterprise customer it s important to note that the 250 million of cloud revenue we expect this year will be generated predominantly from new customers or new cloud deployments just recently our customers have began to explore the conversion of their verint customer engagement on premise solution to the cloud such conversion could result in a significant revenue uplift for verint as a dollar of maintenance revenue can convert to cloud revenue at a 2x rates we currently generate over 300 million of maintenance revenue per year and future conversion to cloud presents a significant opportunity for increased revenue and profitability based on our cloud leadership increased market cloud adoption the level of growth we have recently achieved and the potential for our installed base to migrate to the cloud we re targeting strong cloud growth over the next three years with the cagr of 30 to 40 turning to our customer base we have more than 10 000 customers including more than 85 of the fortune 100 our strong customer relationships drive high renewal rates and the opportunity to land and expand with our broad and growing portfolio during the quarter we ve received many large orders from existing customer and new customers including many competitive displacements reflecting our strategy to help customers simplify modernize and automate here are few highlights of recent customer wins a 6 million cloud order from a leading travel management company looking to modernize customer engagement by moving from several on premises point solutions to the verint cloud this large order was a competitive displacements and we believe we were selected due to the strength of our cloud solutions and strong automation innovation a 6 million order from a leading utilities company this customer decided to deploy itself to our solutions on premises and some in the cloud taking advantage of our flexible hybrid cloud model a 5 million order from a leading financial services company looking to infuse more automation into its operations this was another competitive displacements and we believe we were selected due to our automation differentiation a 2 million cloud order from a leading ridesharing ph company looking to manage its rapidly growing workforce we believe we were selected due to our ability to address business challenges across the enterprise including call centers back office operations and branches with a global cloud deployments a 2 million cloud order from a leading financial services company looking to gain customer experience insights this was another competitive displacement and we believe we were selected due to our ability to capture and analyze voice of the customer across many channels and finally i would like to highlight another q4 win which reflects our strong customer relationship and the success of our land and expand strategy this leading telecommunications company gave us total of 20 million in orders in the year of which a 7 million order came in in q4 in addition to our success in the enterprise market today we generate around 15 of our customer engagement revenue from smb customers over the last several years we ve invested in our smb portfolio and today we offer smb customers a purpose built cloud solution designed to address their preferences for ease of deployments and ease of use in addition we expanded our partner program with a growing sets of cloud partners that sell our product to both smb and enterprise customers verint partners benefit from our communication infrastructure neutrality open system approach and our strong domain expertise overall we are pleased with our strong finish to the year particularly with our cloud acceleration we re also pleased to be in a position to raise guidance in the current year as well as provide a three year outlook for strong cloud growth turning to cyber intelligence total non gaap revenue for the year was 434 million representing a 10 increase year over year we are pleased with our continued momentum and expect to deliver another year of 10 growth we re also pleased with the 2 margin expansion we achieved last year and will discuss a long term targets for cyber intelligence margin expansion later in the call we live in the world where security threats are becoming more pervasive and complex at the same time data volumes are growing rapidly making legacy data mining tools less effective as a result security organizations are seeking more advanced data mining software to better detect investigate and neutralize threats we believe the cyber intelligence addressable market size is about 4 billion and the ongoing demand for advanced data mining software provides the sustained double digit growth opportunity our strategy is to introduce advanced data mining software that can further automate the intelligence and shorten the investigative processes for our customers while reducing dependency on large numbers of intelligence analysts and data scientists today we offer organizations a broad solution portfolio across three security domains cyber intelligence cybersecurity and situational intelligence in cyber intelligence we help law enforcement and national security organizations capture a large amount of data from a variety of sources and turn it into actionable intelligence to help prevent crime and terror in cybersecurity we help government s cyber authorities an enterprise c source capture network and endpoint data and identify malware and cyber attacks and in situation intelligence we help governments and enterprises capture a large amount of data from devices and databases and deliver actionable insights to protect people and assets our customer base in cyber intelligence is growing last year we added 100 new customers and we now have more than 1 000 customers globally across government and enterprise today government customers represents approximately 80 of our cyber intelligence revenue we provide our data mining software to diversified set of 400 government agencies across more than 100 countries we have long standing relationship with customers around the world and a significant portion of our cyber intelligence revenue comes from repeat business the remaining 20 of our revenue comes from enterprise customers we have 600 enterprise customers across many verticals such as telecom service providers financial services retail and critical infrastructure including many large companies who are leaders in their industries in q4 we continue to win many large deals around the world including recently receiving an order of close to 20 million two orders around 15 million each and three orders in excess of 5 million each we believe our success in winning these large deals in q4 is due to our ability to anticipate market trends and quickly bring innovative solutions to markets we believe the combination of our leadership position and strong market demand for advanced data mining software will enable us to continue to grow revenue at a double digit rate supporting our outlook in an expanding customer base across governments and enterprises providing us strong visibility as previously discussed we re executing a plan for significant margin expansion in our cyber intelligence segment and i m pleased to report on our progress and outlook over the last two years we have invested to transition the business to a more software model we have already achieved 3 margin improvement over the last two years and expect our margins to continue to expand this year as our revenue shift to more software and less pass through hardware over the next three years we are targeting an additional 5 margin expansion driving our cyber intelligence adjusted ebitda margins to more than 20 overall we are pleased with the execution of our cyber intelligence strategy driving strong revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion before turning the call over to doug i would like to summarize as follows we believe our strong results and over achievement reflects the successful execution of the growth strategy we launched approximately two years ago with this strategy we are accelerating our pace of innovation to further differentiate verint in a market that is increasingly embracing actionable intelligence solutions we are experiencing strong momentum driven by automation and cloud adoption and finally we believe that our addressable market is growing at a double digit rates and that we are well positioned for sustained growth and market leadership and now let me turn the call over to doug douglas robinson chief financial officer yeah thanks dan and good afternoon everyone our discussion today will include non gaap financial measures a reconciliation between our gaap to non gaap financial measures is available as alan mentioned in our earnings release and in the ir section of our website differences between our gaap and non gaap financial measures include adjustments related to acquisitions including fair value revenue adjustments amortization of acquisition related intangibles certain other acquisition related expenses stock based compensation as well as certain other items that can vary significantly in amount and frequency i ll start my discussion today reviewing our fiscal 2019 performance and then talk about what we re expecting for fiscal 2020 we finished the year with solid momentum and had strength across the business each of the quarters built upon one before and we are well positioned going into the new year for the full year we generated 1 245 billion of non gaap revenue up 8 from the prior year we experienced strong growth in both of our segments with 811 million of non gaap revenue in customer engagement up approximately 7 5 year over year and 434 million of non gaap revenue in cyber intelligence up approximately 10 from last year we achieved expansion of our gross margins with full year non gaap gross margins of 66 6 about a point higher compared to last year we ve experienced that expansion in both segments with cyber intelligence full year gross margins expanding 2 points for the year our non gaap operating income increased 18 year over year to 267 million driving an operating margin of 21 4 and approximately 2 point expansion our objective has been to grow earnings at a rate greater than revenue and we re very pleased with the operating margin improvement we experienced for the year our adjusted ebitda for the year was almost 300 million up 16 from last year this performance drove diluted non gaap eps of 3 21 for the year compared to 2 81 in the prior year a 14 year over year increase we are pleased with the earnings leverage we re achieving as we work to expand our gross margins in both segments and also in achieving some cost efficiencies with our operating expenses with respect to the balance sheet at the end of q4 we had 468 million of cash and short term investments including short term and long term restricted cash and investments we had very strong cash flow from operations on a gaap basis in q4 of 84 million resulting in 250 million of gaap cash from operations for the full year a 22 increase from last year the strong year over year increase in gaap cash flow from operations also demonstrates the positive business and earnings momentum we re achieving and speaks to the overall health of the business we ended the quarter with net debt of 351 million including long term restricted cash and investments and excluding discounts and issuance cost primarily associated with our convertible debt when we look at our fiscal ended 2019 results you can see the tremendous progress we ve made over the last three years in terms of revenue and earnings growth looking to fiscal year ending 2020 we see that momentum continuing and are raising guidance to 1 37 billion of revenue plus or minus 2 and 3 60 earnings per share at the midpoint both on a non gaap basis i would now like to provide you some new metrics to help you understand the momentum we re experiencing starting with customer engagement in customer engagement in fiscal 2020 we expect revenue growth of about 10 on a non gaap basis this is a higher rate of growth than we ve experienced in the past several years driven in part by an acceleration in our cloud business we expect our cloud revenue to increase more than 40 approaching 250 million overall we expect close to 900 million of non gaap revenue in customer engagement for fiscal 2020 with the majority of our revenue coming from three sources cloud maintenance and contract is already in place as of the beginning of the year these three components represent about 70 of the annual revenue we expect to achieve and provides us good visibility into the year with respect to margins we believe margins will continue to expand in customer engagement and expect an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 28 5 for the year in cyber intelligence in fiscal 2020 we expect revenue growth of around 10 with continuing margin expansion as we continue to shift to more of a software model overall we expect around 475 million of revenue with the majority of our revenue coming from contracts we already had in place at the beginning of the year maintenance and some subscription these three components also represent about 70 of the annual revenue we expect to achieve providing us good visibility into the year at this guidance level we expect an adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 16 5 before going to q a i d like to provide some additional input for your fiscal 2020 models we expect our non gaap quarterly interest and other expense excluding the potential impact of foreign exchange to be approximately 5 7 million given volatility and foreign exchange rates there could be future gains or losses related to balance sheet translations in our future results which are not included in our guidance we expect our non gaap tax rate to be approximately 11 for the year reflecting the amount of cash taxes we expect to pay this year and for share count we expect to have approximately 67 5 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full year in addition to our annual guidance we d like to provide some color on the progression of the year for modeling purposes for non gaap revenue in q1 we expect revenue to increase around 8 year over year to 315 million we expect sequential increases in q2 and q3 followed by our usual of seasonally strong q4 relative to margins we expect earnings per share to increase approximately 14 year over year to around 0 60 in the first quarter driven by continued margin expansion when we look beyond the current year we are targeting sustained double digit revenue growth and margin expansion over the next three years in customer engagement growth will be fueled by growing our cloud revenue which we are targeting at 30 to 40 cagr which will enable us to double our cloud business in less than three years and in cyber intelligence growth will be driven by demand for data mining solutions and the transition to a software model which we are targeting it will take our cyber intelligence adjusted ebitda margins to above 20 in conclusion we will leave demand for our actionable intelligence solutions to remain strong and we continue to execute well on our growth strategy with a focus on automation and cloud with the momentum of our customer engagement cloud business and the need for innovative data mining software in our cybersecurity business we feel we are well positioned and are pleased to be raising revenue guidance to 10 growth with another year of expanding margins so with that operator can we please open up the lines for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from andy miller of jefferies your line is now open samad samana jefferies analyst hi good afternoon this is actually samad samana from jefferies thanks for taking my questions today congrats on a great quarter and strong close to the year and impressive i think we are most impressed by the cloud revenue size and the growth forecast that the company gave there and dan i was just wondering if maybe you could help us understand what the drivers of that high revenue growth are first for new customer additions versus maintenance conversion and how we should think about the cadence of that opportunity and i m also just curious if there is any incentives or any sales with the sales organization to drive that very impressive cloud growth and then i have a follow up question daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yes yes thank you i ll be happy to explain on cloud so as we ve discussed prior calls enterprise customers have been interested in a move to the cloud and what we ve seen lately is that they ve accelerated the cloud adoption and cloud purchases so what we expect this year 250 million in cloud revenue is predominantly from new deployments so either new customers or deployments to existing customers but the main is conversion basically has not started yet we had a handful of customers that converted maintenance revenue into cloud and we expect our maintenance revenue grew last year we actually expect maintenance revenue to grow this year as well but we think that the conversion is about to begin but our growth this year we have expect more than 40 with very little maintenance conversion so it s all new deployments and it s really fueled by our readiness and the market readiness so i think the smb market is obviously adopted cloud faster and i spoke about what we re doing for smb customers and we see that as a growth opportunity but we see more adoption also at the high end of the market for larger enterprise customers so let me explain more why we feel very strong about our ability to address the customer needs and to help them move to the customer with their own pace we have a differentiated offering in cloud that is spacing that based on four factors one is very broad portfolio that is all available in the cloud and the sales force is leading with saas first at the same time we have a hybrid cloud model to give customers maximum flexibility and as i mentioned in some of the large wins that i discussed today we have customers that s clearly prefer to deploy some of our solutions in the cloud and some on prem and they can actually deploy verint solution on the verint cloud they can deploy it on the partner cloud or they can deploy it on the cloud or own prem or any combination and that s a great strength we also offer a very strong feature priority between on prem and cloud which make it easier to customers to move from on prem to cloud and all these are really really strong differentiated cloud capabilities in addition i mentioned few customer wins where we have global deployments so we are able to deliver cloud in many countries and you re dealing with all of the data privacy and the need to have data centers in different geographies and we have deployed across the globe and our offering also scaled from smb all the way up to the enterprise so i think that very strong offering we believe that we are today the largest cloud vendor in our market and remember we don t sell communication infrastructure products so we ve built a scale to be the largest and we also believe that we are the best vendor to provide customers clouds at the pace of our customer needs so samad samana jefferies analyst i think it s very helpful daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah go ahead samad samana jefferies analyst maybe just one follow up as you mentioned the company has a really broad cloud portfolio and we think that s one of the things that s driving new business and new wins i m curious if there s which areas within that portfolio of cloud are particularly in the hybrid environment which ones are the most popular to put in the cloud versus the ones that are being kept on premise daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer so i think it s really more by enterprise function again we sell across the enterprise contact center back office digital mobile marketing and so on marketing solution we sell to marketing usually have very very high cloud adoption already well the solution in the operation typically large customers tend to do it slower so it s not so much by product it s more by adoption of the market depends more on the market function and also how much it really wants to move and modernize the organization but we are ready across our portfolio and we see good traction with basically all our products moving to the cloud i want to mention also just one more thing just to have a complete response on the cloud dynamics that the maintenance conversion that is still ahead of us we have seen opportunity to get a great revenue uplift because a conversion could be typically at the 2x rate because we basically are helping our customers not just to move the license from on prem to cloud but also to host the software for our clients and we have a very efficient hosting infrastructure that is more efficient to clients which creates a great opportunity for them to save money while moving to the cloud and at the same time we get a revenue uplift and also increased profitability samad samana jefferies analyst great that s very helpful thanks again and congrats on a great quarter daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gabriela borges of goldman sachs your line is now open gabriela borges goldman sachs analyst great good afternoon thanks for taking my question and for all the incremental detail on the cloud opportunity i had a sit down for doug maybe help us understand the implication for your typical perpetual license sale i m just wondering how we gauge the dynamic where if incremental growth is coming on via cloud how do we avoid a scenario of perpetual license falls off more rapidly and you get a little bit of air pocket in the p l thanks douglas robinson chief financial officer yeah sure we see this is being migration we expect a lot of customers will continue along with some perpetual licenses at the same time other customers are doing more on cloud but we ve modeled that in we have some scenarios if we look at in terms of conversion rates and we feel comfortable we can absorb any fall off the perpetual license with the growth we have in the cloud going forward daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah in the same time we have better margins on cloud than on our on prem so we have built at scale to what do we expect this year of 250 million actually it was margin expansion if you look at the last couple of years while we are building a cloud business we also are improving our gross margins and we talked in the past about the fact that you know an on prem implementation is software license and professional services and that s us implementation multi tenant size comes with margin of 80 so the more our customers move to the cloud we will expect to see continued margin expansion gabriela borges goldman sachs analyst that s very helpful thank you and a follow up is on the cyber intelligence business maybe just give us a little bit of a sense of how customers are thinking about spending over the course of the year and the type of visibility that you have into that business relative to prior years thanks daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so our visibility is strong we entered the year with approximately 70 of the expected revenue that we have visibility and that s pretty similar to last year but of course we are expecting another 10 growth this year so visibility of 70 is strong and it s been our experience over the last couple of years where we were driving double digit growth i think the curse with the market is large is clearly demanding a more advanced data mining software we have customers that are embedded with data and they needs the data mining software to be able to make sense of the data i can give you an example of the cybersecurity customer that reported to us after we implemented our software in their soc security operating center that they were able to cut the investigation time from one week to four hours in average and you know that the problem in the soc today there is a lot of alerts that require cyber analyst to follow up on these alerts investigate and find out if these are just false alarms or real malware and the ability to use data mining software and accelerates the investigation and achieve acceleration of one week to four hours obviously leads to being able to make the cyber analysis much more effective in protecting the organization so there is an ongoing demand we believe it s a double digit growth opportunity the market is growing double digit and we are well positioned with a strong portfolio to grow at that pace gabriela borges goldman sachs analyst i appreciate the detail thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from daniel ives of wedbush securities your line is now open daniel ives wedbush securities analyst yeah thank you and congrats again so maybe you could just talk about the cloud transition in terms on call center what you re seeing how the conversations changed with customers especially over the last three to six months versus where you were a year ago thanks daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer i think the sales force is still giving our customers the flexibility to choose the deployment that they prefer from that perspective i think we continue to be neutral to customer preferences but as we just see acceleration in customer adoption in the enterprise area and in smb i think what change is that we invested in creating more purpose built solution for smb so we took a product downstream we made an easier to deploy and easier to use and leveraging a growing ecosystem of partners cloud partners i think we are better positioned to address the strong demand for cloud in the smb space so acceleration for us in both areas and with our own strength and the ability to be very efficient with delivering these solutions we re also very competitive in terms of price and in terms of the features security quality all the cloud features that are important to our customers in addition to the functionality of the application daniel ives wedbush securities analyst got it okay and when you re thinking even from a recurring revenue from visibility just given what s going on the model how should we think about that from like an arr perspective increased visibility maybe in the model that we re seeing over the next 12 to 18 months should we use to measure that or otherwise we should think about the business from a high level in terms of that visibility stream douglas robinson chief financial officer so no yeah you can certainly measure that we have recurring revenue of approximately 60 and improving from last year and with the cloud acceleration that we see and we gave a cagr of 30 to 40 over the next three years our recurring revenue would be approaching 70 so we believe that some enterprise customers we still prefer on prem deployments but we clearly think that we are moving with much faster growth in cloud over the next few years that will improve recurring revenue and again we think that this growth will partially come for maintenance conversion but that s going to take some time and we certainly see a lot of new deployments as we saw so far that will be cloud deployments and of course if the maintenance conversion is going to happen faster then we have an upside opportunity operator thank you and our next question comes from hugh cunningham of oppenheimer your line is now open hugh cunningham oppenheimer analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question i want to beat this to death but on the cloud side it seems like the what we considered a concern about security on the cloud that concern on the part of your customers has gone away and i m wondering is there anything else that is holding customers back and then on your side it seems like you re maintaining sort of a neutral stand for your customers giving them what they want but are you going to maybe shift or tilt your approach a little bit in the future toward maybe pushing cloud more and then finally on the cyber side you ve seem so much more confident on cyber intelligence now and i think doug mentioned margins above 20 well i think it s three years out but margins ultimately above 20 did i hear that right and one i think that s higher than you used to talk about and then specifically on the cyber side what are you seeing in emerging markets are the emerging markets showing on continued signs of strength any concerns or what s happening there thanks daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer so yes you heard right the number 20 and of course those if you are able to see the slides on the webex i think we make it also very clear there but let me start with the cloud question and then we ll give some more details on cyber intelligence so in terms of market adoption in security there are as i mentioned before there are customers that we believe for many many years to come will still want to host solutions in their own data centers but because of security and other reasons so we don t think that 100 of our customers will transition to the cloud but we see obviously a growing number of customers are comfortable with the security levels that we offering and yes we have invested quite a bit in providing a high level of security to our customers over time so i think that pushing our customers is not a good idea but i think the customers don t want be pushed they want to be led to understand the benefits of cloud i think that we are able to show them that some of the concerns they have are no longer real concern and at the same time some of the quality and cost efficiencies that we ve introduced as we create more scale we re able to pass some of these saving also to our customers so i think we can help customers to get more comfortable in their journey to the cloud and do it faster but we don t really need to push them there these are very large companies and long standing customers we still have land and expand opportunity they re buying more of our portfolio and i think they really value that we are a trusted partner overall we just to kind of summarize on these points our projection for this year for more than 40 cloud growth would does not require further pushing of the customers it s really based on the strong arr that we ve finished the year and based on projection of continue to behave the same way and we believe that our cloud adoption will get better over time so hopefully that that answers the cloud question so now let s get some more details on cyber intelligence we are discussing today with more confidence the margin expansion because we ve made investments over the last two years to transition our product to software model and make it easier for our customers to buy the software and provide the hardware the hardware themselves go through integrators we ve mentioned before that this is both an investment that we need to make in our products but also it s market adoption and by now we spoke to a lot of our customers and explain to them the benefits and we see that they really like the direction we also have 3 margin expansion over the last two years and that s why we are comfortable to give today three year targets for additional margin expansion of 5 over the next three years so for the number 20 20 is we have finished the year with 15 5 ebitda margin in cyber intelligence and we expect to be over 20 within the next three years so that s the margin expansion it s really it s consistent with what we explained before that we used to sell hardware that our customers prefer to buy the software and the hardware together from verint and that we are in a transition to shift the past these past two hardware that really we don t make and we don t really in the business of filling hardware so we re shifting that away and that s replacing that with obviously higher margin software revenue that overall increase our gross margin and ebitda margin hugh cunningham oppenheimer analyst sure and you successfully executed a similar transaction i think or process on ce i might final part of my question dan was on the emerging markets daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yeah so we have a very diversified customer base now we mentioned that we added 100 customers last year more than 1 000 customers about 400 government agencies different government agencies so on average four agencies per country obviously some countries more some less but on the government side we feel it s quite diversified of course many agencies in many countries and then we have 600 customers in enterprise and enterprise is going faster so we are getting more scale and more densification in our cyber intelligence business we do not see any issues with emerging markets right now that cause us to be concerned and we face strong demand and strong pipeline across the world hugh cunningham oppenheimer analyst thank you dan operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff kessler of imperial capital your line is now open jeff kessler imperial capital analyst thank you i have a question here and i m going to get it out slowly because it s kind of complicated with the amount of new sensors that are out there either that range from highly sophisticated sensors at the high end down to do it yourself sensors at the residential level the amount of information and data that is going to responders as well as those who are out there to analyze this data is just growing at an exponential rate overwhelming the ability of at the home level police departments to respond and at the larger level obviously discussions with regard to civil public private partnerships and how much they can handle what are you doing and what opportunities do you see in the ability to provide responders with actionable intelligence whether it s at very low level or at the obviously at the high level where there has been some backup in civil security types of programs simply because they don t have either of the people or they don t have the budgets to handle the amount of data that they re dealing with daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer yes we refer to this as a data mining software for the iot internet of things because they are more and more like you said sensors devices but there is more and more devices connected to the internet that generates data and the ability to collect the iot data and apply data mining software which is basically analytics and automation is really at the core of trying to bring insights and do more security with fewer people so we have for example a global semiconductor company with facilities all over the world that recently became a customer for situational intelligence and in this case we are helping them to collect data from the iot and also fuse that data with their own databases that they have about their employees their vendors their access authorities into different parts of the facility and try to it will bring those insights to identify issues related to either people safety or protection of assets so the whole situation intelligence business i think is also an early stage opportunity for actionable intelligence and one that i think at this point just a leading the leading companies in their industries are starting to really adopt this and again for those of you look at the slides that we have in conjunction with this call and they will be obviously posted you can see that we list some of our cyber intelligence enterprise customers and they are very large companies and leaders in their industries jeff kessler imperial capital analyst okay a follow up to that is in the ability what is right now we see that there is probably about 13 14 hiring going on just for it personnel how are you particularly on the what i would call your cybersecurity it s going to call cyber cyber physical capabilities what are you doing to get more revenues out of larger customers and particularly in areas like critical infrastructure to protect to involve them in the you want to quote that physical nature of making sure that that compliance is dealt with in hipaa rules financial regs regarding protecting the cyber side of it how do you get extra revenues from helping them on the you want to quote the quasi physical area of making sure that data is secure daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer i think that a lot of these companies are building soc for physical security that are becoming more and more similar to the cybersecurity soc because they can have as you said they can hire people and have this people all over the place they want to bring the data into a centralized operating center and in that center they want to make the data into actionable insights and a force multiplier so they can do more with fewer people this is exactly the sweet spot for our actionable intelligence offering and the adoption of this technology i believe is still in the early stage in the physical security market but in our cyber intelligence business i mentioned that we are operating in three domains the cyber intelligence the cybersecurity and the situation intelligence and this opportunity that you re discussing jeff is around institution intelligence for physical security and critical infrastructure and we have a strong solution in this area as you know and i think this market adoption will see also acceleration of our growth rates in this domain jeff kessler imperial capital analyst so you re seeing this as the infancy of this area daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer i think this area was more focused on deploying people and sensors and devices and much less interested in advance data mining software i think that the governments and cybersecurity authorities were more advanced in understanding the power of intelligence and yes this is infancy in terms of the intelligence situation bringing intelligence into the situational awareness market what we call situation intelligence is still in an early stage jeff kessler imperial capital analyst thank you very much i appreciate it daniel bodner chairman president and chief executive officer sure jeff operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this does conclude our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to alan roden for any closing remarks alan roden senior vice

said subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter pioneer completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary pioneer critical power inc to cleanspark inc for approximately 4 4 million in cleanspark shares and warrants advancing our efforts to monetize undervalued assets based on the current share price at march 26 2019 this transaction is now worth approximately 8 2 million to pioneer and its shareholders operationally for the full course of 2018 we continued to produce positive adjusted ebitda and generated more than 2 million in cash from operations the weaker fourth quarter primarily reflects the impact of several large projects that were pushed into the first half of 2019 we finished the year with a backlog of 47 5 million and the timing of these large projects further supports our optimism for 2019 additionally in the last 120 days we have made significant progress in our efforts to create greater shareholder value through strategic alternatives moving well beyond identifying buyers and evaluating interest in certain pioneer assets added mr mazurek indeed i expect to have material announcements in this regard during the second quarter of 2019 and by the end of 2019 we expect to complete the sale of several business units and currently plan to dividend the proceeds to shareholders subject to legal and market conditions on may 2 2018 pioneer signed a definitive agreement to sell its pcep switchgear business as a result this business unit had been reclassified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2017 this agreement pertaining to the sale of pcep ultimately expired and was mutually terminated by the parties in january 2019 consequently at december 31 2018 due to the change of circumstance the company has presented the results of pcep within continuing operations and included results of the switchgear reporting unit in the t d solutions segment for all periods presented the consequence of not selling the entirety of the pcep business as we initially intended resulted in the reclassification of this business as continuing operations for all periods and contributed to our net loss added mr mazurek we continue to explore strategic alternatives related to the pcep business with the goal of monetizing this asset as soon as possible summary financial results revenue total revenue for the three month period ended

lows wall street opens up as us china talks progress march 28 welcome to the home for real time coverage of european equity markets brought to you by reuters stocks reporters and anchored today by helen reid reach her on messenger to share your thoughts on market moves helen reid thomsonreuters com reuters net have bund yields reached a bottom 1435 gmt rates have taken the spotlight this past week with speculation rife over recession risk and how long german bund yields can stay negative or whether this is just the beginning it s all rates driven at the moment says one trader some strategists reckon we may be at a bottom for bund yields though the bund is trading at levels consistent with even lower interest rates than expected strategist themos fiotakis and team note even if theoretically there s nothing to prevent the bund from plunging below the all time lows of 20 basis points that would not chime with the economic realities they argue euro area growth expectations are very low versus history and versus the rest of the world at a time when hard data is bouncing stronger they write adding the base case is for higher german yields we are painfully holding on to curve steepeners hold on tight helen reid ignore the short term brexit noise 1319 gmt in the run up to the now postponed end march deadline for britain to leave the eu a number of brokers have been making calls to buy into cheaply valued uk stocks and with no clear solution to the deadlock yet in sight the debate goes on michael salerno senior investment director at u s based cambridge associates believes investors should not fall into the trap of tactically increasing their uk exposure as protracted brexit uncertainty is likely regardless of near term developments the ultimate brexit end state may not be known for several years to come given both 1 the herculean task of unwinding years of economic and political convergence and developing a new relationship with the eu and 2 the current lack of consensus within the uk government regarding what the future relationship should entail he says investors should therefore maintain a long term perspective and ignore the short term brexit noise he then turns to the specific merits of increasing uk exposure or not uk equities in aggregate are fairly insulated from brexit dynamics but the market s valuations and fundamentals are a mixed bag and do not support a tactical tilt vis à vis other non us markets he argues adding that uk equities are not cheap enough to justify an overweight relative to other non u s markets with uk stocks lower beta attributes they could lag global peers in a scenario where external growth and bond yields surprised on the upside similarly any uk outperformance in anticipation of a softer brexit scenario could be fleeting as the likely gbp rally associated with such an outcome would weigh on the market s largely foreign sourced revenues he concludes danilo masoni story continues staying healthy with 1 trillion in free cash flow 1147 gmt healthcare stocks are the biggest driver that s helping the stoxx 600 stay afloat and their sectoral index is leading gainers in europe up 0 7 percent and very close to climbing back to june 2017 highs a timely research note from societe generale analysts led by florent cespedes looks at the merits of investing in the sector on which they re taking a rather upbeat view even though pharma stocks have slightly underperformed global stocks year to date their case is based on three key views 1 forecast 8 percent 2019 24 earnings cagr driven by recently launched products with the next wave of patent expiries not happening until 2023 2 valuations remain attractive even with the sector trading on a well deserved 5 percent relative premium on 12 month forward p e 8 percent above the 10 year average but still below the historical peak 3 us pricing pressure remains but innovative pharma companies with new differentiated portfolios should outperform on top of this they highlight possible high returns to shareholders given the solid fundamentals we expect the sector to generate 1 trillion in cumulative free cash flow between 2019 and 2024 chart below they say we expect over 50 of this to be allocated to dividends and buybacks with the balance used to fund organic r d and business development rather than transformational m a they add danilo masoni brexit the unpredictability is simply too high 1105 gmt the economists and analysts poring over brexit for nearly three years now seem to have taken humility from the process which is continuously confusing and obscure as readers have hopefully gathered by now the unpredictability is simply too high to advocate trying to position for a particular outcome to the negotiations ubs wealth management strategists write in their latest note on the outcome of last night s indicative votes if as currently seems likely mps do not approve the withdrawal agreement we believe they will eventually come to the conclusion that more time is needed they add saying the government will likely seek a long extension to article 50 with may unlikely to stay as prime minister and pressure for an eventual general election rising ubs offers with heavy caveats their views on how each of the major uk asset classes will perform in three scenarios the third meaningful vote passing a long extension and a no deal they see the ftse 250 recovering in every scenario besides a no deal while sterling could get to 1 37 in six months in the event of a deal and 1 33 in a long extension for the time being the most sensible approach seems to be to hedge sterling s downside risks they write helen reid golden charts 1001 gmt the charts are almost there the pan european stoxx 600 is a whisker away from forming a golden cross a bullish technical signal when the 50 day moving average dma rises above the longer term 200 dma for chartists it s considered a strong sign that a market is about to lurch higher here s our blog about it last week josephine mason what could cause equities to melt up 0946 gmt even considering such a question may look like wishful thinking at the moment but the debate is on and ajay rajadhyaksha head of macro research at barclays believes four triggers are needed for a melt up to happen here you go 1 china substantially increases fiscal and monetary stimulus the central question in our mind is whether the chinese authorities will embark on a similar to 2016 s rescue operation this time around 2 a credible us china trade deal is announced full resolution of all issues is unlikely a partial deal where china agrees to increase us imports appears more likely 3 political headwinds in europe abate on brexit the range of potential outcomes remains wide though we still believe a no deal brexit is unlikely on the continent italy struck a deal on the budget with the eu in december followed by some tightening in btp spreads but the risk of messy new elections in 2019 is increasing 4 euro area fiscal stimulus a new positive factor is easing fiscal policy which could add to the healthy labour market to spur private consumption with still solid investment growth on the other hand and with equities trading at fair value rajadhyaksha believes there s also a big risk to the downside namely that the soft patch in the united states morphs into a serious economic downturn given the late stage of expansion for now however he does not think a u s recession is imminent and his base main scenario looks rather neutral our base case is that equity earnings are entering a soggier soft patch than in 2016 and a v shaped recovery is unlikely we see modest upside for equities at best in 2019 he says danilo masoni brexit barometer under pressure 0856 gmt despite last night s indicative votes proving more or less inconclusive although a confirmatory vote drew the most support and a no deal brexit was resoundingly rejected the market seems cautiously optimistic that a solution to the brexit impasse will be found soon ireland s blue chip iseq index is up 0 9 percent which would be its biggest gain in two weeks while uk mid caps are up 0 4 percent and the ftse 100 is up 0 7 percent helped by a slightly weaker pound the housebuilders and retailers which usually benefit from encouraging brexit news are however notable by their absence and sterling s lukewarm response as pm may s offer to quit failed to convince key eurosceptics to change their minds indicates uncertainty is still prevailing there is unlikely to be much clarity in the short term and as a result sentiment towards uk domestic equities and the uk currency is likely to remain subdued and rangebound says edward park deputy chief investment officer at brooks macdonald investors on the continent are equally confused sterling is something to buy on the dips in the medium to long term i believe brexit will finish either with may s deal being approved or it doesn t happen at all and britain remains in the eu after the elections today however i m short on sterling take what i say as a view with little conviction politics are totally unpredictable says jci

thirds also would be satisfied with sanders that s about 10 percentage points higher than sander s performance among general democrats who were satisfied with him a little more than half of the time advertisement insider has been conducting a recurring poll through surveymonkey audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate s constituencies overlap we ask people whether they

place out of a field of then 20 warren is among the most experienced candidates in the field coming in third place behind sanders and biden when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on

perceived the candidates to be warren was considered emerged in the top five could elizabeth warren beat president trump referring back to insider s recurring poll warren overall was once believed to

but as long as the earnings engine sustains you will make healthy money said founder in an interview with etnow edited excerpts i am not sure about residential real estate but i agree that commercial real estate in india is a very viable asset class clearly there is still big shortage of high quality office space in the big cities there is a good reason to believe that well run commercial real estate play can generate yields of say 8 9 10 commercial real estate is an asset class whose time has not yet come in india and it is worth looking out for that i am not so sure on residential real estate i have been saying this for four five years and i still think that there still is not any affordability in residential real estate you have got a handful of developers who do a good job of residential real estate it does not mean that the asset class itself is still viable there is further scope for rallying in frontline private sector banks because the nbfc sector will give up more share to the private sector banks in next 12 months we have seen some of it in the last six seven months as the cost of wholesale money has risen and thus cost of money for the nbfcs and hfcs have gone to the point where them losing market share to private sector banks is inevitable that cycle has not yet fully played out on the other side of elections we will get another bout of problems in the short term money market in the wholesale money market and that will probably be the next trigger for another bout of market share shift from nbfcs to the private sector banks at one level i do not think it is any bad thing in india we are fairly accustomed to seeing auto demand cycles where demand is strong with mid teens high teens growth for three four years and then a slowdown which lasts for two three years we are probably half way through that slowdown both in cars and trucks at one level there is nothing surprising here it is healthy to have an auto cycle where you grow strongly for three four years and then slowdown for a couple of years where the demand situation is still pretty healthy is small ticket consumption so whether it is fmcg apparel restaurants qsr the small ticket consumption picture is fairly healthy and the recent budget that we went through should be a major stimulus to consumption over the next 12 months the tax cuts pm kisan maha pension yojana all the loan waivers that we heard about over the last 12 months should provide consumption stimulus due to the fact that the gst s ambit has been pulled back so aggressively there is enough to sustain small ticket consumption in our country obviously sooner or later we need a jobs revival you cannot indefinitely consume even small ticket stuff without a job creation cycle but at least for the next 12 months there is reasonable visibility that small ticket consumption will hold up even as auto continues to start in sputter i am not an expert on the subject and as you alluded to in your question the number of imponderables in that picture are multiple exactly how deep is the china slowdown if it a slowdown or a revival by itself is a mystery for most of us sitting outside china but what does look relatively clear is that across the western world be it in america or europe an economic slowdown is coming through both the us fed in december and the european central bank and the bank of england recently are all signalling a slowdown in economic growth a slowdown in economic growth in the world s big economic blocks cannot be good news for metal prices while the china piece is a black box and a bit of a mystery to me the data that is coming from north america and from europe does suggest a slowdown which should lead to tampering in metal prices indian metals and mining stocks show a 70 correlation with the prices on lme the implications are self evident the global risk on rally started around 22nddecember when fed chairman powell signalled that he was abandoning his tightening monetary policy stance between 22nd december and end of february equity markets across the world rallied by around 10 we did not participate in that we started catching up with that rally over the last three four weeks or so and in that regard we have fallen behind global equity markets by a distance for the last year year and a half there is very little reason to say that the indian index as a whole has got lots of upside in it our earnings growth has been sclerotic 7 5 is the 10 year cagr on nifty earnings last six seven years we have seen hardly more than 6 7 earnings growth to have that sort of situation as a backdrop and have an index trading at pe multiples we saw in early 2008 does send alarm bells ringing in my head with regards to the index as a whole where there are opportunities it is relatively clear in our country that the consumption engine is the only engine that can fire a because there is a middle class which is rising in the world and wants to spend more and b because there is a government in place which wants to pump consumption up so the consumption engine is going to help us deal with this elongated bout of no capex growth and in that context specific bouts of stocks whether it is retail banks or consumption plays works it is also relatively clear that the currency is overvalued 68 69 to the rupee does not make sense export growth has once again slowed down and if you assume that the fair value of the currency is around 75 that would suggest that there is a fair tailwind coming for exporters it and pharma should do well as the export oriented sectors get a currency fillip in the next 12 months so there are pockets in the indian economy where you can make money consumption private sector banks exporters but there is very little reason for me to say that the index as a whole is undervalued and should be running up any moment now on the back of either global macro or election news let us take it sector by sector in fmcg the structural compounders the consistent compounders with long strong track records are well known we have discussed companies like asian paints marico before one often hears commentaries around these names or around hdfc bank that the price to book multiple is very rich and there should be a correction the challenge that one has with these stocks is the underlying compounding in the business consistently asian paints cash flow per share has compounded at 21 22 over one year three year five year 10 years 20 years the underlying compounding in this business is so strong that the pe multiple almost gets irrelevant over time periods of over three years anybody who tries to say i will sell asian paints or an hdfc bank because it looks expensive on conventional price matrix runs into the challenge of compounding in the business in consumption we have half a dozen companies which keep compounding at a healthy rate in banking hdfc bank is the obvious compounder but there is reason to believe that there are other companies who will join that list and the recent bout of change in indian banking change at the top of icici and axis bank is very encouraging maybe one needs to do a lot of work to see if there are other compounders we can dig out there which can have as bright a future as hdfc bank pharma is a beaten down sector that has been thrashed badly in the last three years but the fundamentals in terms of rocs are very strong cash generation is strong and the last three four months of channel check that we are doing suggest that an export driven pharma recovery should be round the corner and this is a sector where at the top of my head i can think of four of five names where the rocs are north of 25 there are strong moats around those businesses and so pharma is another sector where we are looking forward to discovery you named abbott but i think there is probably one or two more there which could make it into that compounders list it is not as if you have to go and buy the nifty tomorrow morning to make money at least a dozen companies have consistently compounded your wealth year in and year out for the last 5 15 years and it is a shame to ignore them to pick some company with a low pe multiple which you potentially believe will rally tomorrow morning or buy the nifty there is very little reason to buy the index as a whole because the index as a whole is not that promising it contains a lot of weak companies which have struggled to grow in the past you are much better off focussing on companies like asian paints or hdfc bank one way is to think about pe multiples and it is quite important to develop a mental framework which allows you to rationalise pe multiples typically if you look at most stocks in our country most of these names that we are discussing over a 10 year period either the pe multiples have halved or doubled if the pe multiple doubles over 10 years it gives you a 7 compounding just on the pe multiples if it halves it is minus 7 if you have an underlying eps growth engine which chugs along 25 even if the pe multiples halves in the next 10 years you get 25 minus 7 around 18 most of these companies have dividend yields of around 2 3 so assuming that 25 earnings growth sustains which is the underlying premise of looking at companies like asian paints or the abbott s pe multiple comes off by 50 with 7 18 dividend yield you are making 20 total shareholder returns with the high degree of visibility with lower volatility consistently across time that is as good an outcome as you can get in large and midcap investing in one of the world s largest stock markets that is why i called my book coffee can investing the low risk route to stupendous wealth this is your best bet in india consistently chugging out good returns year after year over very long periods of time i completely agree with you though that there is a risk that the pe multiples could come off but as long as the earnings engine sustains you will make healthy money

march 31 polls seen as test for turkish leader and ak party amid economic downturn triggered by 2018 currency crisis istanbul turkey millions of turkish voters are preparing to elect mayors and local officials on march 31 in a race seen as a new test for president recep tayyip erdogan s ruling party in the wake of last year s currency crisis campaigning in istanbul visibly picked up mere weeks before the polls with political discussions intensifying in the country s largest city political parties are making their last efforts to appeal to voters raising national and local matters during the election and canvassing on the squares and streets of the economic capital of turkey in addition to city and district mayors turkey s more than 57 million registered voters are expected to pick members of district councils and neighbourhood heads in the elections the seventh one in five years erdogan s justice and development ak party has joined hands with its ally in the previous two polls the far right nationalist movement party mhp in a bloc known as the people s alliance 190327174109964 the main challenger to erdogan s bloc is the nation s alliance comprising the centre left main opposition republican people s party chp and the right wing good iyi party both alliances have come up with dozens of joint mayoral candidates in the 81 provinces of turkey istanbul and the capital ankara are seen as the most intense arenas to battle over for the two alliances al jazeera examines the main issues dominating the political agenda before the critical polls economic downturn the turkish economy which slipped into its first recessionin a decade has topped the election agenda so far the economy has been hit hard since the turkish lira plummeted against the us dollar last year losing as much as 40 percent of its value amid macroeconomic and structural worries investor concerns over the independence of the central bank and a diplomatic spat with the united states although the government s move to increase interest rates helped the currency regain some of its value it also caused a massive decline in bank loans and a loss of business confidence the depreciating currency has put pressure on businesses hit by foreign currency nominated debt while high inflation has decreased citizens purchasing power curbing consumer spending turkish gross domestic product gdp per capita fell to 9 632 in 2018 from 10 597 in 2017 at nominal prices due to the lira crash the turkish government confronted with high inflation before the local polls has set up stalls through municipalities to sell fruits and vegetables at prices lower than the market rate as the government blamed speculators and middlemen for the skyrocketing prices the government sees the economic problems common people are facing and is trying to help through these grocery stalls i do not see any harm with these tents they are set up to help citizens nedime sahin a 36 year old housewife told al jazeera but faruk kuzu a 22 year old university student disagreed this will not fix anything the government is giving people cheap food to be able to get votes in the local elections while the general economy is suffering fatigue government officials admit the problems facing the economy need to be addressed but claim voters still believe the government and its mayors will solve them we know that some of our voters are not happy with the recent economic developments we cannot ignore that yasin aktay an erdogan adviser told al jazeera 190327052244411 he added however people do not believe any opposition party will address the problems they believe the ak party is the party to address these problems as they look at the overall performance of 17 years the indicators show that the country developed immensely under ak party rule erdogan who has ruled the country as prime minister and then president since 2003 has led the emerging market country s economic transition and growth the opposition on the other hand says the government is to blame for the current economic situation and for trying to cover it up gamze akkus ilgezdi deputy chairwoman of the chp believes it is not possible for a government that led the country for 17 years and created the current economic crisis to solve it turkey has never felt poverty this much people only buy essential needs from groceries people want action from the people who hold the power not promises and they surely do not believe the solution lies with this government she told al jazeera in 2017 erdogan himself said the ak party was suffering from what he called metal fatigue and forced some mayors and officials to resign after a key referendum allowed him to claim the chair of the party as the turkish president some citizens believe a lack of alternatives to the ak party is a large contributor to its success it is not that the leading party is doing great but there have been various internal struggles within the chp which make people vote for the ak party instead also it is the only running party with governing experience in the last two decades beyazit kocaoglu a 24 year old university student told al jazeera debate on the state s survival the political discussions over the state s beka which means survival and abidance in old turkish language refer to internal and external threats against the turkish state and has generally been brought up by government officials to criticise opposition parties ak party officials claim that parties in the nation s alliance are cooperating with the pro kurdish people s democracy party hdp which they say is the political wing of the outlawed kurdistan workers party pkk a group that has fought turkey for independence and then autonomy for over 30 years the nation s alliance leaders have denied these claims the hdp which has denied having links with the pkk has decided not to put forward any candidates in turkey s six largest provinces istanbul ankara izmir bursa antalya and adana instead it has thrown its support behind candidates running against erdogan s people s alliance the nation s alliance calls the beka debate a government effort to divert attention away from the suffering economy this is part of the government rhetoric aimed at polarising our society turkey does not have any beka problem turkey s problems are about economy production and welfare chp s ilgezdi told al jazeera the ak party also says the main opposition chp is cooperating with the outlawed organisation of preacher and businessman fethullah gulen blamed for a failed coup attempt in july 2016 that killed hundreds of people chp officials have repeatedly called the claims baseless government officials say members of the gulen movement a former ally of the ak party have been running a parallel state within the civilian and military bureaucracy and pursuing their own agenda gulen who lives in exile in the us rejects the claims tens of thousands of people have been arrested and civil servants suspended or sacked over suspected links to gulen since 2016 a state of emergency imposed following the failed coup was lifted last july officials say in addition to internal threats such as the pkk and the gulen movement the government faces multiple threats from the outside including countries who have supported the opposition in past elections and are trying to undermine the ak party past several elections have been used as instruments by foreign powers as well as internal groups to intervene into turkish national politics the coup attempt pkk terror and rise of far right in the west have contributed to this aktay told al jazeera we saw some european countries openly giving support to the hdp while banning ak party activities within their borders we also know that some gulf arab countries work to see the ak party fail the adviser added without elaborating trustee municipalities after a ceasefire and talks between the pkk and the state broke down in july 2015 the predominantly kurdish southeastern region descended into violence and several cities across the country witnessed bomb attacks the violence has subsequently abated after major security operations in the region were carried out the government has detained hundreds of hdp officials on terrorism charges since then and placed scores of trustees in the vast majority of town and city municipalities held by the hdp under emergency rule during election campaigns government officials including erdogan said they might do the same if candidates linked to terrorism claim office in the upcoming polls but hdp officials said this was not easy as the state of emergency was not in force any more ak party s yasin aktay who is from the region believes people in southeastern turkey are

nations cannot be dependent on monetary policy alone to boost economic growth the global financier tells david chance finance veteran agustin carstens who heads the bank for international settlements has first hand experience of a debt crisis from his time as mexico s finance minister photo bloomberg central banks saved the world during the financial crisis but an over reliance on easy money may well be the reason economic growth has been so tepid since then one of the world s top financiers has told the irish independent agustin carstens who heads the bank for international settlements the central bankers central bank doesn t believe the world is about to head off another cliff into a recession but says that the current policy mix means that weaknesses show up more frequently in the global economy we are settling for an environment of a sort of subdued potential growth and that s a state where i don t think we should be mr carstens said in an interview following his delivery of the annual whitaker lecture at the central bank of ireland the issue is that we cannot be solely dependent on monetary policy to assure a much higher potential rate of economic growth he said sitting at the centre of the world financial system he is in a good position to judge as it is the bank for international settlements that facilitates joint action by central banks despite an unprecedented amount of policy support from central banks the federal reserve european central bank and bank of japan alone injected 15trn into their economies the recovery from the 2008 09 crisis in the developed world has been among the weakest on record with global growth faltering the us federal reserve last week called time on its policy of raising interest rates while the european central bank has indicated it will hold rates at zero for longer and has reintroduced a measure to inject cash into the banking system there has been talk of more radical measures from central banks to combat what some economists are calling secular stagnation a long period of negligible or no economic growth these range from pushing interest rates even deeper into negative territory expanding government spending to boost demand and using central bank balance sheets to finance government deficits he is wary of calls being made across the globe for governments to borrow and spend more at a time when interest rates are so low saying it should be used on a selective basis the possibility of much higher interest rates of higher premia can arise quite quickly if there is a lot of fiscal profligacy so countries have to be very very careful in using that instrument he said that is a lesson ireland learned the hard way during the global financial crisis and the years it has taken since then to return the budget to balance even though debt levels remain high mr carstens himself has had first hand experience of the dangers of a debt crisis two years after he joined the central bank mexico defaulted on its debt in an episode that shook the world financial system and triggered the decade long latin american debt crisis he was finance minister when the 2008 crisis hit and famously took out a hedge on the country s entire oil production that protected the economy against a crash in prices in 2009 mexico reaped a 5bn windfall from the hedge if you thought the financial crisis had put an end to borrowing you would be wrong stimulated by low interest rates global debt has surged by 27trn since 2016 to hit 244trn 216trn by the third quarter of last year that is more than three times the economic output of the entire world total government debt hit 65trn in 2018 up from 37trn a decade ago if priming the pumps with more central bank money or government spending is not the answer then it only seems fair to ask mr carstens what is the first issue he cites is the rise in trade disputes and protectionism data from the world trade organisation 2018 report shows that restrictive measures covering 588 3bn have been implemented in the 12 months to october 2018 more than seven times the level recorded a year earlier president donald trump s pledge to make america great again has seen the united states implement a range of measures to restrict imports so as to bolster domestic industry and to shrink the country s trade deficit trade disputes are something that are man made and a more concerted effort to bring that into a steady state would be much better mr carstens said populist measures like president trump s pushback on trade may work in the political arena but appear not to have had the desired effect the us trade deficit hit a record in 2018 a lot of hard work has been put in to ensuring that banks pose less of a risk to the financial system and to ensure that taxpayers do not end up on the hook for their failure as they did here regulators have also worked to put in place measures that limit the extent to which financing amplifies economic cycles such as capital requirements for banks and loan to value and loan to income rules that have been implemented by the central bank of ireland mr carstens says that so far the measures some of which are overseen by his organisation appear to be giving a positive result although he cautions that there are few easy choices making labour and product markets more flexible and implementing post crisis financial regulatory reforms are also key to securing long term growth according to the bis the path between growth and financial sustainability is not such a wide path and we need to get the right balances that is sometimes an elusive quest he said

operating decisions and performance evaluation ifrs does not allow for the inclusion of joint ventures on a proportionate basis these results include additional non ifrs measure such as ebitda and cash flow from operations before non recurring items the adjusted results are not generally accepted measure of financial performance under ifrs the company s method of calculating these financial performance measures may differ from other companies and accordingly they may not be comparable to measure used by other companies refer to the md a for a reconciliation of these non ifrs adjusted results financial performance gvic s results for the year reflected the continued progress being made in the key business information growth initiatives as well as the evolution of the community media business it is important to note that digital and data products and services command higher business valuations than print products so the company can grow overall profit and value with lower consolidated revenues the overall level of revenue growth in the relevant operations for the year is all the more significant in this light gvic s adjusted 1 consolidated revenue was 222 6 million for the year down 1 4 adjusted consolidated ebitda was 22 9 million for the year down 22 9 from the prior year the overall financial results for the year were impacted by an accounting change in one of its operations two transactions and significant operating investment revenue and ebitda at specialty technical publishers stp were both reduced by 0 9 million due to a change in accounting reflecting the transition in operations to a solely digital subscription based business the change coincides with operational changes being made at stp including the phasing out of the paper versions of the product and results in revenue being deferred over the term of the subscription contracts the change will also impact the monthly revenues recognized going forward into the first six months of 2019 in addition the adjusted consolidated results were impacted by two transactions that affected the comparability of the results 1 the sale of the comprehensive oilfield service and supply database cossd which was last published by the company in june 2017 and 2 the purchase of the remaining interest in infomine resulting in infomine s results being consolidated into the company s results as of april 2018 together these two transactions resulted in a net revenue increase of 2 0 million and a net ebitda decrease of 0 9 million as compared to the prior year excluding these one time items gvic s adjusted consolidated revenue was 221 5 million for the year down 1 8 and adjusted consolidated ebitda was 24 7 million for the year down 5 1 million or 16 9 from the prior year the decline in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to increased operating investments made in some of the key strategic initiatives including the rew real estate portal agriculture show expansion new weather and agricultural markets subscription based products mining data and intelligence information products and new digital community media products in total the company s adjusted ebitda was reduced 5 1 million as a result of the 0 9 million stp accounting change and 4 2 million of operating expense investment in the specific areas indicated this does not include other additional ongoing operating expenses that are being incurred to deliver on the company s growth strategies additional capital expenditure investment was also made in the same areas these investments are being made to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the company s markets that require timely action to be taken the growth in revenues being achieved and the demand for the company s products this reflects underscores the fact that the investments are working and value is being created the transformation of the business is progressing approximately two thirds of the company s business information revenue now comes from data digital products and events and only one third comes from print advertising revenue of the data digital products and event revenue approximately 85 comes from data and digital product revenue and 15 comes from events this mix compares to approximately one third data digital products and events revenue and two thirds print advertising revenue five years ago within the business information operations highlights and operational overview business information environmental property and financial segment the environmental property and financial segment grew 4 0 in adjusted revenue adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 30 2 as a result of 1 the change in accounting for stp and 2 the operating investments made in key growth areas particularly rew ca and eris excluding the adjustment at stp adjusted revenue was up 7 0 and adjusted ebitda was down 18 9 for the environmental property and financial segment eris experienced strong growth in both canada and the u s with significant new customer additions and renewals including new mid sized customers in the u s market revenue grew 14 7 as a result and profitability grew as well despite the continued investment being made in people and product development rew ca the company s online real estate portal continued to grow in terms of site features traffic and revenues rew ca is now the 1 real estate site in the lower mainland and victoria in terms of traffic according to comscore traffic in toronto grew rapidly in the year revenue continued to grow despite the slower real estate conditions in the vancouver and toronto markets weaker market conditions often increase the need for developers and realtors to advertise and invest in lead generation in order to sell homes commodities segment the commodities segment s total adjusted revenue grew 2 0 for the year adjusted ebitda for the year fell by 4 7 due to the continued softness of the energy and mining markets and the ongoing operational investments excluding the purchase of infomine and the sale of the cossd commodity information adjusted revenue decreased by 1 5 and adjusted ebitda increased 3 9 conditions in the agricultural markets appear to have stabilized but uncertainty from trade disputes and the consolidation of major crop input companies persists the company continued to invest in its agricultural information operations in key growth areas such as outdoor shows and online listings which resulted in improved operation performance in particular for both agdealer and ag in motion the energy group continued to reap the benefits of the substantial restructurings enacted over the last two years the energy information group is now focused on 1 data analytics and intelligence products and 2 digital media these products continued to experience stable revenue versus the prior year despite continuing soft market conditions stabilized revenues and the restructurings resulted in a substantial increase in ebitda for 2018 compared to the prior year the company s mining operations the northern miner and infomine operated in choppy market conditions the northern miner grew revenues and profit and hosted two very successful conferences the canadian mining symposium may 2018 in london england and the progressive mine forum september 2018 in toronto having purchased the remaining interest in infomine the company operationally merged its mining operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 this will result in cost efficiencies and new revenue opportunities in 2019 community media community media print advertising revenues continued to decline as anticipated while digital revenues grew substantially the 4 0 overall adjusted revenue decline for the community media business was lower than previous years total community media adjusted revenue declined 13 5 in 2016 and 6 6 in 2017 as a result of strong digital performance digital revenue grew 46 3 for the year it is becoming apparent that a viable long term digital community media business model exists where the company can leverage its broad presence in local markets across western canada and offer local websites digital marketing services and specialty digital products the company is investing in the digital business by hiring and training to broaden our skills and experience base in line with market needs and opportunities as well as product and services development the investment is working as traffic is growing revenue is growing and profitability is growing customer retention levels are high which indicates the digital products and services being offered are working for our clients digital traffic is being monetized effectively and the actual dollar size of the digital solutions being sold is growing and attractive compared to print advertising which was not historically the case outlook the company is at an attractive juncture where it has meaningful growth opportunities in each of its sectors with which to increase value and is achieving market traction in each one the agriculture energy mining commercial and residential real estate and financial markets are large addressable markets that offer significant opportunities for both data analytics intelligence offerings as well as content marketing solutions the evolution of the media business one meaningful change for the company s prospects is that the digital community media business is evolving in a manner that now offers significant growth and value creation opportunity the company s digital community media operations are growing steadily in audience size revenue and profitability the company s balance of effort and strategic focus is working the progress being made is translating into new product delivery customer satisfaction and revenue generation the agriculture market is stable and gvic farmmedia continues to have a variety of growth opportunities to pursue including digital media digital marketing services online equipment listings shows weather and other premium subscription products while the mining market has slowed somewhat and energy remains soft revenue opportunities exist to grow revenues in a variety of areas including data and information subscription products as well as shows and events the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to offer opportunity for eris and rew ca while some of the company s markets are experiencing slowdowns in residential real estate activity as stated softer real estate markets often represent a greater need for realtor and developer advertising and lead generation depending on the level of slowdown while print advertising declines are expected to continue in community media digital revenue and profits are growing significantly and are providing a greater level of offset to the print revenue declines it is also apparent that good print products still offer good value to readers and advertisers and provide cash flow to fund the company s growth initiatives importantly it now appears that a viable digital community media business model exists where we may be able to preserve the value of the existing print community media business with lower revenue but a more valuable digital business as outlined the company plans to continue to invest in its key strategic areas the investments are critical to the company s growth plan and are resulting in demonstrable value creation given the uncertain north american and global economic conditions that exist and the stage of transformation some of the company s businesses are in the company will operate cautiously but believes continued investment is necessary for long term value creation cost efficiency opportunities continue to be pursued where possible to help manage profitability while investment is being made management intends to build on the progress of the last few years in strengthening the company s financial position by further reducing debt a strengthened balance sheet will

all adjusted measures which are not alternatives to ifrs financial measures management focuses on cash flow from operations before non recurring items per share as the primary measure of operating

china has pledged to further open its massive financial markets to foreign investors since last year amid a trade war with the united states bao china will sharply expand market access for foreign banks and securities and insurance companies especially in its financial services sector premier li keqiang said on thursday as senior u s officials arrived in beijing for more trade talks the government will also work on more favorable policies for foreign investors to trade chinese bonds li said in a speech at the annual boao forum held on china s southern island of hainan we are quickening the full opening of market access for foreign investors in banking securities and insurance sectors he said li s remarks add to speculation that china may soon announce new rules that will allow foreign banks and insurance firms to increase their presence in china china has pledged to further open its massive financial markets to foreign investors since last year amid a trade war with the united states foreign businesses have long complained that liberalisation has been too narrow and implementation spotty sources told reuters on wednesday that the united states and china have made progress in all areas under discussion in trade talks with unprecedented movement on the touchy issue of forced technology transfers as china had put proposals on the table that went further than in the past but sticking points remain li said the business scope of foreign banks as well as market access for credit rating companies bank card settlements and non bank card payments will all be expanded sharply with restrictions on the scope of foreign securities companies and insurance brokers expected to be removed such measures will be implemented this year in a relatively forceful way he said li said china will also announce policies to help foreign investors to invest in and trade china s bonds just before chinese bonds inclusion in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index one of the most widely tracked in the world scheduled to start on monday but global investors access to hedging instruments continues to be restricted and clarification on tax collection policy is needed asifma a financial industry lobby noted in a report last week li said china will also issue more favorable rules for foreign acquisitions of chinese listed firms beijing is drafting rules related to a new foreign investment law that was passed earlier this month the rules are expected to be completed this year beijing will revise and shorten a negative list of areas where foreign investment is restricted and will publish it before the end of june li said no trust deficit with u s in a meeting with foreign and chinese business executives on thursday afternoon the premier said he doesn t think there is a deficit of trust between china and the united states we need to prevent a trust deficit from occurring otherwise the damage it could do to u s china relations is incalculable said li adding that trade frictions remain a sticky point china must protect intellectual property otherwise there is no hope for the nation s transformation li said u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrived in beijing on thursday and are scheduled to have a working dinner with vice premier liu he talks are expected to last for a full day on friday hard battle li also sought on thursday to ease investors concerns over china s cooling economy saying beijing has enough policy tools to fight a hard battle li said china will cut real interest rate levels and lower financing costs for chinese companies but did not elaborate on which interest rate he was referring to li had made similar comments in a speech earlier this month positive changes in china s economy in march exceeded the government s expectations he said some analysts say shockingly weak industrial profit data on wednesday have added urgency for more policy easing china s industrial firms posted their worst slump in profits since late 2011 in the first two months of this year amid slowing demand at home and abroad analysts at capital economics said they believe the benchmark lending rate will be cut in the weeks ahead though sources have told reuters such a move may be a last resort if the economy does not show signs of responding to previous support measures other china watchers say policymakers may be waiting for march and first quarter data in mid april for a better picture of whether conditions are starting to stabilize and how much additional policy easing may be needed li said he could not rule out the possibility that there would be some fluctuations in the world s second largest economy this year but added that earlier policy steps were gaining traction however chinese policymakers including li have stressed that beijing would not resort to flood like stimulus that would unleash huge amounts of cheap credit out of concern that could add to a mountain of debt the central bank has not cut benchmark rates since the last downturn in 2015 but it has been guiding financing costs lower since last year through various means including liquidity injections china s economic growth cooled to 6 6 percent last year the slowest pace in nearly 30 years and analysts polled by reuters expect a further pullback to 6 3 percent in 2019 complete your tv viewing experience

washington president trump is getting exactly what he wants on the economy but it may not last the federal reserve has abruptly stopped its march toward higher interest rates as mr trump demanded the tax cuts he signed in late 2017 are in full swing his attempt to rewrite the global rules of trade are underway and he proclaims himself happy with the array of new tariffs he has imposed his recent comments suggest he is unconcerned about slowdowns in china and europe which he considers economic rivals but while mr trump points with pride to last year s economic growth and promises even faster growth to come there are signs that his most dependable talking point is eroding on thursday the commerce department issued a downward revision of its estimates for economic growth in the fourth quarter pushing one measure of the full year s growth down as well forecasters outside the white house including officials at the fed expect growth to slow even more this year economic data suggests that slowdown is already underway in the first quarter manufacturing is losing some of its steam from last year s rapid growth and job creation is also moderating chief executives of some of the nation s biggest companies see investment hiring and sales growth all slowing this year three quarters of business economists say they are more worried about growth undershooting their forecasts than overshooting it and half have revised those forecasts downward for this year white house officials see growth staying above 3 percent for the next few years and potentially for an entire decade provided mr trump can continue carrying out his economic agenda including another round of tax cuts a 1 trillion infrastructure plan and additional deregulation
a long time ago the tax was proposed by the gop and opposed by democrats it became law but it didn t last long illinois republicans have made it absolutely undeniably incontrovertibly indisputably unquestionably pick your adverb clear that they re opposed to gov j b pritzker s call for a graduated income tax to deal with the state s dire fiscal health consider all 44 gop representatives are signed up as sponsors or co sponsors to a resolution by house minority leader jim durkin r western springs hr 153 which argues a graduate tax would create added burdens and dissuade economic prosperity the so called progressive income tax punishes hard working middle class families and small businesses that make up the majority of the tax base and would mean turning our backs on illinois residents more tax hikes will not solve illinois fiscal problems pritzker s proposed 3 4 billion tax increase will lead to even more out migration of illinois families businesses and jobs tax and spend illinois democrats cannot be trusted with more of our tax dollars that is why illinois republicans stand united against the pritzker madigan tax hike republican state chairman tim schneider the truth is every state that has put in a graduated income tax the middle class always pays more that s what pritzker doesn t want known that s the truth and we ve got to get the truth out a recurrent campaign theme from former republican gov bruce rauner last year which better government association fact checkers said was not even close to accurate we rate it false given such disdain would you be surprised to learn that once upon a time illinois enacted a graduated income tax proposed by a conservative republican governor and passed by a gop majority legislature largely with downstate and republican votes as almost all chicagoans and most democrats opposed the plan well it s all true here s how it happened back in the winter of 1931 32 when the lion s share of state revenues still came from a state not local tax on real estate and personal property like automobiles household goods inventory and other effects the chief protagonist was louis l emmerson a conservative mt vernon merchant and banker and popular three term secretary of state who was elected governor in the 1928 national gop landslide that put herbert hoover in the white house and in illinois gave the gop margins of 81 72 in the house and 33 18 in the senate at the time the general assembly was elected from 51 districts 19 in cook county and 32 elsewhere under the 1870 constitution emmerson was a courageous executive who tried to cure the financial hangovers of the almost bankrupt cook county governments wrote the late robert p howard a former chicago tribune springfield correspondent in his excellent collection of illinois gubernatorial biographies mostly good and competent men he didn t foresee the depression no one did which became his biggest burden as it was hoover s as the economic crash took hold and illinoisans suffered emmerson appointed special relief commissions and called the general assembly into four special sessions the first convening on november 5 1931 his proclamation noted local and state governments in illinois are face to face with the most serious financial crisis in their history an untimely cook county property tax reassessment in 1928 meant tax collections were two years behind schedule and cook had not paid its share of state or local taxes during that time almost 550 million or 10 2 billion in today s dollars moreover the total statewide property tax base was down some 1 7 billion 32 billion inflation adjusted 20 percent lower than in 1928 due primarily to delay in the collection of taxes and shrinkage in the amount of money realized from local assessments the governments of chicago and cook county are unable to meet current bills to fulfill their financial obligations or to obtain additional credit and failure of cook county to pay its share of taxes has seriously handicapped the state government emmerson said property owners paid no taxes for two years and most of them set aside no reserves to meet the bills when they were finally presented the governor noted in the meantime an industrial depression reduced the income of property owners to such an extent that many of them found themselves unable to pay he added emmerson urged lawmakers to be guided by the general principle that there must be no increase in the burden of taxation but there should be a better distribution of that burden and receipts from new methods of taxation be used to reduce property taxes the preferred solution emmerson s tax conference reported to lawmakers with his blessing was an income tax with graduated rates every consideration points to the conclusion that the time has come for the enactment of a state income tax the panel said the fairest distribution of governmental burden yet devised has been accomplished by the federal income tax copied by 16 states with satisfactory results and the production of revenues at the expense of those best able to bear the burden npr illinois sean crawford talks with charlie wheeler going to an income tax was necessary to increase the taxpayer base to produce the needed revenue and also to spread the costs of government over a larger proportion of citizens than represented by real estate taxpayers which the committee deemed socially equitable and politically desirable the new revenue would go to replace state property taxes for local schools to provide financial assistance to relief efforts in cook and other counties and to underwrite grants to local school districts a legislative package embodying the commission s recommendations was filed in the senate a week later including sb 20 the income tax measure despite efforts largely by chicago democrats to water down or sidetrack the proposal the proposal cleared the senate 29 17 on december 16 and moved to the house here too the bill s supporters fended off hostile amendments and motions ultimately making only one notable change increasing to 2 500 from 2 000 the exemption for heads of families before approving the plan 78 59 on february 2 the senate accepted the house changes the next day 28 15 and emmerson signed the bill on february 22 contrary to what today s political observers might expect the roll calls in both chambers showed republicans solidly behind the plan democrats generally against and cook county lawmakers of both parties resolutely opposed in the senate final vote republicans supplied 24 of the 28 yes votes while chicago democrats were 11 of the 15 no votes the other four being chicago and suburban republicans three downstate democrats supported the plan as did two chicago republicans in all the measure was rejected by 17 of the 19 cook county senators the roll call was similar in the house of the 78 yes votes none came from cook county s 57 representatives 30 democrats and 27 republicans including one democrat and three republican suburbanites among the no votes was house speaker david e shanahan a republican from chicago s bridgeport neighborhood and the longest serving speaker in state history until his record was eclipsed by another south side irishman michael j madigan four downstate democrats also rejected the governor s plan forty five republicans and 33 democrats from the collar counties and downstate provided the margin of victory setting the stage for emmerson s signature on february 22 giving illinois its first ever income tax a graduated one to boot the new law contained six brackets with increasing rates income up to 1 000 would be taxed at 1 percent while increments from 1 000 to 4 000 would see a 2 percent rate the rate would be 3 percent up to 9 000 4 percent up to 16 000 5 percent to 25 000 and 6 percent for increments above that a single person would get a 1 000 exemption which jumped to 2 500 for family heads credits of 300 were included for children younger than 18 and dependents and homeowners could cut their income tax bills by 100 paid for property taxes adjusted for inflation the exemptions would be generous by today s standards almost 18 000 for a single person more than 46 000 for the head of a family and 5 600 for youngsters illinois current personal exemption is 2 225 worth just 120 in 1932 dollars emmerson s victory was short lived however exactly eight months after he signed sb 20 the illinois supreme court without dissent ruled the income tax law violated the revenue article of the 1870 constitution which limited the legislature s revenue raising powers to taxing property based on its value licensing occupations including specifically peddlers hawkers showmen and jugglers among others and franchises and privileges income is property the justices said and all taxes must be levied on property by valuation so an attempt to levy a tax upon property income by means of a graduated scale that increases in rate as applied to increases from personal property and earnings violates the constitutional provision with illinois finances still reeling from the great depression a year later emmerson s successor democrat henry horner and newly elected democratic legislative majorities enacted a new tax on an occupation selling tangible personal property at retail and the court gave its blessing to what s commonly known as the illinois sales tax not until 37 years after emmerson s setback did illinois finally establish an income tax when in 1969 republican gov richard b ogilvie and democratic chicago mayor richard j daley negotiated a flat rate tax at 2 5 percent for individuals and 4 percent for corporations this time a unanimous supreme court quickly upheld the measure ruling the tax was not imposed on property but rather on the privilege of earning or receiving income moreover the justices noted the 1870 revenue article also authorizes the legislature to tax other subjects or objects the statement in the 1932 decision that the general assembly is limited to property taxes occupation taxes or privilege taxes is disavowed the court said the following year illinois voters adopted a new constitution specifically permitting an income tax but only at a non graduated rate essentially codifying the ogilvie daley deal now after half a century with the flat tax as the status quo pritzker is hoping to write the next chapter in the state s income tax saga finally realizing emmerson s vision of a progressive income tax charles n wheeler iii is director of the public affairs reporting

a few weeks ago i wrote a column on economic populism and attempted to describe why the dogma is surgically tearing rich countries especially the united states apart the piece was light on prescription so i m going to take this as an opportunity to clarify some assumptions and outline an actionable solution but first some context global capitalism is under siege because while it has produced astounding gains market integration seamless capital flows and ai advancements have left a certain demographic in the dark in the united states for example this group is generally low skilled and male inhabiting the area colloquially referred to as the heartland essentially those living between the coasts with a high school diploma the problem manifested in wage stagnation and a declining life expectancy will only worsen as technological advancement further chips away at the foundations of work we are undoubtedly in a moment of unprecedented economic change and in undergoing such reordering we need to relax some fundamental assumptions this isn t to say that the growth driven economic model is inadequate rather the measure is becoming irrelevant it s no stretch of the imagination to assume that growth will be exponential over the few decades technological progress will continue to make production cheaper and more efficient rising gdp will tell us there s nothing wrong but make no mistake things are changing and a whole lot of low skilled workers are being left behind among the most common occupations in america are retail salespeople back office clerks and call centre workers you needn t a complex understanding of silicon valley to hypothesize that these jobs are highly susceptible to automation let us then suppose that the ai revolution will persist wiping out millions of american jobs in due course one study conservatively estimates a net 7 loss this year alone the fourth industrial revolution represents an historical economic juncture so the policies we seek to implement must be reflective of these groundbreaking changes universal basic income ubi doesn t present an all encompassing solution to the economic challenges of the 21st century but it would surely buy us some valuable time in reordering the structural tenets of the growth oriented economy ubi is essentially the idea that every citizen rich or poor of a given society shall receive a periodic cheque from the government no strings attached one can debate the policy on philosophical or ideational grounds but for our purposes i ll adhere more to the economics of why it makes sense and why the arch capitalists in tech are embracing the proposal besides those who cry socialism in opposition to such a proposal either a don t know what socialism is or b don t wish to have a meaningful conversation the idea stems from the likes of john stuart mill thomas paine and milton friedman yes the legendary conservative economist let me emphasize that the idea was not engineered by the big government left but by those economists who understanding the risk of distorting incentives recognized financial subsistence as an imperative for rich societies to sustain themselves john kenneth galbraith wrote in 1966 that we now have a welfare system that could not be better designed to destroy incentive if we wanted it that way this is still the case as evidenced in the meagre us labour force participation rate of roughly 63 2 on par with those of ecuador and myanmar and roughly 18 shy of the uk ubi presents us with the unique opportunity to kill two birds with one stone proactively confront transformative economic change and tackle the distorting incentive structure found in the current welfare regime by emphasizing financial subsistence we can be rid of the scarcity mindset that diminishes both cognitive capacity and entrepreneurship by replacing it with a mindset of abundance which is to say that according to the roosevelt institute a monthly dividend of 1000 to every american over 18 would yield an additional 2 5 trillion of economic growth by 2025 that economic injection is intrinsically valuable as it implies a degree of bottom up growth that the digital economy won t produce the poor don t waste transfers on booze and cigarettes they increase consumption on household goods and services as the world bank found in 2014 of course there s the notable question of how we pay for it all a value added tax or vat at half the european level 10 will cover the majority of the cost combine that with the consolidation of those welfare programs that restrict choice create waste and distort incentives and you re there the vat is especially critical as it provides an avenue to harness the gains of automation and redistributes with greater efficacy than high level income taxes do there s also the legitimate concern that inflation will run rampant but with little discernible impact on the money supply these fears are largely unfounded there is but one democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination running on the implementation of ubi little known andrew yang he s branded himself as the antithesis of donald trump an asian guy who likes math perhaps the early frontrunners are too caught up in establishment politics to promote such a radical plan but it s somewhat ironic that the party claiming to hold dearly the interests of the working class has presented no strategic plan to navigate the digital economy and prevent social implosion yet my gut tells me that the copycat effect might take hold come the first primary debates i ll concede that ubi is highly imperfect not because of the sheer cost but because it doesn t strike at the crux of the issue if we consider honestly those who will be hit hardest by an ever digitizing economy it will be those in developing countries where resources are thin and safety nets weak europe nearly tore itself apart during the 2015 refugee crisis yet these catastrophes will only intensify as opportunity dries up for those seeking work in factories and call centres halfway across the globe even still ubi is a policy proposal surely worth considering the digital economy will widen the income gap by distributing the automation gains to a select few shareholders leaving the low skilled to whither that s an unsettling prospect in an already tense polarized age ubi can soften the blow by building an economy from the ground up thereby spurring consumption and curtailing the scarcity mindset the digital age may well be defined both by unprecedented ingenuity and widespread human idleness given the clear indications of such an outcome the realities of technological disruption should be at the forefront of every economic debate we d

it s a continuation of the perennial battle in financial markets the desire to take risk when financial conditions dictate its attractive to do so versus the desire to preserve capital when the economic growth environment is degrading policy makers are fighting hard to engender a confidence that the former can be trusted and will lead to an improvement in the latter 5 premier li s words fire up traders yesterday and the turnaround in sentiment began here it was china s policy makers turn to try and settle market participants nerves in a speech at the boao forum chinese premier li keqiang outlined his optimistic vision for his nation and stated his belief that the fundamentals of china s economy were inherently sound he did express that stimulatory measures would be undertaken to address any temporary underperformance in the economy though avoided pledging major monetary support however premier li made clear seemingly in an appeal to his peoples patriotic fervour and market participants animal spirits that china s economy is not because of internal problems but problems that pertain to weakness in the outside world 6 it s not us it s them it s a popular strategy at the moment amongst financial leaders actually when having to explain what s causing domestic problems just blame someone else it was manifest in premier li s speech yesterday but it was also a feature of ecb president mario draghi s recent discussions to the market as well as that of fed chair jerome powell the global economy as we know it is very interconnected so in some sense there is a kernel of truth in stating that weak economic fundamentals is a function of some external factor but when the centre of the argument is essentially to just point at the other guy it comes across less as policy discourse but more as a three stooges skit 7 the end of the month the positivity inspired by premier li s rallying call looks to have been discounted in the asx200 yesterday spi futures are pointing only to a very small gain at the open today high impact news is hard to come by today a lot of the event risk is loaded into next week now brexit drama will maintain relevance but its impact will be contained to a presently depreciating pound the stronger greenback is a minor theme to follow despite weaker us gdp figures the almighty dollar has smashed the currency complex and gold prices to tie everything back into rates and fixed income we wait to see whether agbs sell off too and whether bets of rba cuts are tempered too 8 market watch spi futures down 1 point to 6167 at about 7 40am aedt aud 0 1 to 70 77 us cents on wall st dow 0 4 s p 500 0 4 nasdaq 0 3 in new york bhp 0 3 rio 0 6 atlassian 1 4 lululemon 14 in europe stoxx 50 0 1 ftse 0 6 cac 0 1 dax 0 1 spot gold 1 4 to us1290 77 an ounce at 1 57pm new york brent crude 0 3 to us67 77 a barrel us oil 0 7 to us59 23 a barrel iron ore 0 5 to us84 68 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 7 to 614 yuan lme aluminium 0 4 to us1903 a tonne lme copper bid 0 4 to us6360 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 23 australia 1 45 5 year yield us 2 21 australia 1 41 10 year yield us 2 39 australia 1 72 germany 0 07 us australia 10 year yield gap as of 7 40am aedt 67 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig

listen to this article listen to this article president donald trump s latest pick help lead the federal reserve has received a rocky reception with top economists raising several red flags about whether stephen moore is qualified to be a governor of the world s most influential central bank moore is a former trump campaign adviser who helped design the 2017 tax cuts and the co authored trumponomics the economists say moore poses the distinct risk of injecting politics into an institution that strives to remain free of political influence when setting short term interest rates that can determine the path of employment inflation and overall growth he s merely a propagandist as far as i can tell said menzie chinn an economist at the university of wisconsin he makes just egregious mistakes in fact and theory even a prominent republican economist criticized the choice of moore after trump s announcement last week steve is a perfectly amiable guy but he does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job harvard university economist greg mankiw said in a blog post mankiw a former chairman of the white house council of economic advisers for president george w bush added it is time for senators sic to do their job mr moore should not be confirmed moore who has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups including the heritage foundation has taken a series of controversial stances about the fed despite acknowledging that he still needs to learn about how the regulator works he previously said that the fed should be scrapped in favor of the gold standard he called on the fed to hike rates during the great recession a move that could have further crippled the united states and he recently said that fed chairman jerome powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that in his opinion undermined the gains from trump s tax cuts the controversy took on a new dimension on wednesday when it was reported that he had a lien of more than 75 000

hikes in 2019 suggesting that moore was correct in his criticism of powell in an opinion piece in the wall street journal regardless of public criticism trump supports steve and is willing to go to bat for him clifton said when has establishment criticism stopped trump before especially when it comes to someone trump personally respects moore fits a profile of trump nominees who have largely

director of the center for monetary and financial alternatives at the libertarian cato institute a washington think tank selgin noted that moore has suggested that the fed set rates based off changes in commodity prices mistakenly claiming that former fed chairman paul volcker was guided by this principle when fighting a wave of inflation during the early 1980s moore has at times been openly hostile to the idea of a central bank saying that the united states should return to a gold standard an idea openly dismissed by past fed leaders such as ben bernanke as inefficient and unworkable in

a long time ago the tax was proposed by the gop and opposed by democrats it became law but it didn t last long illinois republicans have made it absolutely undeniably incontrovertibly indisputably unquestionably pick your adverb clear that they re opposed to gov j b pritzker s call for a graduated income tax to deal with the state s dire fiscal health consider all 44 gop representatives are signed up as sponsors or co sponsors to a resolution by house minority leader jim durkin r western springs hr 153 which argues a graduate tax would create added burdens and dissuade economic prosperity the so called progressive income tax punishes hard working middle class families and small businesses that make up the majority of the tax base and would mean turning our backs on illinois residents more tax hikes will not solve illinois fiscal problems pritzker s proposed 3 4 billion tax increase will lead to even more out migration of illinois families businesses and jobs tax and spend illinois democrats cannot be trusted with more of our tax dollars that is why illinois republicans stand united against the pritzker madigan tax hike republican state chairman tim schneider the truth is every state that has put in a graduated income tax the middle class always pays more that s what pritzker doesn t want known that s the truth and we ve got to get the truth out a recurrent campaign theme from former republican gov bruce rauner last year which better government association fact checkers said was not even close to accurate we rate it false given such disdain would you be surprised to learn that once upon a time illinois enacted a graduated income tax proposed by a conservative republican governor and passed by a gop majority legislature largely with downstate and republican votes as almost all chicagoans and most democrats opposed the plan well it s all true here s how it happened back in the winter of 1931 32 when the lion s share of state revenues still came from a state not local tax on real estate and personal property like automobiles household goods inventory and other effects the chief protagonist was louis l emmerson a conservative mt vernon merchant and banker and popular three term secretary of state who was elected governor in the 1928 national gop landslide that put herbert hoover in the white house and in illinois gave the gop margins of 81 72 in the house and 33 18 in the senate at the time the general assembly was elected from 51 districts 19 in cook county and 32 elsewhere under the 1870 constitution emmerson was a courageous executive who tried to cure the financial hangovers of the almost bankrupt cook county governments wrote the late robert p howard a former chicago tribune springfield correspondent in his excellent collection of illinois gubernatorial biographies mostly good and competent men he didn t foresee the depression no one did which became his biggest burden as it was hoover s as the economic crash took hold and illinoisans suffered emmerson appointed special relief commissions and called the general assembly into four special sessions the first convening on november 5 1931 his proclamation noted local and state governments in illinois are face to face with the most serious financial crisis in their history an untimely cook county property tax reassessment in 1928 meant tax collections were two years behind schedule and cook had not paid its share of state or local taxes during that time almost 550 million or 10 2 billion in today s dollars moreover the total statewide property tax base was down some 1 7 billion 32 billion inflation adjusted 20 percent lower than in 1928 due primarily to delay in the collection of taxes and shrinkage in the amount of money realized from local assessments the governments of chicago and cook county are unable to meet current bills to fulfill their financial obligations or to obtain additional credit and failure of cook county to pay its share of taxes has seriously handicapped the state government emmerson said property owners paid no taxes for two years and most of them set aside no reserves to meet the bills when they were finally presented the governor noted in the meantime an industrial depression reduced the income of property owners to such an extent that many of them found themselves unable to pay he added emmerson urged lawmakers to be guided by the general principle that there must be no increase in the burden of taxation but there should be a better distribution of that burden and receipts from new methods of taxation be used to reduce property taxes the preferred solution emmerson s tax conference reported to lawmakers with his blessing was an income tax with graduated rates every consideration points to the conclusion that the time has come for the enactment of a state income tax the panel said the fairest distribution of governmental burden yet devised has been accomplished by the federal income tax copied by 16 states with satisfactory results and the production of revenues at the expense of those best able to bear the burden going to an income tax was necessary to increase the taxpayer base to produce the needed revenue and also to spread the costs of government over a larger proportion of citizens than represented by real estate taxpayers which the committee deemed socially equitable and politically desirable the new revenue would go to replace state property taxes for local schools to provide financial assistance to relief efforts in cook and other counties and to underwrite grants to local school districts a legislative package embodying the commission s recommendations was filed in the senate a week later including sb 20 the income tax measure despite efforts largely by chicago democrats to water down or sidetrack the proposal the proposal cleared the senate 29 17 on december 16 and moved to the house here too the bill s supporters fended off hostile amendments and motions ultimately making only one notable change increasing to 2 500 from 2 000 the exemption for heads of families before approving the plan 78 59 on february 2 the senate accepted the house changes the next day 28 15 and emmerson signed the bill on february 22 contrary to what today s political observers might expect the roll calls in both chambers showed republicans solidly behind the plan democrats generally against and cook county lawmakers of both parties resolutely opposed in the senate final vote republicans supplied 24 of the 28 yes votes while chicago democrats were 11 of the 15 no votes the other four being chicago and suburban republicans three downstate democrats supported the plan as did two chicago republicans in all the measure was rejected by 17 of the 19 cook county senators the roll call was similar in the house of the 78 yes votes none came from cook county s 57 representatives 30 democrats and 27 republicans including one democrat and three republican suburbanites among the no votes was house speaker david e shanahan a republican from chicago s bridgeport neighborhood and the longest serving speaker in state history until his record was eclipsed by another south side irishman michael j madigan four downstate democrats also rejected the governor s plan forty five republicans and 33 democrats from the collar counties and downstate provided the margin of victory setting the stage for emmerson s signature on february 22 giving illinois its first ever income tax a graduated one to boot the new law contained six brackets with increasing rates income up to 1 000 would be taxed at 1 percent while increments from 1 000 to 4 000 would see a 2 percent rate the rate would be 3 percent up to 9 000 4 percent up to 16 000 5 percent to 25 000 and 6 percent for increments above that a single person would get a 1 000 exemption which jumped to 2 500 for family heads credits of 300 were included for children younger than 18 and dependents and homeowners could cut their income tax bills by 100 paid for property taxes adjusted for inflation the exemptions would be generous by today s standards almost 18 000 for a single person more than 46 000 for the head of a family and 5 600 for youngsters illinois current personal exemption is 2 225 worth just 120 in 1932 dollars emmerson s victory was short lived however exactly eight months after he signed sb 20 the illinois supreme court without dissent ruled the income tax law violated the revenue article of the 1870 constitution which limited the legislature s revenue raising powers to taxing property based on its value licensing occupations including specifically peddlers hawkers showmen and jugglers among others and franchises and privileges income is property the justices said and all taxes must be levied on property by valuation so an attempt to levy a tax upon property income by means of a graduated scale that increases in rate as applied to increases from personal property and earnings violates the constitutional provision with illinois finances still reeling from the great depression a year later emmerson s successor democrat henry horner and newly elected democratic legislative majorities enacted a new tax on an occupation selling tangible personal property at retail and the court gave its blessing to what s commonly known as the illinois sales tax not until 37 years after emmerson s setback did illinois finally establish an income tax when in 1969 republican gov richard b ogilvie and democratic chicago mayor richard j daley negotiated a flat rate tax at 2 5 percent for individuals and 4 percent for corporations this time a unanimous supreme court quickly upheld the measure ruling the tax was not imposed on property but rather on the privilege of earning or receiving income moreover the justices noted the 1870 revenue article also authorizes the legislature to tax other subjects or objects the statement in the 1932 decision that the general assembly is limited to property taxes occupation taxes or privilege taxes is disavowed the court said the following year illinois voters adopted a new constitution specifically permitting an income
