these vulture funds mauricio macri borrowed on the financial markets he claimed that everything would be fine since implementing neoliberal policies would make argentina more attractive to foreign investors and lenders international mainstream media supported him when invited to comment experts in economics presented macri s argentina as a success story issuing in 2017 bonds that would come to maturity one hundred years later 2117 was hailed as the ultimate proof of macri s pro market neoliberal success in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend in fact the success of those bonds had a completely different explanation the interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rate

decentralized central bank in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend their success was thus in no way evidence of the argentine economy s good health there is such a huge amount of capital intended for speculation and not for productive investment that any state that issues sovereign securities with a return that is higher than average is likely to find takers here is an example of comments to be found in the press heralding the 100 year bonds argentina sold 2 75 billion of a hotly demanded 100 year bond bond a bond is a stake in a debt issued by a company or governmental body the holder of the bond the creditor is entitled to interest and reimbursement of the principal if the company is listed the holder can also sell the bond on a stock exchange in u s dollars on monday just over a year after emerging from its latest default according to the government the south american country received 9 75 billion in orders for the bond as investors eyed a yield yield the income return on an investment this refers to the

very big amounts of money that are usually invested on the stock markets or financial markets need to lock in long term returns this reuters report clearly celebrates the country s achievement one year earlier in april 2016 reuters reported marking a rare bright spot among gloomy emerging markets argentina sold 16 5 billion of sovereign debt sovereign debt government debts or debts guaranteed by the government on tuesday in its first international bond issue since its record 2002 default investors seemed convinced of strategy argentina received offers worth 68 6 billion from investors around the world anybody will understand from such hyperbolic comments that major capitalist corporations all over the world were on the lookout for opportunities to obtain high yield by purchasing high risk securities it does not tell anything about argentina s economic health potential lenders such as investment funds or major banks thought that argentine securities would be guaranteed by the state of argentina and that if necessary they could seek favorable adjudication in the jurisdiction of new york they were right since the loan agreements were made in accordance with the law of the state of new york anyway they were also convinced that in case of necessity the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries would bail out the government of argentina so that it may repay its debt to private funds as it had always done another argument was the following argentina s underground resources are significant and if hard pressed argentina could increase production in order to meet lenders expectations in short in 2016 2017 while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital but the situation took a turn for the worse in 2018 as a consequence of several negative factors resulting from macri s policies such as a steep rise in the amount of interests to be paid which had to be financed by ever new loans massive flight of capital that was made possible by a most lax policy of complete freedom for capital to leave the country it showed that argentine capitalists had limited confidence in macri s future and preferred shopping elsewhere including buying argentine external debt securities in us dollars on wall street currency reserves sharply dropped production started to decline and argentina slipped into recession employment plummeted most people s purchasing power dropped as a consequence of the government s and bosses attacks as a result domestic consumption that accounted for 70 of argentina s gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another also dropped the argentine peso gradually sunk while 22 pesos bought one euro on 1st january 2018 32 pesos were needed on 16 june 2018 in this context in june 2018 macri called on the imf as foreign investors and argentine capitalists had anticipated the total credit promised by the imf rose to 57 billion with 44 1 billion actually paid up to now as a first step in june 2018 the amount of 50 billion had been announced and a few months later as the situation had not improved 7 more billion were added this is the highest ever loan granted by the imf the imf s loan to greece in 2010 was 30 billion as usual the imf demanded even stricter austerity policies that were even more unpopular than those already introduced by macri christine lagarde mauricio macri cc argentina indymedia org in october 2019 the argentine people turned away from macri and elected the peron political movement back into office after an intermission of four years alberto fernandez became president and cristina fernandez who was president from 2007 to 2015 vice president alberto and cristina are not related the cadtm s latin american and caribbean network cadtm ayna held its 8th annual assembly in preparation of alberto fernandez succeeding mauricio macri as president 10 december 2019 i participated in the meeting as well as in several talks and debates including one at the parliament of argentina i also gave four interviews fifteen minutes live on a popular private and anti macri tv channel a video for an information website connected with the main civil service trade union canal abierto one on the main website of the revolutionary left laizquierdadiario the daily paper of the left which has an average of two million visits per month and one to the main center left newspaper pagina 12 the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population in the days before macri left the presidency to the two fernandezs debt repayment was the most debated issue on the other hand we should emphasize that social and political movements in argentina are massive and well organized trade unions are still powerful the feminist movement is still able to mobilize on a large scale the unemployed too are well organized the cooperative movement is strong the various neoliberal experiments that started with the dictatorship 1976 1983 and that had their latest attempt under macri have not been able to fracture the argentine society and contrary to what is the case in neighboring chile education is free including at university level as indeed is health care the questions most often raised in argentine media during the november december 2019 period while the previous government had suspended repayment of part of the internal debt will the new government repay the accumulated debt and implement policies that have been rejected by a majority of the people what should be done with the imf agreements since the imf is expected to pay argentina 11 to 13 billion must the new government demand those payments or withdraw from them shouldn t argentina suspend debt repayment for two years so as to make sure that economic activity resumes properly and make later debt repayment sustainable this is a suggestion by martin guzman an argentine economist who teaches in new york and works with joseph stiglitz nobel laureate for economy guzman has just been appointed minister for economy and finance in alberto fernandez new government and a majority of the people clearly reject the imf whose deleterious impact on argentina is obvious to all and sundry it has to be remembered that after the second world war president juan domingo perón had turned down his country s adhesion to the imf an institution he exposed as an instrument of imperialism argentina only joined the imf in 1956 during the military dictatorship of general pedro eugenio aramburu silveti who overthrew the constitutional president juan domingo perón in 1955 twenty years later the imf actively supported the bloody dictatorship of general jorge rafael videla who was responsible for the assassination of over 30 000 left wing opponents in the 1990s the imf put argentina under pressure to turn it into one of the most active countries in terms of privatizations and structural adjustment structural adjustment economic policies imposed by the imf in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans structural adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the imf and the world bank the requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt structural adjustment usually combines the following elements devaluation of the national currency in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies rise in interest rates in order to attract international capital reduction of public expenditure streamlining of public services staff reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector etc massive privatisations reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products freezing of salaries to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation these saps have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries they have simultaneously led to higher prices because of a high vat rate and of the free market prices and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services among other factors imf this eventually resulted in the massive upheaval of december 2001 which led to the fall of president fernando de la rúa during the public lectures organized by attac cadtm in collaboration with some ten other associations in buenos aires from 27 to 29 november 2019 i had the opportunity as international spokesperson for the cadtm to put forward a number of proposals to face the argentine debt crisis those proposals are the result of wide ranging debates within the cadtm network this was also the case at a hearing held in the parliament of argentina on 27 november at the initiative of economist fernanda vallejos an mp in the new presidential majority see my contribution in spanish the following is a summary of my points and proposals there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself according to this doctrine a debt is deemed odious and nullified if it fulfils two conditions it was taken on against the interests of the nation the people or the state the creditors are unable to prove that they were unaware that the debt was contrary to the interests of the nation it is to be pointed out that the nature of the political regime or the government is not taken into consideration in the doctrine the deciding factor is the use that is made of the debt if a democratically elected government puts its population into debt against their best interest this debt may be deemed odious it is erroneous to say that only debts taken on by dictatorial regimes may be deemed odious see there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself it is fundamental that argentina unilaterally takes sovereign measures to improve its debt situation five principal examples pass laws prohibiting vulture funds suspend debt repayments bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities setting up a citizens debt audit repudiation of current agreements with the imf 1 pass laws prohibiting vulture funds as belgium showed in 2008 and again in 2015 it is possible to pass laws restricting vulture funds see renaud vivien analyse de la loi belge du 12 juillet 2015 contre les fonds vautours et de sa conformité au droit de l ue in french the act of law is quite simple an investment fund cannot reclaim sums superior to what it paid to acquire treasury bills in fact vulture funds purchase the sovereign debts of countries with repayment difficulties at junk prices and then apply legal pressure on the government concerned to pay in full and so make profits sometimes amounting to several hundred per cent of their initial layout if argentina passed a similar law it would have some protection against vulture funds if many countries did the same vulture funds would be neutralized the practice of designating foreign jurisdictions such as new york or london with laws that are favourable to creditors as competent in the case of sovereign debt litigations must end 2 suspend debt repayments suspending debt repayments is one of the possibilities that permit governments to deal with financial and or humanitarian crises the country may declare suspension unilaterally many have done so it was the case of argentina between 2001 and 2005 for a total of 80 billion and the benefits followed in a collective book published by oup in 2010 stiglitz claims that russia in 1998 and argentina in the 2000s are proof that a unilateral suspension of debt repayment can be beneficial for countries that make this decision both theory and evidence suggest that the threat of a cut off of credit has probably been exaggerated p 48 when a country succeeds in enforcing debt relief on its creditors and uses funds that were formerly meant for repayment in order to finance an expansionist tax policy this yields positive results under this scenario the number of the firms that are forced into bankruptcy is lowered both because of the lower interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation and because of the improved overall economic performance of the economy that follows as the economy strengthens government tax revenues increase again improving the fiscal position of the government all this means that the government s fiscal position is stronger going forward making it more not less likely that creditors will be willing to again provide finance p 48 in an article published in journal of development economics under the title the elusive costs of sovereign defaults eduardo levy yeyati and ugo panizza two economists who worked for the inter american development bank set out the findings of their thorough inquiry into defaulting in some forty countries one of their main conclusions is that default episodes mark the beginning of the economic recovery it couldn t be better put as was already done in 2001 argentina should not hesitate to declare a new unlimited suspension of payments the recuperated amounts could be used to stimulate consumer spending and economic activities favouring the population two years would appear to be a minimum period to achieve lasting results with the possibility of prolonging the period it is recommended to suspend selectively small savers and shareholders as well as public pension schemes should be exempted from suspension on the domestic debt this means that they would continue to be paid it is quite right to make this discrimination in order to protect the weaker investors and public institutions it is the big private investors and the imf who are to be defaulted 3 bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities argentine authorities should revive the practice of the first half of the 20th century that established lists of bond holders in the litigation between mexico and its creditors in the 1940s the creditors were obliged to make themselves known and have their certificates rubber stamped or be excluded from settlement this permitted the cancellation of 90 of the mexican debt see registering bond holders makes it possible to sort big and small private and public bond holders in order to favour small and public holders 4 setting up a citizens debt audit to have a clear idea of the stakes and sums involved and a solid legal arsenal it is essential to conduct an audit of the debt under citizens control an audit would show how much of the debt possibly an overwhelming part may be deemed illegal or odious and could be the way forward towards debt repudiation and or a unilateral restructuring the real reason the imf granted such a huge loan was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms 5 repudiation of current agreements with the imf as has been shown by many observers and argentine jurists the agreements made with the imf by mauricio macri are contrary to the country s and the people s interests when the imf granted a loan of 57 billion to the macri government it transgressed its own rules that state that the imf can only grant loans if as a consequence the borrowing country s debt becomes sustainable which is not at all the case as evidenced less than a year later macri also transgressed the argentine constitution that requires that the signature of such an agreement that has the value of an international treaty must be debated in parliament and then be ratified by parliament the real reason the loan was granted was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power in spite of the crisis and win the 2019 elections to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms as the argentine electors have disavowed macri s policies and macri had transgressed the argentine constitution the new government would have the right to refuse to validate the agreement this is a text book case of odious debt when a country sees regime change the new government is not held to respect the debts of its predecessors if they were taken on against the interest of the nation or the people and in the former regime s own advantage in this case to remain in power and it is clear that the imf directors were aware of the context it is important that argentina does not make the same errors of debt negotiation as in the 2002 2010 period see the analysis by maud bailly and eric toussaint the mixed fortunes of argentina s 2005 and 2010 debt restructuring the above measures should be part and parcel of a larger programme that would include capital controls socialization of the banking sector tax reforms measures against the extractivist exportation market model and ecological policies among others in conclusion a new situation will arise in argentina as from december 2019 a new government must face up to a serious debt crisis it is fundamental that a large popular social and political front be created in order by all necessary means to promote the solutions that will liberate the argentine people from the burden of illegitimate and odious debt translated by mike krolikowski and christine pagnoulle

more president donald trump shattered republican orthodoxy on an extraordinary range of economic policies in 2019 setting up a more populist record for him to tout during a 2020 campaign in which democrats already are slamming him for abandoning working people from trade to spending from the federal reserve to paid parental leave trump has embraced policy changes that historically are more in line with the approach of democrats than republicans in establishing a forceful role for government in setting the terms of the economy it is a sharp contrast to his first two years when his main achievements included cutting regulations and a significant tax overhaul that emphasized reducing corporate tax rates traditional bastions of policymaking for the gop trump has still pursued cuts to government spending that pinch poorer americans tightening rules on food stamp and allowing states to reduce medicaid enrollment for instance that have fueled constant democratic accusations he has betrayed voters advertisement but the breadth of trump s break with the gop is striking on trade trump has reached a phase one trade deal with china that reportedly includes promises to buy far more in u s exports he has completed a revamp of the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada that some liberals are cheering for labor protection and pharmaceutical policies trump co opted a demand from the left to urge the federal reserve to cut interest rates despite the relatively strong economy a position the central bank ultimately adopted after seeing signs the economic expansion might waver the president has blown away traditional gop concerns over the rising federal deficit cutting bipartisan deals to expand government spending and even extend a new paid leave benefit to the federal workforce he unilaterally implemented a farm bailout that could prove more expensive than the auto bailout was a decade ago a move that conservatives had criticized as wasting taxpayer dollars and while taking action against president barack obama s health care law in court the trump administration has avoided moves to immediately blow up the law while pushing to allow states to import cheaper prescription drugs a longtime liberal position opposed by many republicans trump s steps away from conservative economic orthodoxy have been building since the 2016 presidential campaign when he shocked gop elites on his way to a blowout victory in the republican primary but in many ways they appeared to reach their culmination in 2019 the administration this year has appeared to change its focus away from working with congress on more typical republican proposals and toward an increasing focused on populist priorities said william hoagland senior vice president at the bipartisan policy center and former republican staff director for the senate budget committee some analysts say the emphasis on populist economics could upend the 2020 presidential election as the issues that may have helped give democrats control of the house in the 2018 midterms particularly the attempt to repeal obamacare and the republican tax law could recede while other white house initiatives become more prominent the trump administration is likely to continue its aggressive trade actions in its fourth year turning to negotiations with the united kingdom europe and possibly india and vietnam said peter navarro assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy in an interview these economic priorities serve as a contrast with the highly partisan politics of impeachment which is expected to play out with a senate trial early next year democrats maintain trump sold out his working class base to the gop donor class after his election but the

percent growth in 2020 that could be a boon to the president s reelection prospects though democrats say americans are still hurt by stagnant wages and widespread economic anxiety trump s policies could still create longer term risk the surge in federal deficits and cuts to interest rates may limits the tools america has to respond to an economic downturn should one arrive in the final year of trump s first term or later and politically trump could remain vulnerable on health care a top concern among voters having overseen a rise in both costs and the number of people without insurance i really say it s mostly lip service said dean baker an economist at the left leaning center for economic and policy research of trump s populism while in office if you look at his big changes it s really the tax cut that went to the top 1 percent and there s no dispute from that the rich have really benefited and everyone else gets a show trump may point to steady economic growth and

particular loses its immediacy celinda lake a democratic pollster at lake research partners said that democratic elites such as lawmakers think tank leaders and consultants have been alarmed by trump s economic populism typically republicans offer things like the deficit and the stock market the upscale economic agenda but trump is trying to include the semblance of a working class economic agenda she said it isn t real when you look underneath the hood but it sure looks real absent an alternative trump s policy shift also illustrates his power over congressional republicans two core party constituencies for decades free market traders and deficit hawks are at risk of being effectively exiled from the gop as some republican lawmakers quietly fume at being sidelined repeatedly over policy matters i see the restraints coming off all over the place it s been a less cautious approach as trump has realized he doesn t have to pay attention to traditional republican advisers said ed dolan an economist at the niskanen center a libertarian leaning think tank there don t seem to be any conservative voices around him anymore that disagree with him less trade uncertainty lower interest rates and more government spending will mean an economy growing faster than it otherwise would even if expectations remain for a modest 2 percent growth in 2020 that could be a boon to the president s reelection prospects though democrats say americans are still hurt by stagnant wages and widespread economic anxiety trump s policies could still create longer term risk the surge in federal deficits and cuts to interest rates may limits the tools america has to respond to an economic downturn should one arrive in the final year of trump s first term or later and politically trump could remain vulnerable on health care a top concern among voters having overseen a rise in both costs and the number of people without insurance i really say it s mostly lip service said dean baker an economist at the left leaning center for economic and policy research of trump s populism while in office if you look at his big changes it s really the tax cut that went to the top 1 percent and there s no dispute from that the rich have really benefited and everyone else gets a show trump may point to steady economic growth and historically low unemployment numbers but critics say those are largely disconnected from his populist economic policies most of the jobs that have been created are in the services type industries his constituency in the middle of the country may not be helped by a lot of these policies said chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank and trying to change these forces of globalization it won t have an impact for 10 or 20 years if it happens at all these are very slow moving forces kayleigh mcenany a spokeswoman for trump s reelection campaign said in a statement trump promised to change decades of failed trade policy revive manufacturing and bring relief to middle class families he has done all that and more trump s presidency began with an unsuccessful effort to undo president obama s 2010 health care legislation which would have cut federal spending but also cost millions of americans their health insurance republicans then united successfully around a more than 1 5 trillion tax cut when trump first came into office the priorities he agreed with the tax bill repealing obamacare required legislation and so he needed hill republicans led by orthodox conservative paul d ryan said doug holtz eakin a republican economist and former director of the congressional budget office but since democrats gained control of the house starting in 2019 the white house has either had to compromise with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif or act unilaterally what changed this year is that for the policy issues on the table he could move unilaterally and he did holtz eakin said these are nontraditional republican positions and they have come to the fore in the past year among the most serious clashes with his own party has been over trade republicans have traditionally resisted tariffs and supported large business groups in their quest for expanding international markets democrats have typically led the charge to crack down on china trade practices and revamp nafta trump flipped this dynamic upside down after blasting america s trade relations with foreign nations as a presidential candidate trump took action on the issue by launching a trade war with china and slapping increasingly aggressive tariffs on other countries business groups that had been strongly supportive of the tax overhaul criticized trump for raising prices for american consumers and disrupting global supply chains trump s advisers were in the meantime willing to agree to significant concessions to house democrats and labor groups to seal a new trade agreement with canada and mexico angering some republicans but also earning the pact bipartisan cover trump s unique brand of populism is essentially an economic nationalism based on an america first perspective applied to both domestic policies and the international trade arena this revolution has repositioned the republican party into the party of the working class said navarro the trump trade adviser in the past republicans were willing to sacrifice our economy on the altar of national security but if you do that you wind up losing both perhaps just as surprising is how trump has upended the gop positions on both monetary and fiscal policy the president demanded federal reserve chair jerome powell reverse course and back off raising interest rates at the same time the president has rejected fed nominees pushed by traditional conservatives who likely would have raised rates it seems that appointments are fully on board for the critique leftists have been making about monetary policy said sam bell founder and policy director of employ america a left leaning organization advocating on economic policy a spending splurge under trump may mark an even more dramatic retreat in conservative economic policy as annual deficits have risen to close to 1 trillion despite the sustained run of economic growth trump campaigned on preventing cuts to social security and medicare largely bucking long standing gop calls to reduce the national deficit by targeting america s two large government programs in practice his administration has gone even further than avoiding cuts to those programs expanding federal spending in multiple budget deals while opportunistically using them to win concessions on other priorities such as space force trump s policy opportunism may be novel for american politics but his grab bag of economic positions fits a bigger global trend of conservative populists like boris johnson in the united kingdom who has pledged to increase spending on britain s national health program populist forces are a global phenomenon they cut across the traditional left right cleavage many populists aren t traditional free market neoliberals or fiscal conservatives in their economic policies said pippa norris a political scientist at harvard whether that will permanently remake the republican party on the other hand remains an open question republican lawmakers privately still believe the deficit is a problem and support free trade but they re not going to say that publicly because it s not where their voters are said brian riedl a budget analyst at the libertarian leaning manhattan institute i m not sure trump has changed the minds of republican lawmakers as much as he has won over the base and lawmakers understand crossing the president is political suicide
as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect

and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to

on 29 december 1989 japan s nikkei stock market index hit a high of 38 916 a milestone that proved to be the last hurrah of the country s asset inflated bubble economy a period of ostentatious consumption and overconfidence in the infallibility of japan inc what followed was a spectacular fall from the heights of the mid to late 1980s the stock market plummeted losing more than 2tn 1 5tn in value by december 1990 in the years that followed the japanese surveyed an alien landscape of restructuring code for cost cutting deflation and stagnation when the bubble party ended its hosts appeared to have no idea how to clean up the mess left by absurdly high share and property prices occasional outbreaks of nostalgia for the excesses of the boom years when the ground beneath the imperial palace was said to be worth more than the entire state of california have become a coping mechanism for a country now facing a new set of economic problems japan s 1980s bubble was the bursting start of a long adaption from a young fast growing economy to an ageing slow growth new normal says martin schulz senior economist at the fujitsu research institute it took until 2002 to bail out the banks from the real estate adjustment it took another 10 years to put the necessary supply side and social security reforms in place the benign impact of the global financial crisis has shown that japan s economy has fully adjusted to its new normal of slow but solid long term growth schulz adds that the economic policies of the current prime minister shinzo abe have done some good for a nation that remains a global powerhouse as the world s third largest economy abenomics is working to get innovation going again and to improve future expectations japan is now much better integrated in asia with its long term growth prospects its service economy is flourishing again and embraces digitalisation people find jobs well into retirement and the young generation is optimistic what s missing are better work life balances to enable families to have children again and a more proactive stance to deal with the long term debt overhang view image in fullscreen a section of the imperial

enthronement of a new emperor while akihito sought to bring the imperial family closer to ordinary people much of his three decades on the chrysanthemum throne which ended with his abdication this april was marked by policy drift and a creeping fear that japan s post bubble woes were merely the precursor to long term decline enter abe hawkish on defence and conservative on social issues but wedded to keynesian notions of the state as a benign spending force for economic good japan is back he declared when he became prime minister for the second time in late 2012 it wasn t long before optimism over abenomics at home and abroad began to chip away at the lost decades narrative that followed the bubble era the first two of abe s three arrows fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending and loose monetary policy from the bank of japan in the form of 0 interest rates and buying bonds off financial inistitutions in a process known as quantitative easing had the desired effect the nikkei began to rise though at about 24 000 points it is currently far from the levels of 30 years ago and export dependent manufacturers cheered a weaker yen but after seven years of abe who recently became japan s longest serving prime minister a more mixed picture is emerging there are more jobs than people to fill them and record numbers of tourists mainly from other parts of asia are bringing a glimmer of hope to depopulated regions view image in fullscreen shinzo abe recently became japan s longest serving prime minister photograph aflo rex shutterstock but there have been policy failures that highlight the perils of vowing to nudge japan out of its deflationary low growth orbit abe s attempt to achieve 2 inflation came up short the cpi rate is running at 0 5 and questions persist over corporate governance in the wake of the allegations against the former nissan chairman carlos ghosn growth in the japanese economy was 0 4 in the third quarter of this year but there are fears that soft global demand and the us china trade war will hit exports there is concern too that a recent rise in the consumption sales tax from 8 to 10 to address japan s public debt burden the highest in the industrial world and more than twice the size of its 5tn economy will weaken private consumption abe s first two arrows are still in flight with the government announcing a record budget this month that its architect hopes will buy his economic project time and win him support after a series of damaging political scandals it includes 13 2tn yen 121bn in public spending on disaster reconstruction infrastructure and scientific research designed to shield the economy from a possible slowdown caused by a us japan trade war and a post 2020 olympic hangover but critics say the third and most critical part of his programme structural reform looks more like a badly thrown dart than an arrow despite grim warnings about the failure to address the effects on long term growth of a super ageing declining population abe has encouraged more women to enter the workforce and relaxed immigration laws to allow a modest number of blue collar workers to fill gaps in pressurised sectors of the economy but much needed reform of the labour market corporate governance and healthcare have been slow to materialise monetary easing and fiscal stimulus were supposed to make room for structural reform says koichi nakano a politics professor at sophia university in tokyo but structural reform hasn t happened this means the japanese economy continues to depend on government steroids god knows what will happen after the olympics abe s economic policy gave him enough political capital to push through much of his rightwing agenda like the state secrets law and security legislation but the government can t continue to pump money into the economy and the bank of japan can t continue to subsidise japan inc it is telling that he never achieved his inflation target the fundamental weaknesses of the japanese economy have never been properly addressed

sixth week of the gr presidency by c a chandraprema courtesy the island no whinging and complaining no daily rants about the previous government business of governing back on track we are now past the fifth week of the gotabhaya rajapaksa presidency which officially began on november 18 but have not yet completed six weeks the six weeks will be completed only on january 2 that we are now rid of the raving lunacy of the yahapalana regime seems almost too good to be true but it is true the yahapalanites are no longer in charge we no longer have to switch on the tv and watch a demented yahapalana leader screaming into the camera that the raaajapaksas will be be jailed that they will be made to wear jumpers that they will be made to hang on to windows of the medamulana walauuwa that they should be reborn as earthworms so that they can be cut in two with a mammoty and more to that effect it was not just we sri lankans who realized that sri lanka had been taken over by madmen in january 2015 the whole world was aware of it when sri lanka was under siege in the un human rights council in 2012 2013 and 2014 there were a significant number of countries that supported us outright and voted in our favour yet another group while sympathizing with us and even speaking in our favour in the council refrained form voting due to pressure from the obama administration which they could not resist because they were dependent on the usa for security or foreign aid or trade both groups of countries were our friends in 2015 when the yahapalana government embarked on the self destructive course of co sponsoring resolutions against itself not one of these friendly countries joined sri lanka but chose to watch silently from the sidelines while sri lanka proceeded to shoot herself in her own rear end normally one would expect countries that were friendly with sri lanka to support any decision that the elected government of sri lanka takes and if sri lanka s elected government decides to try its own armed forces for war crimes at the behest of foreign powers then sri lanka s friends would be expected to shrug their shoulders and say well if that s what you want who are we to think that we know better and help sri lanka do whatever she wants that however was not how our international friends saw things they could see that sri lanka s new government was treading a path that would not do sri lanka any good and indeed would even jeopardize the interests of the entire bloc of non aligned nations hence not a single friendly country joined in the co sponsored resolutions that sri lanka passed against herself in the unhrc sri lanka was surrounded only by the traditional enemies of sri lanka when she co sponsored resolutions against herself in the council after 2015 no votes were taken because sri lanka was also a party to the resolutions our international friends were acutely aware that lunatics had taken over the reigns of power in sir lanka and they wanted no part in what sri lanka was doing to herself government by madmen in february 2018 on the day that campaigning closed for the local government elections held that year no less a personality than the auditor general of sri lanka called a press conference and announced publicly that he does not know how much sri lanka owes to foreign creditors he said that foreign loans had been taken by the previous rajapaksa government in a haphazard manner with foreign debt being taken on by certain state owned institutions as well in addition to the debt taken directly by the government and therefore nobody had kept track of how much the country owed to outside parties this was an extremely dangerous statement for a responsible state official like the auditor general to make this is the kind of statement that would make existing investors panic and withdraw their investments from the bond and stock markets and discourage any new investors from coming in after listening to the auditor general s revelations foreign investors in sri lanka should have been girding their loins to flee but the central bank of sri lanka issued an immediate correction and said that even though the auditor general says he does not know how much sri lanka owes foreign creditors they knew exactly how much sri lanka owed and to whom and that sri lanka had never defaulted on a payment and that that there was no need to panic it was not only the auditor general who said that he did not know how much sri lanka owes the president and prime minister of that government and many ministers were also in the habit of making public statements to the fact that sri lanka was in the midst of a huge debt crisis created by the previous government statements like these would have destroyed the economy of any other country the collapse in greece was brought about as a result of the greek government admitting that they had fudged the budget deficit figures and that their deficit was actually much larger than depicted officially but in sri lanka despite important functionaries of the government ranging from the president prime minister and auditor general falling over one another to say how much in debt the country was we did not suffer a similar fate the reason for this was because everybody in the world including friendly countries and investors knew that sri lanka had been taken over by madmen after january 9 2015 and their statements need not be taken at face value when prominent members of the government kept trying to accuse the previous government of taking on debt that could not be repaid the rajapaksa led joint opposition was forced to react and to point out that it was not the previous government that was responsible for the debt crisis and to bring to the attention of the public the quantum of foreign loans taken by the yahapalana government such matters have never been discussed publicly to such an extent under any previous government that this writer can remember truly there are guardian deities watching over this country we were ruled by raving madmen for five years and the country is still here the four guardian deities of sri lanka sri vishnu kataragama sumana saman and vibhishana have to be among the best there is in the world as far as guardian deities go after the yahapalanites captured the presidency in january 2015 they had to face the inconvenient reality that they had lied and conspired their way into power leaving the public reeling with shock and disbelief after the result of the presidential election was announced and they had to do something fast to consolidate their hold on power or risk defeat at the parliamentary elections that were to follow so they set about bribing the voter by increasing public sector monthly salaries by rs 10 000 and reducing the taxes on many essential foodstuffs thus at one and the same time government revenue decreased and expenditure increased resulting in the government having to make up the shortfall through borrowings the salary hike alone increased public expenditure by about usd 1 1 billion a year without any concommittant increase in government revenue when the salary increase went into the hands of the public with many families receiving an increase of rs 20 000 a month where both parents were state employees this led to a spending and importing frenzy leading to balance of payments problems then inevitably under the tutelage of the imf they started collecting taxes to raise revenue to meet the increased government expenditure at last a govt of doers not whingers within about a year the economic chickens had come home to roost and taxes were increased all round ultimately the public was actually made to pay for the privilege of having the lunatics whom they had elected to power running the country the total government debt which was rs 7 39 trillion at the time the yahapalana government came into power in january 2015 had skyrocketed to rs 12 64 trillion by the end of july 2019 an increase of 71 this due to no other reason than the expenditure incurred by the yahapalanites to get themselves elected to power at the parliamentary election of 2015 this is the worst crisis in public finances ever experienced in this country this country has never experienced such recklessness and irresponsibility in the management of public finances at any point in the past the unp government of 1977 when ronnie de mel was the finance minister had been very careful with public finances even chandrika kumaratunga despite her fish woman style of governance was never as reckless as the yahapalana government when it came to public finances in comparison to the yahapalanites even cbk was a paragon of probity and circumspection no government in its right senses would mess with public fiances because finally it is those wielding power who will have to deal with the consequences sooner rather than later and every government wants to extend its stay in power for as long as is possible this was the factor that brought self discipline into the system that commonsense however did not apply to the yahapalana government that is how government debt increased by over 71 in less than five years during which no investment was made on any major projects all that happened during the past five years is the completion of some of the projects that had been started by the previous mahinda rajapaksa government public finances today are in the worst state ever yet we have not heard any whinging or complaining by anybody in the new government saying that the country is in debt and that the government is helpless compare this with the persistent whinging by maithripala sirisena ranil wickremasinghe and virtually everyone else in the previous government to the effect that the rajapaksa government had taken on debt which could not be repaid despite this whinging for public consumption what the yahapalanites had actually inherited from the previous rajapaksa government was one of the strongest economies in asia the growth rate was second only to that of china the stock market was at its peak the rupee had been holding steady for years interest rates were the in the single digits development projects that had been dreamed of by many governments but could never be implemented were being built and the country was poised for an economic take off the change of government that took place in 2015 was undoubtedly the most destructive in sri lanka s post independence history it was like the sack of rome by the vandals while sacking rome and in the midst of the burning and pillaging the vandals were loudly complaining that the romans had been doing things the wrong way and that they had come to put things right for the people of rome from the time the yahapalana government came into power they kept claiming that the economy was in a bad shape when they took over and that it was their job to put things right this was obviously not true but they kept repeating it in the goebbelsian hope that if it is repeated often enough it will come to be accepted as the truth envy of the rajapaksas the yahapalanites came into power harbouring a visceral jealousy for what the rajapaksa government had achieved they claimed that all the infrastructure projects built by the rajapaksa government were white elephants they claimed that the economy was not doing as well as the rajapaksas claimed and that the figures had been cooked one of the first things that the yahapalanites did after capturing power was to redo the figures to show that the country had not been growing as fast as claimed by the rajapaksa government a time when we experienced a kind of insanity similar to that of yahapalana rule was when chandrika kumaratunga came into power in 1994 where the cbk government of 1994 to 2001 was closest to the yahapalana government was in the relentless persecution of the opposition however the similarities end there even the persecution of the opposition by the cbk government never reached the levels of the yahapalana government the insanity in that government was largely caused by the behavior cbk herself and her closest henchmen cbk however never claimed that the previous unp government had been cooking the books to make things look good at one tv appearance she in fact acknowledged that considerable development had taken place under the 1977 unp government the yahapalanites however came into power with the sole intention of claiming that the rajapaksa government had done nothing that was worthwhile slfp types always held the view that the unp was better than them in running the economy and especially in achieving high growth the unp types for their part always thought they were better than the slfp at running the economy that in fact had been the actual historical experience until the rajapaksas took over the slfp after 2005 for the first time in history the slfp started running the economy better than the unp this was obviously something that the unp types simply could not stomach even the terms used to describe the slfp baiyyas as against the unp toyiyas shows a certain snooty attitude of mind for the first time in history the rajapaksa led slfp outdid the unp in economic development by a margin that could never be closed this is obviously the reason why the unp expended so much powder and shot trying to denigrate the rajapaksa led slfp s achievements between 2006 and 2014 but the flatfooted incompetent ignorant and arrogant way the yahapalana government went about running the country has now ended up destroying for good the economic credentials of the unp after 2015 for the first time in history the economy went into a tailspin after a unp government took office the growth rate plummeted the stock market crashed now the historic roles have been reversed the unp have become baiyyas the mere sight of whom sends the economy into reverse gear and the slpp which has emerged out of the old slfp have become the new toiyyas the doers who can put the economy right the unp might as well now stop speaking in english and use only the vernacular they might as well drop the traditional unp attaire of jacket and tie and wear a traditional amude loin cloth instead the unp is now not a party of economic managers but a party of tree climbers at best what they are fit for is to shin up trees wearing amudes to pluck coconuts today less than six weeks into a new government the difference is palpable the english speaking tree climbers have been defeated and the economic managers are back all complaining and whinging has stopped even though the new government has inherited the biggest debt crisis that this country has ever faced no one has still spoken about it or complained when dr nandalal weerasinghe of the central bank was asked at a press conference last friday as to how much foreign debt will have to be paid back in the year 2020 he said it was about 4 8 billion usd without any doubt this country is in dire straits due to the debt crisis created by the yahapalana government but the only sign that the new government has given of a crisis are the austerity measures that have been adopted by everyone from the president downwards despite the debt crisis drastic tax cuts have been made in order to get the economy going again there was no unavoidable global reason for the lack of economic growth during the yahapalana government the economy was doing badly only due to their baneful presence as leaders of the country during the past five years countries like india and bangladesh were growing at unprecedented rates while sri lanka stagnated the international conditions were propitious for growth world crude oil prices were less than half of what it had been before 2015 and yet the yahapalana government failed to make any headway as of now the new government is engaged in an effort to jump start the economy if this government can t do it no one else can do it last month s election result showed that the people wanted the insanity of the past five years to come to an end the voters did ensure that it came to an end and how

economically the 2010s were a slow motion tragedy a needlessly wasted decade during which bad policy decisions and cynical politics condemned millions to unnecessary joblessness and hardship from the white house to congress to the fed there were failures in every corner of the government that combined to turn a crisis into a lingering ordeal it began in the catastrophic aftermath of the great recession depending on which economic indicator you look at the country s recovery from that disaster was either slow or extremely slow the official unemployment rate only returned to its pre crisis level in 2017 the share of americans ages 25 to 54 with a job which many economists now believe is a better barometer for the labor market only completed its rebound this past october almost a full 10 years after bottoming out advertisement it never should have taken this long for the u s to recuperate the reasons it did have everything to do with choices people in power made along the way advertisement advertisement advertisement the obama administration s stimulus bill which was expected to cost 787 billion when it passed was a historic effort to rescue the economy from collapse and yet still too small for the task this was known at the time in january 2009 new york times columnist paul krugman wrote that the administration s plan was unlikely to close more than half of the looming output gap and could easily end up doing less than a third of the job but inside the white house people were worried that a larger plan wouldn t be able to squeak through congress and that anything approaching the symbolically important 1 trillion mark would be dead on arrival years later christina romer the chair of obama s counsel of economic advisers explained that when she pushed for a larger stimulus i did raise with the president elect 800 billion is as big as we think it just has to be but if you went a trillion or 1 2 trillion that would be even better she was told it wasn t politically doable advertisement the politicos might have been right about not being able to do it democrats on capitol hill were skittish at the unprecedented numbers the bill required moderate republican votes to overcome a filibuster and rush limbaugh who for a while people were seriously calling the de facto head of the gop was busy railing against the porkulus perhaps 787 billion was the most that could ever have been done that merely means that our government collectively couldn t rise to the moment advertisement the undersized stimulus bill however was not nearly so damaging as the government s hard turn toward austerity following the tea party wave in 2010 the new class of arch conservative republicans arrived in washington demanding steep budget cuts and threatened to take the country s debt ceiling hostage in order to achieve them and they succeeded the manhattan institute has calculated that congress enacted 889 billion worth of spending cuts over the last six years of obama s term those combined with tax hikes and the waning stimulus spending acted as a powerful weight on the economy according to the hutchins center s fiscal impact measure federal budget policy was a net drag on gdp every quarter from 2011 through 2014 advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement it is impossible to know exactly how much of the gop s mania for budget cuts during the tea party era was the expression of sincere small government ideology and how much of it was pure partisan power politics aimed at kneecapping the administration given the party s willingness to ignore deficits during the bush and trump administrations and in some cases embrace the very keynesian ideas they once mocked see mulvaney mick it s hard not to assume that much of it was the latter advertisement but bad faith politicking isn t the only thing that makes washington s midrecovery turn to austerity so galling it s the way mainstream moderates and media figures abetted it by treating the national debt as an urgent crisis in the middle of what was effectively a depression paul ryan was hailed a serious wonk for advocating vast tax and spending cuts based on the press coverage you d have thought the bowles simpson deficit reduction committee was meeting to draft plans to divert an asteroid from smashing into earth obama himself tried and luckily failed to strike a grand bargain on debt reduction with house speaker john boehner there was a consensus to treat debt as a clear and present danger even at the moment when the economy desperately needed the government to spend more advertisement advertisement advertisement the obama administration s weak response to the foreclosure crisis which peaked during its first term was yet another self inflicted injury that slowed the recovery by leaving the housing market to spiral downward and households to struggle with their debts from 2009 through 2012 there were more than 9 4 million foreclosure filings in the u s according to attom data solutions in the face of this ever expanding sinkhole the white house erected a pair of cautious programs known as hamp and harp that were designed to let troubled borrowers lower their monthly mortgage payments but were plagued by design and implementation flaws and helped far fewer americans than expected where the administration promised that hamp would keep 4 million homeowners out of foreclosure for instance it only modified 1 1 million mortgages through 2012 and many beneficiaries later fell back behind on their payments anyway advertisement as a senator and presidential candidate obama had publicly supported more dramatic efforts to rescue homeowners specifically legislation that would have allowed so called cramdowns where judges could slash mortgage debt in bankruptcy court but as president he never put much muscle into the idea despite backing from some moderates in congress or pursued any of the other bold options that experts and even republicans had floated so why did he settle for a more tentative approach advertisement advertisement part of it was politics the white house worried that it would face backlash for helping irresponsible homeowners recall that the tea party started in name anyway when cnbc s rick santelli uncorked a rant from the floor of the chicago mercantile exchange about how the government was bailing out losers who couldn t pay their mortgages part of it was difficulty designing a working housing program posed all sorts of technical challenges and part of it was also a matter of priorities some of the administration s top economic officials particularly treasury secretary tim geithner believed that the only way to restore the economy to health was to fix the financial sector so it would lend and saw helping homeowners out of their unpayable debts as secondary at best according to one famous account geithner once suggested that the point of hamp was to foam the runway for banks meaning to protect their balance sheets by slowing down foreclosures a bit it implied he saw the housing rescue chiefly as a way to aid citibank rather than overextended families advertisement advertisement the federal reserve deserves a heaping portion of blame for our anemic recovery as well after the fall of lehman brothers the central bank took extraordinary measures to both save the global financial system and stimulate the u s economy often bucking conservative critics who warned hysterically about hyperinflation and demanded more hard money policies but in the later years it likely slowed the recovery by hiking interest rates prematurely in a bid to make sure inflation stayed in check advertisement it did this despite the fact that inflation was more or less nowhere to be seen the fed aims for 2 percent annual inflation year after year it missed that target yet policymakers still worried that rising prices were just around the corner the reason was that economists have traditionally believed in a relationship between unemployment and inflation known as the phillips curve where as the former falls the latter rises as the jobless rate declined the fed s models suggested that prices would finally go up they wanted to get ahead of the curve and prevent inflation from suddenly flaring up by raising rates early but slowly advertisement as economists adam ozimek and michael ferlez have documented the fed made a fundamental mistake over and over again its members underestimated how far the unemployment rate could fall before inflation would become a serious concern it s currently at 3 5 percent a historic low they weren t alone as early as 2014 and 2015 prominent mainstream economists were arguing that the u s had already reached full employment effectively that everyone who could conceivably get a job already had one the press contributed publishing stories about supposed shortages of construction workers and other skilled employees they were all wrong today americans are still coming out of the woodwork looking for jobs and the employment rate keeps rising advertisement advertisement advertisement how significant were the fed s errors its decision to increase rates in late 2015 likely contributed to what s come to be known as the mini recession of 2016 an industrial downturn that hit the midwest and may very well have boosted donald trump s presidential run the fed held off on hiking rates for another year but even then its increases probably came too fast too early ozimek and ferlez estimated that 1 million more americans might have had jobs in 2018 had the fed done a better job assessing the labor market advertisement the past 10 years could have been worse for the united states after all there are parts of europe that still have yet to heal entirely from the crisis meanwhile the job market is humming middle class incomes are believe it or not at all time highs growth looks pretty stable wages are rising compared with the cataclysmic recession that punctuated the aughts things are good even donald trump s trade war another needless self own didn t plunge the economy into another downturn in part because some people in power seem to have learned lessons from their past mistakes the federal reserve may have averted another recession by cutting rates three times this year and vowing to hold them down until it finally sees inflation actually rise above its target and stay there but this decade was not a slow march to a happy ending it was miscarriage of economic policymaking that left millions without work for far longer than they needed to be if we remember that and why it all happened maybe we won t have to go through it all again
for around 20 years now shorting japanese government bonds has been the ultimate widowmaker trade year after year punters reckoned it was time tokyo s unsustainable debt load dismal demographics and negligible growth would collide to panic markets send yields soaring and stampede invstors and year after year naysayers came up short profit wise might 2020 be the year the market finally cracks there are several reasons to worry that the world s second biggest debt arena is heading into a year of turbulence tax decline one tax revenues aren t rebounding since december 2012 prime minister shinzo abe s stimulus efforts managed to produce the longest expansion since the 1980s to offset the jump in borrowing needed to finance countless fiscal spending packages abe s government has hiked sales taxes twice the first in 2014 boosted consumption levies to 8 from 5 it triggered an immediate recession necessitating even greater bond issuance at the start of 2014 japan s debt to gross domestic product ratio was 232 5 by the end of 2019 it s seen topping 240 on the way to 250 that s even before considering the fallout from another sales tax hike in october that one to 10 on december 5 abe s cabinet announced a new stimulus jolt to offset the damage a replay of 2014 it telegraphed a sizable shortfall in tax collections and larger bond auctions as such observes fitch ratings japan s fiscal health is unlikely to improve demographic plunge this fits with recent rumblings from the international monetary fund its economists worry a fast aging and shrinking population is stymying tokyo s efforts to service a worsening debt burden in 2018 japan saw the lowest number of births since 1899 demographic trends will increase age related government spending particularly mandatory social security expenditures heightening fiscal sustainability concerns and potentially triggering bond market stress the imf argues in a recent report higher risk premia could increase debt service costs and refinancing risks for the sovereign with adverse feedback effects to the financial system and the real economy granted the coming borrowing binge might not seem daunting for a 5 trillion economy the headline figure amounts to about us 239 billion at some point though bond investors will object to being party to the cycle in which japan inc is trapped each pledge or effort to curb overall debt ends up falling short only to be subsumed by the next one boj obesity another worry is what happens when the market s biggest investor the bank of japan slims down at the start of each year traders bet this will be in one in which the boj tapers or goes even further reducing its titanic balance sheet since 2013 boj governor haruhiko kuroda s team has hoarded more than half of all outstanding government securities it has also cornered the stock market by snapping up more than 75 of exchange traded funds by the end of 2018 the boj s balance sheet exceeded the size of japan s entire economy yes you read that right and by april 2019 the boj became a top 10 shareholder in half of all tokyo listed companies that means the boj is a bigger stockholder than even japan s government pension investment fund the world s largest at the time analysts at zero hedge quipped somewhere brezhnev is spinning in his grave yet something notable is happening as 2020 approaches the boj is resisting adding more liquidity even as the federal reserve slashed rates and the trade war slammed exports kuroda co resisted pressure to act most recently on dec 19 exports fell 7 9 in november from a year earlier the 12th straight monthly drop business confidence is cratering while the 4 2 drop in industrial production in october was the biggest in nearly two years inflation rose just 0 5 in november a long way from the 2 target and that mild increase mind you was exaggerated by the october sales tax hike in part kuroda s team is worried about the banking sector in 2020 ultra low rates coupled with its negative bond yield policy make it hard for banks to say borrow cheaply via short dated securities and charge more for long term loans the boj s unprecedented stimulus has deadened bond trading on certain days not one single bond changes hands for markets used to the monetary equivalent of a pyramid scheme there s no telling how punters might react when they realize the boj is unwilling to refill the proverbial punchbowl endangered haven this gets us to the last worry investors voting with their feet as investors conclude that tax collection and boj largess has stalled japan s safe haven status is in jeopardy tokyo financial circles got a whiff of how that may play out on oct 1 the same day the latest sales tax hike when into effect that day the ministry of finance sold us 20 billion worth of 10 year bonds mof officials figured demand would be robust given that team abe was reaffirming its commitment to fiscal consolidation in fact the auction met the opposite fate demand as gauged by the ratio of bids to the number of securities on offer was the weakest since at least 2016 the result shook markets as far away as new york the boj doesn t have the firepower or global clout to tame every flareup in debt next year particularly as tokyo s finances deteriorate at the moment 10 year bond yields are just 0 01 ultimate safe asset still japan has two unique features going for it one nearly 90 of japanese bonds are held domestically reducing the odds of a global run on yen assets two they re the core financial asset held by virtually every sector of the economy if yields suddenly surge local governments banks companies pensions insurers endowments universities and fast growing ranks of retirees all get hurt this makes for a mutually assured destruction dynamic it disincentivizes massive sales and incentivizes the boj to work closely with the ministry of finance to keep the peace in bond land what next yet these unique features confront the secular trends mentioned earlier those are what tokyo needs to address if it s going to keep yields from skyrocketing in 2020 abe s government for example needs to demonstrate it can at least cap tokyo s runaway debt it must prove it can reign in demographic risks be it by via increased immigration or higher productivity it must hasten growth organically via structural reforms not increased

it s not true that all economists and central bankers hate cryptocurrencies and stablecoins it is my honor to be asked by a respected economist in the washington d c establishment to write this post for inclusion in his forthcoming book about the impact of fintech trends on monetary policy he and i have had ongoing dialogue for nearly a decade which started when i came across his awesome work in the collateral and repo markets following the financial crisis and expanded this year into a frequent dialogue about stablecoins and central bank digital currencies he has taught me a great deal when his book is published in early 2020 and i m able to write about it i ll be back to share more meanwhile he gave me permission to publish my unedited submission enjoy it is important to ask what problems are the new fintech platforms purporting to solve specifically regarding payments too many observers have false confidence in their belief that status quo payment systems work well ignoring two problems posed by traditional payment systems 1 the high but hidden cost of payment latency and 2 counterparty risk posed by traditional depository institutions those who ignore these problems are at risk of being blindsided by the trend that users will increasingly turn to these new payment systems precisely because they solve these two specific problems no group of payment system users experiences these problems more acutely than corporate treasurers especially those that move money across borders the high but hidden cost of payment latency status quo payment systems were designed to settle payments on a delayed net settlement basis rather than a real time gross settlement basis historically this made sense computer processing power and data storage were too expensive to consider settling payments on a gross basis until little more than a decade ago legacy payment systems were designed to live within these constraints by aggregating and then netting payments within correspondent banks which in turn settled on a net basis with central banks by design such systems minimized the total quantity of payments settled and historically each bank in the settlement chain processed transactions in batches usually overnight because each bank processed in sequence it normally took days for businesses to settle a payment there simply was no alternative that provided businesses a faster more efficient way to settle moreover until the early 1980s money and credit were created via fractional reserve methods exclusively within the traditional banking system i e not within securities markets as they are today until the early 1980s this multi layered fractionally reserved system design meant that the growth of m2 could be predicted fairly accurately by tracking the growth of the monetary base all the netting that happened within the banking system meant that central bank balance sheets could remain a small fraction of the size of system wide total money and credit outstanding before examining the rise of securities markets in credit creation and their impact on payment systems a critical question must be asked who funds the cost of such delays in payment settlement when a payment doesn t settle instantly someone carries the risk of the unsettled payment which includes both time value interest rate risk and the risk of default counterparty risk who funds this cost by definition either the financial system or non financial businesses must fund this cost answer by design the status quo financial system forces non financial businesses to shoulder this expense but here s the rub nonfinancial businesses usually have a higher weighted average cost of capital than financial businesses do consequently forcing nonfinancial businesses to shoulder the cost of payment latency is an economic inefficiency a deadweight loss on society to see this ponder this question if two parties are settling a payment and the cost of technology is no longer a constraint so that parties could settle the payment peer to peer nearly instantaneously i e as fast as the speed of light then why do interest rate and counterparty risks exist in payments these two risks are not inherent to payments they are introduced where they would not otherwise exist due to the delayed net settlement structure of the legacy payments system in other words counterparty and interest rate risks are exogenous factors in payments they exist only due to the design of the status quo financial system which is hostage to legacy constraints delaying settlement that need no longer exist today but which powerful incumbents are not very interested in changing as they capture rent seeking profits in the meantime to illustrate let s consider the example of a global company that manufactures technology components that has a global supply chain and that uses roughly 1 000 different bank accounts located around the world let s assume the company has no debt in its capital structure so that the company is 100 equity financed and that its weighted average cost of capital is 15 let s also assume that its cash management bank has a weighted average cost of capital of 3 in a pareto optimal world the cost of payment latency related to this company s payments would be borne by its bank whose weighted average cost of capital is 12 lower than that of the company 15 minus 3 however status quo payment systems incentivize the opposite specifically the company s bank can only assume a finite amount of credit exposure to the company so the bank allocates this credit risk budget to the highest margin products such as bridge financing for mergers acquisitions leveraged loans accelerated stock buyback programs deal contingent derivatives and other high margin products the last thing its bank wants to do is finance the company s payment latency which is a very low margin business consequently the bank requires the company to finance its own payment latency by trapping cash in its myriad bank accounts around the world in so called comfort deposits while the bank captures profits on this float but here s the problem this practice is a deadweight loss on society because this company s payment delays are financed by the company s own trapped capital which has a 15 cost instead of by the bank which has a 3 cost of capital the math i just outlined the company financing its own payment latency with expensive 15 cost capital provides a powerful incentive for the company s treasurer to seek more efficient payment solutions that enable the company to reduce the amount of capital it must trap in its own bank accounts companies with the highest cost of capital have the greatest incentive to use real time gross settlement systems which can minimize their trapped cash and speed up their balance sheet velocity relative to the status quo counterparty risk of depositories corporate treasurers also face another calculation that is not widely discussed they must manage cash balances that far exceed the limits of deposit insurance such as fdic insurance in the us and similar insurance limits in other countries consequently corporate treasurers must do something that few retail depositors have even thought about doing since the 1930s good old fashioned counterparty credit risk analysis on their deposit banks most corporate treasurers are highly sophisticated on this very topic even though this topic is barely discussed in the mainstream financial press for example owing to concerns about the creditworthiness of european banks by the early 2010s some of the largest and most sophisticated us companies had already transferred their european cash deposits to us money market funds and swapped back them to euros via the fx swaps market one more topic before wrapping up the discussion is not complete without returning to the topic of securities markets whose role in credit creation today is as important as that of the traditional banking system and in some countries even more important while corporate payments still settle on a delayed net basis within the traditional banking system what has changed since the 1980s is that banks now have the opportunity to finance themselves in both the traditional banking system and in global securities markets the us dollar remains the dominant intermediary currency of cross border trade and it is used daily in very high volume between non us parties transacting with other non us parties i e never directly touching the us financial system but transacting with the us dollar nonetheless some say correctly in my view that the so called eurodollar defined as a us dollar issued outside of the us rather than on shore in the us is really the world s reserve currency significant us dollar balances have accumulated outside of the us as global trade flourished outside of the us in other words outside of the federal reserve s direct control and even its ability to measure this trend began in earnest in the early 1980s and has accelerated since then as the trend accelerated two things started happening in the early 1990s 1 banks required other banks to post high quality liquid collateral to each other in order to collateralize their counterparty credit risk to each other and 2 the market for trading this collateral i e the repo market increasingly became the de facto lender of last resort yes arguably even more powerful than central banks in day to day operations the connection between the repo market and corporate payments isn t obvious and very little has been written about it however the two are highly intertwined the primary job of the financial sector after all is to intermediate transactions between nonfinancial businesses and indeed national statistics such as the federal reserve s z 1 data confirm that the financial sector s aggregate balance sheet is not that much bigger than that of the nonfinancial sector the problem as has noted many times in his research is that a significant quantity of us dollar liabilities have built offshore outside of the us banking system and it s impossible to measure the size of these us dollar liabilities accurately one possible way to gauge it is to measure the collateral backing these us dollar exposures in the repo market which is where this collateral changes hands yet owing to rehypothecation and other collateral re use practices the true magnitude of the offshore us dollar based credit exposures cannot be measured accurately in this manner either periodically when liquidity dries up in the repo and foreign exchange swap markets the shortage of us dollar collateral can cause the us dollar to spike which can trigger losses for businesses financial institutions and even countries that have short positions in the us dollar such instances beginning with the financial crisis in 2008 plus three subsequent instances since then lead corporate treasurers to hunker down and focus on the counterparty risk of their banks even more closely wrapping up what all this means for the future of payment systems here s the bottom line corporate treasurers have strong economic incentives to use real time gross settlement systems for payments especially if their company has a high weighted average cost of capital as true alternatives gain steam it makes no sense for corporate treasurers to keep using status quo systems which require them to keep capital trapped in bank accounts often to fund their own payments between their own subsidiaries around the world one mid capitalization technology company alone calculated that the benefit of speeding up payment settlement to same day was 200 million 200 million in other words the opportunity to strip out that much lazy capital from its capital structure is a powerful incentive for its corporate treasurer to switch payment systems owing to these strong economic incentives corporate treasurers will likely be among the first to jump to real time gross settlement systems as they gain momentum multiple fortune 500 companies have quietly been using bitcoin in small amounts since 2014 predominantly for transactions in countries without well developed banking systems readers should assume that corporate treasurers are up to speed on all developments in the faster payments area and are quickly able to pivot to solutions that make sense for them consequently i believe that if one of the big superregional central banks the federal reserve the bank of japan the bank of england or the ecb were to issue a central bank digital currency that offered real time gross settlement corporate treasurers would have a strong economic incentive to switch to it as an intermediary currency in global trade the us dollar s current supremacy in global trade is far from durable the switch to faster payments may take many forms from a central bank digital currency to a bank sponsored digital currency such as fnality or jpmcoin to a private stablecoin such as libra or tether to a decentralized cryptocurrency such as bitcoin as corporate payments migrate away from heavily netted systems toward gross systems central bank balance sheets are likely to need to expand but make no mistake the economic incentives for corporate treasurers to switch from legacy payment systems to new real time gross settlement systems are powerful the big questions are these which one and how fast
the perspective atlanta georgia december 28 2019 lured into populist rhetoric bewitched by political pageantry and robbed through hardcore electoral maneuverings the liberian people missed out on yet another chance in 2017 to choose real change over false hope it seems like they are gradually waking up from the scars of fantasy and ecstasy as though the liberian people were spellbound or entrapped into enchantment they made a risky choice to have experimented with a clueless and extravagant footballer who has zero knowledge in governance leadership and diplomacy the election of ex soccer star george weah has proven to be an experimento peligroso a dangerous experiment such an abysmal gamble has now landed liberia and liberians into a national catastrophe the future remains opaque as uncertainties loom on friday december 20 2019 president george m weah had yet another opportunity to rekindle lost hope renew public confidence and prove his critics wrong especially ahead of a popular protest on december 30 2019 in his first ever radio call in talk show with liberians president weah seemed to have provoked public discontent by ejecting baggage of subterfuges and tantrums instead of elevating sound policy prescriptions that offer sustained and concrete remedies or solutions to liberia s prevailing tragedy cdc political leader rambled in solecism and sophism for almost an hour during his incoherent interview after president weah s interview liberia still remains beyond stress level as hopelessness soars due to increasing hardship his message on december 20 2019 gave zero hope and zero assurance for a better future his poor performance has further impugned liberia s reputation both locally and internationally what really did liberians get from his interview the president s interview was never solution based policy driven and vision oriented as usual he was on yet another spree to lash out at opposition figures and shift the blame on his predecessor for handing over a broken economy with little or no hope renewed liberians remain wanderers and beggars in their own country as a result of governance breakdown and zero vision under cdc the problem of liberia seems far bigger than president weah and his confidants both abroad and at home president george forky klon jlaleh gbekugbeh tarpeh manneh oppong weah has abused a number of popular platforms and golden opportunities to deliver a strong message of hope revival and resilience amidst a collapsing republic under his reign like president weah failed for the second time in roll to fully maximize the world stage at this year s un general assembly he has also failed at home to reawaken his nation and people from slumber this has become a routine what a faux pas indeed as africa s oldest republic undergoes its toughest economic period coupled with rising political crises no real answer s has have been prescribed or derived by the weah s hegemony to cure prevailing woes his latest interview was too far from the real answer s hence this antithesis which is my first analysis from exile is primarily intended to unpack a number of contradictions and or debris of weah s incoherent interview into four 4 fundamentally parameters namely faux pas blunder fairy tale spider story farce mockery or comedy fantasy impossible imagination the interview of president george m weah fits in these parameters so well it was just an unarguable reflection of blunder spider story comedy and imagination till now the nation and its people remain bewildered and downcast by this interview it is safe to conclude that the cdc is an emblem of fake change and false hope the byproducts of weah s presidency and the cdc led government are increased poverty misery obscurity and ignominy the republic is truly in the state of trance and the new ruling class has lost its way faux pas addressing the liberian people president george m weah described prevailing economic challenges as serious but temporary did president weah say temporary it was a faux pas blunder on his part to have said this it seemed like he had zero knowledge of liberia s structural economic problems an economy like liberia s that has been and remains import based aid dependent and food insecure will always be vulnerable to shocks addressing the liberian people president george m weah described prevailing economic challenges asdid president weah say temporary it was a faux pas blunder on his part to have said this it seemed like he had zero knowledge of liberia s structural economic problems an economy like liberia s that has been and remains import based aid dependent and food insecure will always be vulnerable to shocks even up to now there is no concrete action in terms of engendering appropriate policy measures to shift from import based to export based the liberian economy is still dependent on traditional exports like iron ore rubber gold diamond cocoa coffee and timber amidst falling prices of these raw materials globally there is no concrete plan to add value to these commodities and hugely invest in economic diversification tourism entrepreneurship agriculture technology energy infrastructure etc the economic management team failed to furnish president weah with these declining economic stats or facts inflation rate 28 5 percent currency depreciation lrd 20 3 percent current account deficit 23 3 percent of gdp trade deficit 17 7 percent of gdp fiscal deficit 5 5 percent growth forecast 0 4 percent decline in output at the end of 2019 0 1 percent how can these economic challenges be temporary when almost everything sector area is declining under this pro poor government the president along with his emt has proposed investment in agriculture as a jump start to resolving liberia s economic crisis but this verbal proposal seems to be another fiasco it will interest you to know that the entire agriculture sector last fiscal year 2018 2019 received just us 7 851 066 which accounts for 1 3 of the national budget this is a violation of the regional threshold of at least 10 for all african nations ref the african union maputo declaration this 2019 2020 fiscal year the entire agriculture sector has a budget of us 6 208 754 are they honest about investing in agriculture the liberian leader again shifted the blame on his predecessor when he said it would be unreasonable for anyone to think that the magnitude of economic woes inherited by his administration would be resolved in a single month or in a single year this cliché of inheriting a broken economy is yet to be scientifically proven through any form of forensic audit even though his administration will clock 2 years on january 22 2020 where is the 116 page hand over note that was left by former president ellen johnson sirleaf why are they refusing to publish it the president said his government has paid the debts accrued by his predecessor amounting to us 9 million to lec and us 65 million to commercial banks but president weah failed to say that his administration has pushed liberia s debt stock to around us 1 2 billion in less than 2 years from about us 874 million after 12 years under ejs the impact of borrowing over us 326 million is yet to be felt or seen under president george m weah it is a blunder or a big mistake to run away from the facts or tasks and begin to shift blame there is no solution in blame shifting the president could not even justify why his government requested the infusion of l 4 billion and the printing of l 35 billion new banknotes 1 fairy tale spider story to even add currency to the blunder president weah said the entire economic issue is a supply and demand issue if we are facing economic hardship let the business people bring more products and the common citizens will buy them and they will make more money and money will be in the country this economic school of thought as espoused by president george weah is a fairytale spider story importing goods and services does not attract foreign currencies to the economy it does not necessarily increase the profit margin of business people import is a leakage in economics the country or economy loses more foreign currencies if business people bring in more products and if foreign currencies are in shortage as a result of this flawed economic proposal made by president weah inflation will rise steeply and local currency lrd will further depreciate the government should now focus on restraining imports and increasing exports amidst stagflation high inflation unemployment and low growth how will common citizens buy imported products when they have little or no purchasing power and zero savings how can common citizens especially civil servants buy goods and services when their salaries have been cut and harmonized amidst inflation how can this happen when the circular flow of money has collapsed under president weah the president s thoughts on the economy were punctuated by flaws weahnomics or tweahnomics the president needs to understand that the entire economic issue is not just a supply and demand issue it goes far beyond the president could not even proffer any real policy prescription on how his government intends to increase revenue base deal with inflation and depreciation expand economic growth service the debt stock invest in agriculture reduce food insecurity advance social welfare and improve livelihood add value to raw materials reduce high tariffs attract foreign direct investment promote private sector investment cut down on public waste and recurrent expenditure limit aid dependency invest in human capital restore confidence in our banking sector resolve liquidity crisis fight corruption tax evasion and fiscal indiscipline etc the fairytale spider story on the economy as narrated by president weah was enough for any listener to cut his her radio off 2 farce mockery or comedy the greatest mockery of this year was when president george weah publicly told over 70 000 civil servants during this festive season that salary delayed is not salary denied his statement has even solidified what his finance minister samuel d tweah recently said president weah was not elected to pay civil servants on time if weah was not elected to pay civil servants on time what was he elected to do to build private mansions and an empire of wealth these are mocking comments that have enraged the people this has even increased the momentum of december 30th protest any government that is unable to pay those who are honestly laboring for its success is not only unpatriotic and irresponsible but insensitive and an abuser of labor it was a complete farce for president george m weah to be calling for reconciliation and peace while at the same time lashing out at those he is extending an olive branch to the president abandoned the essence of his interview and began throwing jabs at former vice president joseph boakai he said boakai is an old man he was sick i paid his medical bills even the two cars he is riding today i bought them let boakai behave imagine a 53 year old president is addressing a 75 year old former vice president in such a disdainful manner especially in africa where are culture and tradition the president who is fronting for reconciliation is addressing opposition leaders in this manner he remarked i cannot waste my time on those people boakai urey and cummings cannot ask me to step down i am not going anywhere i defeated them in 2017 and if you bring all of them together i will defeat them again the president s quest to seek genuine peace and reconciliation is hypocritical and a betrayal of his own conscience furthermore it is a comedy to even think that he can beat up lp anc and alp combined these four 4 leading opposition political parties had 732 524 votes combined while his coalition for democratic change cdc npp and lpdp including mdr had 723 703 votes in 2017 presidential elections with increased public anger and internal cracks within the cdc the margin in favor of the opposition would be too wide in any impending election the recent montserrrado county senatorial by election is a unique example to reference the cdc was massively defeated in its stronghold by an opposition candidate 3 fantasy impossible imagination in his interview these were two 2 impossible imaginations voiced by the president 4 to think that the international monetary fund imf has a magic wand to perform a miracle in turning around liberia s worsening economic woes 5 to think that the war and economic crimes court will not be established in order to prosecute the war and economic criminals lately the entire government has been running to the imf for a solution the president said imf will help overcome the vexing economic challenges facing liberia the president needs to understand that the imf is a neoliberal and capitalist institution enrolling into its extended credit facility ecf program does not suggest an economic boom or recovery the imf focuses more on capital accumulation where is liberia after imf spent about us 1 2 billion for 12 years under ejs president weah and his emt must stop running to imf for a miracle to think that the imf has a magic wand to quickly cure liberia s economic malaise would be a form of fantasy impossible imagination on the issue of justice the president continues to shun retributive justice in his interview he made specific reference to the palava hut mechanism as opposed to establishing a war and economic crimes court the president has been dishonest and inconsistent about the wecc debate during the 2011 elections he declared full support for the establishment of a war and economic crimes court in 2018 at the un general assembly he changed his tongue and called for dialogue as a conflict resolution mechanism in 2019 at the unga he again leaned on the side of retributive justice wecc before this year can even end he has shifted gear in his latest interview to palava hut mechanism his interview further proposed interactive engagements with victims and perpetrators as a relevant step where really does the president stand on this matter whether he is for or against it is just another impossible imagination to think that this court wecc will not be established anytime soon the president again promised brighter days in his speech this repetitious promise seems to be more of an impossible imagination liberians are fatigued of too many hopeless promises they are set to express their disenchantment through a mass protest on december 30 since the president s interview failed to address the core issues and rekindle lost hope the masses will move into history on 12 30 as the cdc led government gradually crumbles from within and without the masses are resolved to send a resounding caveat and reclaim their socio economic and political destiny about the author

richard mahomva rebuilding the economy any frank retrospection on the state of the economy in our country would reveal that we have been through a very arduous phase the hostility of austerity was sharply felt the fuel shortages and nationwide blackouts continued to be a daily part of our experience but here we are the price hikes have been unbearable but still we survived 2020 must be better if we all unite against the sources of our economic challenges which have strong historical and structural rooting radical efforts must be put in place to guide economic policy making through it all the key lesson is that macro economic stability is earned as such fiscal discipline must continue to be entrenched in our economic governance culture production must be increased so that the living conditions of our people improve public accountability must be heightened in order to create confidence to the state and its economic development agenda the turn around initiatives unfolding courtesy of the transitional stabilisation programme tsp are part of the broad based strategies inclined to a strategic recuperating of industry tourism agriculture and other critical sectors of the economy a substantial hallmark footprints to this effect is closely linked to the return of the zim dollar zwl this critical policy turn comes in as an exigent step which has been long overdue in addressing the inflation crisis under the multi currency system zimbabwe adopted the multi currency regime in 2009 to curb the ruinous hyperinflation it has served its purpose and over stayed its welcome however in 2016 the government due to shortages of cash issued a surrogate currency the bond note which was trading along with the rtgs the multi currency basket composed of the united states dollar usd south african rand british pound botswana pula and a wide range of other foreign currencies but the usd was the widely spread currency in the market most goods and services prices were pegged at parallel market based rates this later invited the inter bank rating intervention by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz national dialogue 2019 also offered valuable lessons to the cause of national dialogue under the enabling structure of the political actors dialogue polad through polad all voices of dissent represented by the opposition have given mutual correlational traction with the ruling therefore no voice has been left out and no voice must usurp a prejudice inclined monopoly in such an important opportunity for zimbabwe to be in conversation this should build a long lasting premise for a migration from narrow structural bases of power to the broader apex of democracy today s decisive national dialogue must be located within the prism of the values of an open society born out of the transitional culture of the new zimbabwe the post election dialogue postures a constructive narrative and national psyche for lasting and collective defence of the values of constitutionalism democracy and good governance any dismissal of this long term political tolerance building initiative would be largely misguided and senselessly partisan and narcissist the call for dialogue by president emmerson mnangagwa vividly and lucidly instructs the rationale to decapitate split patriotic consciousness in our differences we must locate broader socio economic building aspirations of our country if our conflicting points of political interest do not recognise the essence of nationhood then we are doomed to fail the call for national dialogue epitomises a deliberate and much needed commitment to promoting political tolerance in the pursuit of a practical departure from toxic politics as we shift from the old to the new the patronage misdemeanours of the first republic must be buried in the past the mistakes of the past should mirror the direction for a long lasting culture to being united people sadc solidarities to the re engagement agenda the sadc resolution to push for the removal of sanctions against zimbabwe affirms the region s confidence in the second republic s renewed re angling of our nation s political economy affairs the electoral endorsement of president emmerson mnangagwa in 2018 was symbolic of the dignity which the second republic carries under the ruling zanu pf the conferment of this esteemed mandate to serve at the mercy of the people has inspired the ultimate decision reached by the entire sadc community to have president mnangagwa as the chair of the region s organ for politics defence and security cooperation the merited appointment of president mnangagwa as the chair of this strategic portfolio comes against a backdrop multi faceted neo colonial expedience mechanisms cladded in the detraction efforts of the opposition mdc alliance this explains why the recently choreographed protests august 16 coincided with president mnangagwa s assumption of this top sadc post the anticipated aim of the protest was to injure zimbabwe s credibility to be a key figure of politics security and defence diplomacy the idea was to co ordinate despondency with a view to agitate state security and give validation to the fabrications of the intensified whims of military hegemony in zimbabwe however the plan by the opposition to smear zimbabwe s qualifying position to lead this crucial sadc organ was devoid of the endorsement of the 2017 november transition by the rest of the continent the decision by the entire continent to endorse the narrowly queried november transition is symbolic of the enduring pan african position to defend the perpetuity of the liberation legacy the shared continental emotion to secure zimbabwe s liberation legacy was further affirmed by the sadc and entire african union election observer mission aueom in 2018 this was a broad gesture by the continent to usher zimbabwe into the second republic by means of a democratic process therefore president mnangagwa s regional appointment substantiates the extent to which the rest of southern africa has been following closely the key political and security related developments in zimbabwe this appointment serves an articulate position of the region to give sanctity to the reform path of our current political dispensation this further exposes the pitfalls of the local criticism to the mnangagwa administration president mnangagwa s current regional elevation crystallises the selective amnesia of the anti establishment cohorts bent on polarising zimbabwe in a bid to disfigure the success of the re engagement overdrive this is a clear benchmark of a high diplomatic score of zimbabwe under the able leadership of his excellency the president of the republic of zimbabwe cde emmerson mnangagwa sadc s support to zimbabwe in the fight against zidera reaffirms the organic political soul of the region which demystifies the morality of western interests in our sovereign political affairs this is why it makes sense for sadc as an anti colonial collective to demand for the removal of the eu and zidera sanctions imposed on zimbabwe these illegal sanctions are an antithesis to the spirit of african liberation inspired self determination for the first time under the leadership of president mnangagwa our fight against neo imperialism has attracted regional backing therefore it is not astonishing that the us is reacting the way it has done the continued attacks on the anti sanctions proposition by the opposition and its western proxies is telling of a deliberate asymmetrical warfare against the region s longstanding and unequivocal aspirations the lobby for the continued imposition of sanctions is not only reflective of the opposition s fight against zanu pf but the proposition to keep sanctions alive in zimbabwe is a fight against the region s united effort to fight against the hangovers of imperialism it must be noted that the need to consolidate the position on sanctions by mdc alliance in cohorts with the us embassy is not new the move reflects the perennial ideological position of the opposition and is telling of the role of the chamisa party as an accessory of imperial hegemony clearly it is undisputable that zanu pf still represents the broader continental aspirations as it continues to be a hub of rethinking the colonial matrix of power on the diametrically opposite it is somehow apparent that the slanders of the 25 october movement can only be antagonists of african solutions for african problems this is why the bloodline of their existence has been merely colonially financed from the outset the mdc was founded to manufacture false property and human rights to validate the zidera and eu sanctions going forward zanu pf must upscale its efforts to address the economic challenges faced by the ordinary citizens regional solidarities must be enhanced to give room for african solutions for african problems to give the idea of re engagement a meaningful impact in creating foreign direct investment

prime minister imran khan has declared 2020 the year of economic growth as indicators recognised by both domestic and international bodies show the country is on the road to economic stability the government had to take several unpopular decisions which is difficult for political governments but these painful measures have to be endured for long term dividends the steep slide of the rupee gave a reason to political rivals to heap scorn on the government now the rupee has become stable since august 2018 when the party came into power it inherited a weak economy mostly based on import oriented trade and activity a colossal current account deficit depleted foreign exchange reserves immediate repayment of debts worth rs10 billion and so on in all the country was on the brink of default recalling what a default means the prime minister explained to the corporate audience at the pakistan stock exchange top 25 companies awards ceremony in karachi the examples of latin american countries and lebanon while pakistan has survived the economic crunch and has attained the status of economic stability by moody s and the world bank the government must turn its directions towards creating jobs and alleviating poverty this can happen when investors have full faith in government policies and the private sector sees potential in investment admittedly the government has created a level playing field for investment and for this reason pakistan has jumped 28 points on ease of doing business index of the world bank more investment will follow as the government changes the rules of the top accountability department on dealing with businessmen while the government has taken several measures to facilitate the business sector now is the time to take tangible measures to provide relief to the commoner it can start with withdrawing or subsidising the recent hike in power price flaws of power distribution and the crime of thieving power gangs should not be passed on to the common consumers in the shape of automatic power adjustment nepra the power regulator body has announced an increase of rs1 56 per unit through fuel cost adjustment for october on the other hand increase in gas prices is imminent given the huge losses of the gas companies the right response to these woes is reforms in gas and power sectors it must be noted whereas the government has embarked reforms in tax and governance matters any such activity has yet to be seen in power and gas sectors

as the second decade of the 21st century comes to a close its most salient feature the plundering of humanity by a global financial oligarchy continues unabated amidst trade war and the growth of militarism and authoritarianism on the one side and an eruption of international strikes and protests by the working class against social inequality on the other the stock market is hitting record highs and the fortunes of the world s billionaires are continuing to surge on friday one day after all three major us stock indexes set new records bloomberg issued its end of year survey of the world s 500 richest people the bloomberg billionaires index reported that the oligarchs fortunes increased by a combined total of 1 2 trillion a 25 percent rise over 2018 their collective net worth now comes to 5 9 trillion to place this figure in some perspective these 500 individuals control more wealth than the gross domestic product of the united states at the end of the third quarter of 2019 which was 5 4 trillion the year s biggest gains went to france s bernard arnault who added 36 5 billion to his fortune bringing it above the rarified 100 billion level to 105 billion he knocked speculator warren buffett at 89 3 billion down to fourth place amazon boss jeff bezos lost nearly 9 billion due to a divorce settlement but maintained the top position with a net worth of 116 billion microsoft founder bill gates gained 22 7 billion for the year and held on to second place at 113 billion the 172 american billionaires on the bloomberg list added 500 billion with facebook s mark zuckerberg recording the year s biggest us gain at 27 3 billion placing him in fifth place worldwide with a net worth of 79 3 billion it is difficult to comprehend the true significance of such stratospheric sums in his 2016 book global inequality economist branko milanovic wrote a billion dollars is so far outside the usual experience of practically everyone on earth that the very quantity it implies is not easily understood suppose now that you inherited either 1 million or 1 billion and that you spent 1 000 every day it would take you less than three years to run through your inheritance in the first case and more than 2 700 years that is the time that separates us from homer s iliad to blow your inheritance in the second case the vast redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top of society is the outcome of a decades long process which was accelerated following the 2008 wall street crash it is not the result of impersonal and simply self activating processes rather the policies of capitalist governments and parties around the world nominally left as well as right have been dedicated to the ever greater impoverishment of the working class and enrichment of the ruling elite in the us the top one percent has captured all of the increase in national income over the past two decades and all of the increase in national wealth since the 2008 crash the main mechanism for this transfer of wealth has been the stock market and the policies of the us federal reserve and central banks internationally have been geared to providing cheap money to drive up stock prices the cost of this massive subsidy to the financial markets and the oligarchs has been paid by the working class in the form of social cuts mass layoffs the destruction of pensions and health benefits and the replacement of relatively secure and decent paying jobs with part time temporary and contingent gig positions since trump was inaugurated in january of 2017 pledging to slash corporate taxes lift regulations on big business and dramatically increase the military budget the dow has surged by 9 000 points this year trump and the financial markets applied massive pressure on the fed to reverse its efforts to normalize interest rates the fed complied carrying out three rate cuts and repeatedly assuring the markets it had no plans to raise rates in 2020 this windfall for the banks and hedge funds was supported by the democrats no less than the republicans in fact trump s economic policy has been given de facto support by the democratic party all down the line from his tax cuts for corporations and the rich to his attack on virtually all regulations on business even in the midst of impeachment carried out entirely on the grounds of national security and trump s supposed softness toward russia the democrats have voted by wide margins for trump s budget his anti chinese us mexico canada trade pact and his record 738 billion pentagon war budget this has included giving trump all the money he wants to build his border wall and carry out the mass incarceration and persecution of immigrants trump s pro corporate policies are an extension and expansion of those pursued by the obama administration it allocated trillions in taxpayer money to bail out the banks and flooded the financial markets with cheap credit driving up stock prices while imposing a 50 percent across the board cut in pay for newly hired autoworkers in its bailout of general motors and chrysler obama oversaw the closure of thousands of schools and the layoff of hundreds of thousands of teachers and enacted austerity budgets that slashed social programs two of those running for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination are billionaires tom steyer and michael bloomberg the latter with a net worth of 56 billion is the ninth richest person in the us he entered the race as the spokesman for oligarchs outraged over talk from bernie sanders and elizabeth warren of token tax increases on the super rich the oligarchs are not frightened by sanders and warren two longstanding defenders of the american ruling class who seek to mask their subservience to capital with talk of making the oligarchs pay their fair share a euphemism for defending their right to pillage the population the billionaires are frightened by the growth of mass opposition to capitalism that finds a distorted expression in support for the phony progressives in the democratic fold between them bloomberg and steyer have already spent 200 million of their own money in an effort to buy the election outright the impact of the policy of social plunder is seen in the deepening of a malignant social crisis in country after country in the us society is marching backwards as the crying need for schools hospitals affordable housing pensions the rebuilding of decrepit roads bridges transportation flood control water and sewage fire control and electricity grids is met with the official response there is no money the result three straight years of declining life expectancy record addiction and suicide rates devastating wildfires and floods electricity cut offs by profiteering utility companies and a climate crisis that cannot be addressed within the framework of a system dominated by a money mad plutocracy not a single serious social problem can be addressed under conditions where the ruling elite through its bribed parties and politicians aided by its pro capitalist trade unions and backed up by its courts police and troops diverts resources from society to the accumulation of ever more luxurious yachts mansions private islands and personal jets where social reform is impossible social revolution is inevitable the solution to the impasse is to be found in the growth of the class struggle the movement of workers and youth all over the world from mass strikes in france to strikes by autoworkers and teachers in the us protests in chile bolivia ecuador and brazil strikes and mass demonstrations in lebanon iran iraq and india reveals the social force that can and will put an end to capitalism the watchword must be in opposition to the corbyns the sanders the tsiprases and their pseudo left promoters expropriate the super rich this is the starting point for the replacement of capitalist private ownership of production with social ownership and international planning that is world socialist revolution
purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they are also an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators and then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it is scored positively if it is within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it is not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the yoy change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it is less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there is an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it is scored neutral if it is moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports november data included a decline in durable goods orders but a slight increase in â coreâ orders new home sales rose

are you eagerly awaiting retirement hopefully no excitement can be great but awaiting is not if you re eagerly planning for it you re in a much better position planning allows you to eliminate a great deal of uncertainty unfortunately few people are planning effectively a shocking percentage of people have little idea about how much retirement will cost one way to learn about retirement planning is to read seeking alpha our articles will contain some examples of how to prepare for retirement if you frequently read our articles you ll notice a strong emphasis on investing defensively we believe that investors should put a much greater emphasis on minimizing risk rather than swinging for the fences that doesn t mean investors need to hold most of their portfolio in cash or short term treasuries it simply means that they should focus on companies with a stronger financial position whether the investor is focused on common shares or preferred shares a safer balance sheet leads to a safer investment where can an investor find safer shares we built a tool called the safe income portfolio for subscribers it can be accessed with a couple of clicks on our service our risk rating scale runs from 1 to 5 for most companies a lower number indicates lower risk this portfolio creates an easy way for investors to filter out the lower quality reits we don t suggest that investors need to purchase every share in the portfolio instead investors should think of it as a buffet where we ve carefully evaluated each item for instance it includes avalonbay avb equity residential eqr camden property trust cpt equity lifestyle els and regency centers corp reg those examples include three apartment reits one manufactured housing reit and one strip center reit however there are several other reits that also qualify the chart below demonstrates how it works and includes 5 of the shares with a risk rating of 1 source the reit forum we also own positions in several shares that are included in the portfolio we believe this is a great time to focus on buying quality reits and preferred shares investing in housing wonder why apartment reits can be such a useful part of the overall portfolio think about the business of owning a rental near your home you would probably be pretty comfortable that the rental payments would usually come in if you ended up with a bad tenant it could be a nightmare though on the other hand the owner of an apartment reit has great management in place with their own legal team you have the benefit of steady income but you don t have to deal with problem tenants you also don t have to deal with fixing toilets air conditioning or sink drains the apartments have employees on staff to handle those issues so you can relax while the work is handled while we highlighted avb eqr and cpt for their low levels of risk we find the big seven apartment reits all come in pretty low on risk the other four are essex property trust ess mid america apartment communities nyse maa udr inc udr and aimco aiv none of those seven lands higher than a 2 5 on our risk rating scale that doesn t mean all apartment reits are low risk though we dove into each of the big seven apartment reits in our sector update on apartment reits outside of the big seven risk ratings scale dramatically higher the smaller reits take on dramatically more leverage and often pay significantly higher interest rates to reflect the risk why do they do it we believe the reasoning goes like this 1 more debt allows faster growth in ffo per share like earnings for a reit 2 more ffo per share may increase the share price 3 a higher share price makes it easier to issue new shares 4 issuing new shares creates a larger company 5 a larger company can pay bigger bonuses and salaries to management despite bigger bonuses and salaries we encourage investors to focus more on the larger reits why well there are a few reasons 1 the total compensation is smaller as a percentage of equity 2 the total compensation is smaller compared to revenue 3 the higher dollar amount enables the reit to attract the very best talent well usually 4 larger reits are more likely to attain investment grade credit ratings the superior risk profile allows them to borrow money at lower interest rates for instance you might see a higher quality reit financing 20 of the company with debt at an interest rate of 3 5 on the other hand you might see a smaller more speculative reit financing more than 70 of the company with debt at an interest rate above 4 4 this second reit takes dramatically more risk and pays more higher interest rate for each dollar of leverage in a recession guess which company plunges to zero most of the time it s the one with a huge load of debt as an investor which kind of company would you prefer do you like to gamble on hoping that the highly leveraged company will succeed do you prefer stability in your income knowing most of your stocks will survive the recession and keep their dividend payments coming if you re like us you prefer to focus on the company with more defensive management it may occasionally grow slower during the boom years but it can easily make up all of the lost ground during one or two bust years there s a big difference between a stock that falls by 30 going into a recession and one that falls by 85 if you re picking the stock that falls by 30 in a recession you ll only need to see it rally by 42 8 to get back to even if you picked the more highly leveraged stock that fell by 85 hey at least it didn t go to zero you ll need it to rally 566 7 to re attain the former glory that s why we go for the boring dividend grower with a solid balance sheet where do americans get retirement advice one of the common sources for information about retirement is friends or relatives source this is a great idea if you discuss the experiences with friends and relatives who are already retired it should be insightful however it s best to use those friends and relatives for ideas about retirement rather than for tax planning or stock picking simply going through retirement is a viable way to learn about the process and how it impacted their expenses buying an investment property when you re making plans for retirement you might think that you will want to buy a second home that s something many people thought but very few actually do you can likely toss that plan out 7 of people in australia thought they would be buying a property as an investment source only 1 actually did six out of 7 people planning to buy an investment property didn t follow through there are several great reasons not to follow through owning an investment property directly can be a substantial amount of work you are consistently on call as the landlord it can be a very effective way for people to make money in retirement however it s best suited to people who have some expertise in handyman work and who enjoy dealing with people if you own the property you will be dealing with people if you are paying a property manager you may be much better off with a reit when investors are picking a reit it s much better to pick a publicly traded reit publicly traded equity reits listed equity reits have thoroughly outperformed private equity investments in real estate source think about that chart for a moment over 25 years the gap between the publicly traded reits and the privately traded reits was 3 91 how much does 3 91 matter to your annual returns if the non traded reits improved their performance by delivering 50 more profit to investors it would take them from 7 16 to 10 74 they would still be behind the performance of publicly traded reits professionals managing your property reits have professional property management they get an exceptional scale on their operating expenses and the management almost is always competent if the management is incompetent we expect to discover that for you while i cannot screen every property manager for readers i do evaluate the quality of reit management why does the quality of management matter if you were hiring a property manager a poor manager could lead to higher vacancy or lower rental rate collections a good manager would attempt to avoid renting your property to any tenant with a significant chance of being evicted evictions are terrible for the landlord evictions are an enormous hassle and a loss of potential revenue the ideal tenant would always pay rent on time and stay in the property for several years to prevent any vacant time when we look at reits poor management decisions often lead to dividend cuts there are instances where a dividend cut is not a sign of poor management but there s a very high correlation between the two often investors will blame management for a dividend cut the challenge with that thinking is that they are only blaming management for the eventual symptom rather than for the underlying cause the cause is often excessive leverage when a reit has excessive leverage any reduction in revenues can create difficulties with their lenders much like a retiree owning a rental property the reit needs to make payments on any debt it uses an example of a company that handled leverage poorly was wheeler whlr on 6 23 2017 we wrote that whlr was dramatically overvalued because analysts fail at accounting let s look at how whlr performed compared to one of the strip center reits we liked much better brixmor property group brx even though both reits owned shopping centers brx delivered dramatically superior returns we didn t have a buy rating on brx at that time we did publish a buy rating for brx on 1 5 2018 though lower risk creates alpha we believe investors can improve their probability of success by focusing on reits with more conservative balance sheets that doesn t guarantee that the reit with a stronger balance sheet will deliver better investment results but it reduces the likelihood of implosion due to debt related issues in our experience over the long term the stronger balance sheets lead to better results because it prevents the reit from needing to liquidate properties when the economy is weaker this same principle can be applied to other types of companies as well by maintaining a strong balance sheet they are in a better position to negotiate with banks and other creditors many of our bullish ratings are on companies with risk ratings of 2 or below are you familiar with credit ratings a company with a bbb credit rating would often get a risk rating of 2 leverage you can think of leverage within the company in the same manner as leverage within your brokerage account if you wouldn t feel comfortable using a large amount of margin debt to increase your holdings you are in the same camp as me having a highly leveraged portfolio could force investors to dump positions at the worst possible times that doesn t mean investors should never use leverage but they should be very careful in choosing those opportunities if an investor is using leverage and the share price tanks the broker could force them to sell assets in the same manner a company s creditors could force them to sell assets after the values have declined those assets could be anything from bonds to buildings or manufacturing facilities regardless of which asset the company is forced to sell shareholders would rather see management making the decision about when to sell assets than having the creditors make the decision for them portfolio strategy there are three main portfolio strategies the first strategy is using etfs many etfs have excellent liquidity and significant diversification there s a great deal of research encouraging investors to simply mix shares of major stock index etfs with bond etfs the result is a portfolio with lower volatility compared to a pure equity portfolio here are some examples of etfs retirees may use for income that comes with a relatively low expense ratio high dividend etfs bond etfs preferred share etfs sector etfs vanguard dividend appreciation etf vig 1 71 ishares core us aggregate bond etf agg 2 70 ishares preferred and income securities etf pff 5 32 vanguard real estate etf vnq 4 57 vanguard high dividend yield etf vym 3 04 vanguard total bond market etf bnd 2 72 invesco preferred etf pgx 5 35 vanguard consumer staples etf vdc 2 61 schwab u s dividend equity etf schd 2 97 vanguard short term bond etf bsv 2 29 first trust preferred securities and income etf fpe 5 33 invesco qqq etf qqq 1 00 click to enlarge the second strategy is mixing etfs with individual stocks this can be a great technique for many investors it allows them to maintain diversification through the etfs but they also are able to pick individual stocks the individual stocks benefit from having no expense ratio and researching individual stocks can help the investor understand the market better we suggest that investors look to invest in larger companies with a healthy amount of research available these are several highly covered companies on seeking alpha consumer staples healthcare consumer discretionary technology others

mutual funds investors focusing exclusively on individual stocks and bonds will have less diversification but if they focus on lower risk stocks they can still keep the total portfolio volatility to a reasonable level individual securities or etfs let s dive a little deeper into this concept we can make a comparison between pff large preferred share etf and one preferred share this isn t just any individual preferred share though agncn agncn is a preferred share from agnc investment corp agnc we ve recommended the share to investors for years it has been in and out of our target buying range during that time but it spent a good chunk of the time within our target prices since agncn has a much better dividend yield than pff we need to include the dividends as part of the return wouldn t you prefer getting more income rather than less to evaluate the two investments for their volatility we don t need any fancy courses in statistics we can simply eyeball the lines that s right judge volatility by glancing at a chart we re charting how much an investor needed to invest on any given day to reach 100 000 today we assume dividends are reinvested to keep the comparison fair we refer to these charts as the 100k charts and we use them frequently source the reit forum you can tell at a glance that the blue line for pff is much more volatile than the red line for agncn you also can tell that agncn delivered superior returns over longer periods how can you see that just look to the left hand side of the chart if we use any date prior to late 2018 an investor buying agncn could ve invested a smaller amount to reach 100 000 today unfortunately agncn only has a little over two years of history if we want a longer term comparison we could use cmo e cmo pe cmo e was a little more volatile than agncn and carries a preferred share risk rating of 2 however you can see that cmo e s red line is still less volatile than the blue line for pff however an investor buying at any point in time before late 2018 would ve done materially better with cmo e than with pff much like agncn cmo e carries a materially higher yield than pff however it has demonstrated significantly less volatility even when measured over a period of nearly five years this opportunity for a solid total return driven by a high dividend yield and low volatility is the reason we like preferred shares so much we cover them at least every two weeks in our bi weekly series for subscribers the latest release is preferred shares week 182 dividend capture season i ll grant the name isn t very creative after 182 weeks you might expect a more exciting name on the other hand it does tell you precisely what s inside actual investor performance if we consider the actual returns achieved by the average investor over the last 20 years it s clear that they have significantly underperformed the major indexes source jpmorgan the best performing sector was reits but any major sector was a viable way to beat average investor performance there are a few techniques i believe investors can use to improve their results over time risk ratings and dividend coverage stocks with lower risk ratings should be less exposed to a dramatic decrease in value the risk ratings are driven by our assessments on a few factors how much leverage are they using how exposed is their real estate to the impacts of recessions how sustainable or growable is their dividend after we ask those three questions we ask one additional question do we see anything in their history dealings such as a bad external manager or accounting that raises red flags if we see any red flags it eliminates the possibility of a low risk rating if we don t spot any problems we go with the risk rating we initially calculated having zero red flags will not get a company an improved score it simply prevents a severely punished score we suggest investors emphasize looking at reits with modest amounts of leverage and very solid dividend coverage if we were to hit a recession revenue would fall for most reits consequently it s important that they cover the dividend with a margin of safety a solidly covered dividend with steady growth is a great sign of a strong company however dividend coverage can be difficult to measure some investors are looking at gaap earnings others want normalized earnings or they may use cash flow from operations or cash flow to equity for equity reits one of the most common metrics is ffo another tip turn off the news turn off the news i believe watching the news too frequently can cause investors to be caught up in the market sentiment investors should be wary of buying into the market s emotions it s important to recognize that investor emotion can have a significant impact on stock prices if you re watching the same news as many other investors you re being fed the same main stories precisely as they develop market emotions if investors want to invest on market emotion then they need to be able to have good mathematical and sentiment analysis for investors who are interested in forecasting the sentiment one of the best at this is avi gilburt who runs the market pinball wizard most of our research focuses on the fundamentals of each company but we also want to evaluate the impacts we are currently seeing from investor emotion and how we expect those factors to change in the future macroeconomic research perhaps you d rather look at macroeconomics without such an emphasis on emotion you re not going to get that watching the news on tv you ll need an alternative source for macroeconomic developments for instance eric basmajian runs a service called epb macro research in a recent article he stated the employment situation report for november showed a much larger monthly gain than was anticipated by consensus forecasters the expected increase of 180k jobs was smashed by an actual print of 266k furthermore the two month net revisions added back an additional 41k jobs manufacturing payrolls aided the total by posting the largest monthly increase 54k since 1998 due to the gm employees returning from the strike the unemployment rate dropped from 3 6 to 3 5 and the unemployment severity index which multiplies the unemployment rate by the average duration of unemployment also touched a cyclical low both measures indicate the level of imminent 3 months recession risk is very low source bloomberg epb macro research the spread between the underemployment rate and the unemployment rate also called the u6 u3 spread is at historically tight levels consistent with late stage labor market conditions u6 u3 unemployment spread total employment growth in year over year terms accelerated just five basis points to 1 47 the trend in the year over year growth rate is still definitively lower and at nearly the weakest level of this expansion focusing on the trend in the year over year growth rate is far more important than the takeaway from the headline monthly number or the unemployment rate the six month or 12 month trend in the year over year growth rate is almost never altered by the large revisions common with the employment report furthermore without an accompanying rise in productivity growth lower employment growth ensures lower rates of total output growth source epb macro research quoted with his prior permission eric s analysis is inherently different from what you would expect to see on the news it isn t filled with emotion and striving to keep the watcher through the commercials instead it leads investors through the key things they should know about macroeconomics and what those factors mean for the market if only the news aimed to deliver this kind of reporting recent developments 2019 has been an exceptional year for reit index funds even though we ve maintained a more conservative position than the index funds we re also enjoying dramatic gains on the year it has simply been a good time to be investing in reits we believe investors became excited about reits for a few reasons one is a greater knowledge of the impact of tax reform reit dividends benefit from the change in tax laws because their investors get a special deduction against the dividends the second factor is investors realizing bond yields are not simply going to shoot to the moon as yields continued to move lower reits powered higher for many investors reits offer more attractive income compared to bonds they get the tax break for reits and many offer higher yields than bonds most of the higher quality reits are delivering dividend growth as well while all those factors are reasonable reasons to include reits in the portfolio they were both visible in late december of 2018 yet december of 2018 was filled with fear from investors market prices were plunging across most indexes then the market pulled through and everything went back to normal except bond yields kept trending lower that trend of lower yields lasted until the last few months where we ve seen yields gradually trending higher again preparing your portfolio we believe investors should strive to be ready for the next panic whether it happens in six months or 16 one way to do that is to reduce exposure to higher risk investments after a major recovery instead we can utilize exposure to a few preferred shares with risk ratings of 1 or 2 we still collect yields around 7 to 8 but do so with far less volatility final thoughts a large percentage of people do not know how much money they will need to have saved for retirement further many of them could be getting advice from the wrong people seeking alpha offers retirees and future retirees investing wisdom and several different portfolio strategies we would recommend that each reader decides for themselves about the importance of etfs vs individual stocks in their portfolio either technique can work but we have found including individual stocks is a great way to take advantage of research on risk levels and valuations if your goal is a portfolio that generates solid dividend income and a little growth over time then you will want to consider adding reits and preferred shares into the mix the preferred shares bring higher yields and stable prices while picking a few high quality equity reits can add dividend growth to the equation
the conventional finance growth nexus suggests that a well functioning financial system is necessary to finance investments and support economic growth this pattern is seen in the united states united kingdom germany and japan the united states and the united kingdom showcase a market based model and germany and japan a bank based model china does not fit into either model while its banking system is dominated by the big four state owned banks its stock market did not open until the 1990s financing sources alternative to formal institutions markets and banks have played critical roles in funding the private sector that drives economic growth although financial reform is incomplete and slow in the context of china s broader transition from a state planned economy to a market oriented economy financial reform has come a long way between 1950 and 1978 china s financial system consisted of a single bank the people s bank of china pboc the pboc was a central government owned and controlled bank under the ministry of finance it served as both a central and commercial bank controlling about 93 per cent of total national financial assets and handling almost all financial transactions the first wave of structural change occurred between 1978 and 1984 the pboc departed from the finance ministry and became a separate entity four state owned banks were established to acquire the pboc s commercial banking businesses the bank of china industrial and commercial bank of china people s construction bank of china and agricultural bank of china partially local government owned regional banks rural credit cooperatives urban credit cooperatives and non bank financial intermediaries also proliferated during the 1980s the 1990s saw the establishment and rapid growth of the shanghai stock exchange and shenzhen stock exchange institutional investors such as mutual funds also emerged in this period competition from foreign financial institutions increased after china entered the world trade organization in 2001 in the past two decades numerous legal institutional and regulatory bodies were established to improve the efficiency of banks and markets the dominance of the big four banks in the banking system has been significantly reduced and banking sophistication improved in contrast to preferential credit allocation to state owned enterprises soes banks now use an internal credit rating system and align loan officers incentives with compensation and bonus schemes related to risk management waves of systematic efforts through capital rejection or debt restructuring have been taken to address non performing loan issues the small and medium enterprises and growth enterprises market boards were introduced to the stock exchange to improve the market s funding function there s also been substantial progress in internationalising the market with the shanghai hong kong connect the shenzhen hong kong connect and the shanghai london connect these investment channels improve cross border capital flows while capital controls are still in place the bond market has also grown in recent years but the transition is slow and incomplete state allocation through the banking system remains politically rather than economically determined not only does it distort allocation between the state and private sector it also distorts the allocation between the real production sector and real estate market system reform and economic growth are endogenous it is unclear whether financial reform has led to economic growth or reacted to economic development it is also unclear whether this financial development has been sufficient so as not to impede economic growth substantial inefficiency remains in the banking sector such as high overhead costs proxies for the formal financial system such as the banking system and capital markets have little effect on regional industrial agglomeration shadow banking played a positive role in financing entrepreneurial activities that constrained access to finance in the 1980s but the government s massive 2009 stimulus to rescue the export sector led to a dramatic expansion in new types of shadow banking with less positive outcomes the performance of domestically listed firms has also been poor relative to firms in large developed and emerging markets as well as externally listed and matched unlisted chinese firms deficiencies in the market s institutional features such as initial public offerings delisting mechanisms and corporate governance also partially contribute to problems alternative financing channels and governance mechanisms have played a critical role in promoting growth in the chinese economy funding sources come from family relatives informal lending agents and retained earnings these financing channels rely on relationships and reputations for information pricing monitoring and resolving conflicts compared to other major emerging economies such as brazil and indonesia china is not an outlier but average in using these alternative financing channels more research is needed to understand the chinese experience and determine whether similar mechanisms are behind the growth of other economies recent fintech developments also contribute to the chinese financing system such as crowdfunding peer to peer networks for entrepreneurs and alipay and wechat pay for retail transactions despite continued regulative and financial reform the development of china s financial system and overall economic growth still do not converge towards those systems found in the west in spite of the conventional wisdom adopting the us system may not be optimal it may be best for china to develop its own financial system instead of simply adopting one this experimental approach is reflected in many of china s current finance reform policies meijun qian is professor at the research school of finance actuarial studies and statistics rsfas the australian national university
looking back at 2019 is incredibly disorienting the country is horribly divided in fact the president of the united states was just impeached along partisan lines the government is running trillion dollar and growing annual budget deficits even though the economy is doing well still listening to many politicians and pundits you d think the nation is doing terribly and the government isn t spending a dime that s 2019 in a nutshell the economy is entering its 11th year of expansion poverty is at an all time low so are african american and hispanic unemployment rates the 3 5 overall unemployment rate hasn t been that low since 1969 the unemployment rate for women hasn t been this low since 1952 the employment rate for workers ages 25 to 54 is finally back above its pre great recession level wages are on the rise especially at the bottom of the income distribution the stock market is on fire small businesses and many industries are complaining that they can t find enough workers to fill all the jobs they have not everything is perfect of course there s still relative poverty but that s an immutable fact of life and of the way we define poverty many economists are concerned that productivity isn t growing as fast as it could this matters because productivity growth is an important source of rising living standards manufacturing isn t doing great either thanks to the president s self destructive trade war farmers are hurting badly due to the tariffs as are many of the companies downstream of the tax yet the economy continues to show resilience in spite of this so what explains the gargantuan budget deficits during good times spending on many programs meant to alleviate poverty and economic hardship typically goes down but not as much anymore ever easier eligibility for programs like food stamps have deviated from the program s original intent medicare and medicaid expansion have guaranteed that the programs will continue growing and adding to the deficit whether times are good or bad both political parties are carelessly spending on a whim they just passed a spending package of 1 4 trillion alongside 500 billion in irresponsible tax breaks and democrats are actively trying to restore the state and local tax deduction or salt a handout to rich people in high tax states more intriguing is the political discourse listening to democratic presidential candidates you d think that americans are living in abject poverty that can only be remedied by government taking over all student debt all medical costs and boosting the incomes of a politically powerful group who are already overrepresented in the top income quintile namely seniors listening to republicans you d think that it s never been as hard to be a woman or raise a family in america in fact gopers today call for programs like mandated paid leave which they assert is an idea whose time has finally come and large increases in the child tax credit others condemn the free market system as if it hasn t delivered anything but grief to low skilled workers and destruction to the environment the truth is quite different when the economy is doing well most people do well including women and their families more importantly it s the same free market economy that republicans and democrats today so vociferously condemn that has produced the wealth that everyone takes for granted according to research from the massachusetts institute of technology in order to get the standard of living that ordinary americans enjoyed in 1975 today we would only have to work 23 weeks out of the year to achieve 1950 s standard of living now requires a mere 11 weeks of work people were fairly content back then in fact many who complain that the free market has failed us point to those decades as america s golden age this is an illusion of course most of us make the choice to work more and acquire a significantly better living standard yet few people realize and appreciate how very much more we have now at the end of this year then i d venture to guess that the problem in 2019 isn t that free markets don t work but that we may have reached peak entitlement mentality let s hope we come back to earth in 2020 and start to appreciate that while all isn t perfect we re incredibly lucky to be alive today happy new year to all of you veronique de rugy is a senior research fellow at the mercatus center at george mason university a columnist for reason magazine and the washington examiner and blogs about ecomomics for national review click here to contact her and follow her on twitter veroderugy click here to read previous columns the opinions expressed are her own related stories
dear editor i refer to a letter from charles sohan in the december 13th 2019 edition of stabroek news captioned aquaculture will not return guysuco to profitability contained in the drivel that sohan writes are his statements that the government cannot run anything that i have no real evidence that aquaculture is much more lucrative than sugar that i presided over the closure of versailles and then houston and that all sugar lands are as valuable as houston s land i know sohan he is a nearly 90 year old former hydraulics engineer who incidentally never worked in the sugar industry at any level whose entire knowledge of sugar was gleaned from me this is the third time that this man has attacked me and i can t understand why first i want to address this sentence from sohan s missive ironically mr vieira during his management of the versailles and houston sugar estates and subsequent guidance of their closures never suggested that their sugar lands be converted into aquaculture ponds to return the estates to profitability but he finds it compelling to propound that guysuco should do so now editor i never even worked at houston much less managed it or closed it guysuco closed the versailles factory in 1987 this decision had nothing to do with me mr harold davis and the board of guysuco closed it since it belonged to guysuco and they built a waterway between versailles and uitvlugt and it was an economic disaster for versailles which was supplying cane to the uitvlugt factory versailles was forced to sell land to guysuco around 1990 because the waterway was such a big disaster that in three years it placed versailles in a debt we literally could not repay i imagine that the same thing is presently happening to the poor cane farmers at wales so to summarize 1 guysuco closed the versailles factory not the vieira family who did not own it 2 guysuco built a waterway between versailles and uitvlugt which was a total economic disaster for the owners of the versailles cane lands and its workers and 3 we had to sell 800 acres to guysuco to pay the 11 million dollars in losses we made between 1987 to 1990 due to the closure of the factory 800 acres to pay an 11 million guyana dollars debt because the socialist concept of the burnham government at the time was that the government was not going to buy cane lands from private people even transported land only the developmental costs and the bad way the waterway was run by guysuco it was the ultimate irony to have to pay the people who closed the factory built a waterway which never worked which caused versailles to make massive losses and had to give away its land to guysuco for losses caused by guysuco after it finally went bankrupt a liquidator barcellos narine was appointed to dispose of the land over time even at houston we had to sell land to banks dih to finance our losses trying to grow the sugar cane plant under guyana s political and other conditions one of my brothers who had established a fishing business actually guaranteed a 10 million dollar loan for houston at demerara bank to finance its losses editor it is unreasonable to believe that guysuco has been in serious trouble for several decades and was depending on government bailouts and loans to survive but the vieiras using the workers with exactly the same union conditions as guysuco were making big money from it so charlie the reason why i am suggesting guysuco make the conversion to aquaculture and not my family is simple to do such a conversion you would have to have deep pockets a company forced to abandon cane growing because it is bankrupt like versailles and houston cannot even think of converting to aquaculture it is why the government of guyana faced with the problems it now faces in the sugar industry and the political problems it represents to the electorate in this case nearly 50 must think very seriously about guysuco s diversification and continuity since they must dip into the consolidated fund to establish the aquaculture industry but it is not only economically feasible which cane is not it s a political imperative that they provide employment to people who have given their lives to that industry in any event small scale aquaculture operations very rarely succeed for it to succeed you must integrate everything manufacture the feed process the fish to fillets flying it to the us markets as fresh catch within 36 hours of catch packed in ice and not frozen etc every letter i ever wrote carries one message if a state owned enterprise is being badly run do like desmond hoyte and hire competent international management teams to run it we as a nation already learned this lesson in 1987 why are our public officials not aware of it well it is my opinion that they are not made to be aware of it because we don t make them answerable to us if we were holding them to account they would be forced to remember the lessons of the past and i am stating now that the local management team of guysuco is not up to the task to turn guysuco around now nicil is also not up to the task and are confusing the situation because they themselves don t know what they are doing the union officials are right this time guysuco having shed the estates which were making losses despite promises to the electorate are still making losses with the retained estates we must hire an international team to run it i even made the reference to the fact that robert persaud in 2007 removed the booker tate management team placed there by desmond hoyte and contributed most to the collapse we now see going on in the industry in 2004 the industry with booker tate managing it produced 235 000 tonnes of sugar it was the last time we produced anywhere close to 200 000 tonnes sohan is wrong guyana has the potential to become a world class producer of farm raised fish it is now confirmed by a world class aquaculture expert brought here by guysuco in 2015 2016 and if i had to choose a place on this planet which at this time is the most unsuitable for the growing of sugar cane today this country s coastal plain will be my first choice on the other hand if i were to look worldwide to select a place to establish aqua farming guyana would be among the top 5 places which i would pick finally editor my family carried on the production of sugar cane for nearly three fourths of a century at houston through world wars the 60 s disturbances in guyana when our cane was burnt and aqueducts were bombed and throughout the past 40 years when no country i can think of had more strikes by the workers than the guyana sugar industry and our workers belonged to the same unions mpca and then gawu as bookers and then guysuco we persevered through the years of uncertain transition to socialism the failing foreign exchange situation to buy raw materials for the cultivation some years we even bought our raw materials at g 20 us 1 to the us but we were paid at an exchange rate of g 6 us 1 for our produce until president hoyte established the cambios we weathered the massive upheavals in oil prices of the 70 s the fluctuating sugar prices worldwide in the 70 s and 80 s the sugar levy and the local subsidy of sugar and the withdrawal of the preferential prices for sugar at the eu guysuco can t have been failing economically for decades but we did not that concept flies in the face of reason and i am giving due notice i am prepared to handle anyone in court who thinks that we benefited financially from these lands in any significant way over the years and want to victimize us now it is an illusion guyana benefited much more since every ounce of sugar produced at versailles and houston was sold by the government to replenish the foreign exchange of the country we owe the fact that we still have this land due to two great men my grandfather manoel vieira who bought it and my father joseph vieira who was an outstanding estate manager maybe even the best in our history and it was due to his excellence that we even survived this long so charlie today the houston lands are valuable since with blood in our eyes we persevered for nearly three quarters of a century to hold it to do so we had to sell major parts of it until today all that is left is some lands at houston which now have good real estate potential which the 100 000 acres of guysuco rural lands cannot possibly hold so in the end holding on to it with blood in our eyes has finally returned a dividend the vieira family is very large my grandfather had 12 children those of us who advanced like my brothers in the fishing and boat building businesses were very successful men and had nothing to do with land or the dividends from houston and versailles since over the decades from the 60 s to now there was very little a fact it will be my pleasure to explain to the ccj in time most of us opted to enter other areas since the sugar growing was for us a disaster many live abroad some do not even own cars and have to work as teachers and in stores i made nothing in the sugar industry since i was paid like the other sugar estate managers and in 1992 i even abandoned it to develop my television business and that was when i finally made a few dollars and it is an obscenity that the situation can now be distorted as it is by people who do not understand it to say that this is a massively wealthy family yours faithfully tony vieira
politics next year will be of critical importance to the way in which financial markets perform ap photo richard drew comment equity investors have enjoyed an incredible ride over the past decade with the us s p500 index rallying over 300 since early 2009 and new zealand s nzx50 up by a similar amount this performance has been supported by a range of factors including record low interest rates massive liquidity strategies from the major central banks and government fiscal initiatives as we look into 2020 with many stock markets trading at or near to all time highs the questions many are asking are where we go from here and what are the most significant signposts to look out for in a global context the two economies that continue to have the most influence on world growth outcomes are the us and china over the past year both these countries have been challenged by deteriorating outcomes a major catalyst for this has been the sino us trade tensions which have created uncertainty across the global supply chain and weighed on corporate profits the recent reporting of third quarter gdp growth for the us as being the second slowest rate since early 2016 was testament to this with business fixed investment being particularly hard hit recent announcements though suggest that progress on this issue is being made recently it was announced that agreement had been reached on a phase one trade deal which should see the us not impose additional tariffs and china lift their purchase of agricultural products our expectation is that president trump needs to continue progress on trade before the elections in 2020 and beijing is also feeling anxious about the consequences of the dispute on their manufacturing industry even if a comprehensive deal is not signed any sense of further progress between the two parties should augur well for growth assets such as equities in response to the recent slowing growth dynamic central banks have again been implementing supportive strategies the us federal reserve for example has cut interest rates three times since july this year 0 75 per cent collectively this directional shift is important because it has occurred against a backdrop where the fed had stopped their quantitative easing programme in 2014 began raising rates in 2015 and initiated a reduction in their balance sheet in 2018 today though we see global money supply accelerating and yield curves are beginning to steepen what this means is that the interest rates on longer duration bonds are increasing which is historically a sign that the growth outlook is beginning to improve ultimately this is also positive for equities because corporate profits are leveraged to aggregate demand and with inflation remaining stubbornly low and we expect it to remain so over the medium term any disruption to the recovery thesis is likely to be met by a central bank response at the fed s most recent meeting chair jerome powell highlighted that the stance of policy was now appropriate to keep the economy growing moderately as the jobs market is strong and inflation is near the central bank s 2 per cent goal a recent fed senior loan officer s survey highlighted that a recovery in loan demand is occurring in the us which is encouraging because it is evidence that conventional monetary policy continues to be an effective tool politics next year will also be of critical importance to the way in which financial markets perform regardless of your view of president trump his impact on us and global stock prices since his victory in the 2016 presidential contest has been positive corporate america has benefited from a number of his policies the tax plan that he introduced in december 2017 was of particular importance included within this was a range of cuts to individual tax rates and a reduction in the corporate rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent as we look towards november 2020 the next us election there will be a great deal of attention on the impeachment process and the ultimate democratic nominee to contest the presidency although we will not have a clear indication of who this will be until march next year a number of the current front runners are looking very left wing and therefore perceived by the market to be business unfriendly us president donald trump poses for a photo with chinese president xi jinping during a meeting on the sidelines of the g 20 summit in osaka japan photo ap an example of this is that if a democrat was successful in their presidential bid and they reversed the 2018 corporate tax cut to once again being 35 per cent the estimated impact on s p500 earnings per share would be a hit of 7 per cent as is typically the case though there is often a drift towards the centre as the process moves forward and this is something that investors will closely monitor recent success for the democrats in kentucky s gubernatorial race as well as republican losses in the virginian state legislature have further clouded the picture in new zealand and australia the economic climate is still somewhat uncertain in australia there is however evidence that we have passed the trough with recent housing data in particular providing cause for encouragement after falling in general by 8 4 per cent between 2017 and june 2019 property prices as a whole are now 2 9 per cent off their recent lows and the best performing capital city over the three months to october this year is melbourne up 5 5 per cent in a recent statement rba governor philip lowe noted that the low level of interest rates recent tax cuts ongoing spending on infrastructure the upswing in housing prices in some markets and a brighter outlook for the resources sector should all support growth gdp is forecast to grow at 2 25 per cent next year rising to 3 0 per cent in 2021 unfortunately for new zealand our economic cycle appears to be lagging that of australia with business confidence in september reported at the lowest levels since 2009 encouragingly though more recent confidence trends have been positive with the december reading at the highest level recorded under the current government but even then a net 13 per cent of respondents expect worse times ahead at the rbnz s recent policy meeting rates were left unchanged but they did identify scope for additional monetary and fiscal stimulus if required similar to the us we are also entering into an election year in 2020 the implications for local equities are unlikely to be as potentially dramatic as they could be in the us but under our mmp electoral voting system and with a number of referendums to also be considered there will be plenty of noise for investors to work through federal reserve chair jerome powell listens to a question during a news conference after the federal open market committee meeting on dec 11 2019 photo ap turning to equity valuations international markets are not looking overly expensive despite the strength and duration of the current bull market the price to earnings multiple for global stocks as captured in the morgan stanley capital index is still broadly in line with historical averages but relative to bonds equities look very attractive the corporate earnings cycle in the us is also looking productive with third quarter results surprising on the upside this has resulted in earnings per share growth assumptions for the s p500 beginning to move higher in australia the opportunities for investors into 2020 are somewhat sector dependent the major banking stocks will continue to operate under the weight of change resulting from the royal commission and increased capital requirements whilst the mining sector looks well positioned to leverage off improving global macro fundamentals and commodity prices in new zealand we remain encouraged by the high quality of many of our listed businesses but we need to remain wary of the idiosyncratic risks which exist in our local market the recent review by rio tinto on the tiwai point aluminium smelter is a good example of this dynamic despite the nzx50 index looking expensive on traditional measures we continue to believe that our local exchange is well positioned to benefit from kiwisaver ongoing international investor demand many of those hunting our cash dividend yield of 3 5 per cent and our corporate earnings growth forecast to increase by over 7 per cent in summary the world continues to face a range of uncertainties but this is always the case stock markets provide a great window into the medium term prospects for economies and corporate potential and when all factors are considered today and looking into 2020 it appears that the environment remains positive we believe that growth assets such as equities will perform well going into next year but a close eye will need to be kept on events such as central bank policies and the us election mark brown is chief investment officer at devon funds
since the u s withdrawal from the joint cooperative plan of action jcpoa in may 2018 sanctions have caused considerable damage to the iranian economy in terms of crude oil iranian exports in may 2019 fell to a historic low of less than 500 000 barrels per day and possibly as few as 250 000 per day an enormous decrease from the 2 4 million per day that tehran was averaging under the terms of the jcpoa in early 2018 the inability to sell oil for dollars or euros has proven particularly detrimental to the country s currency reserves as reported in russia s независимая газета independent newspaper international sanctions have limited iran to only 10 of its aforementioned reserves to complicate matters further in october the international monetary fund imf noted that iran s economy by the end of the year would be 90 of its size just two years ago a number on par with failed states like libya and venezuela based upon such need for revenue tehran has raised gasoline prices by as much as 200 and imposed a strict rationing system following president hassan rouhani s announcement concerning reduction of oil subsidies mass protests erupted across the country the government crackdown on non violent protesters has been draconian in nature in addition to removing internet access as a means to reduce the possibility of coordinated actions iranian leadership may be responsible for more than one thousand civilian deaths in three weeks of protests moreover the regime has sought to cover up its violence by stealing corpses from the morgue and abducting injured demonstrators from hospitals in sum the u s has helped to push iran into what is arguably its greatest crisis since the revolution of 1979 in spite of such reality this does not imply that the west can afford to stand by and hope that economic woes and civilian resistance will inevitably lead to some form of lasting change in the country if the ultimate goal is to prevent tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and to end its funding of terrorist groups including hamas and hezbollah the united states and its allies must formulate an endgame based on geopolitical realities in my previous piece here i discuss the fatal flaws in the jcpoa along with the inability of the iranian government to moderate based on its core principles such evidence however does not mean that war with iran is imminent there are several means by which to isolate and potentially break the government of ayatollah ali khamenei and thus open the door to substantive change to begin the u s should work to strengthen ongoing sanctions in order to further inhibit tehran s ability to function one way in which to do so is through the sanctioning of intermediate and capital goods inputs in finished products or ingredients of finished goods which would prevent iran from being able to purchase these even if the regime comes up with the money as rouhani admitted in november the current situation is not normal and that without money we cannot run the affairs of the state by further tightening sanctions the u s will continue to destabilize the government and provide greater opportunity for opposition leaders seeking to overturn the leadership of the islamic republic in addition to such actions the u s and its allies must consider the need for renewed equilibrium among sunni majority gulf states including saudi arabia turkey egypt and jordan according to the shia beliefs of iran s ayatollahs the first step toward the creation of a genuinely legitimate world order would be the overthrow of the taghut i e the illegitimate political powers that now rule the entire islamic world as a result a nuclear iran would be unnerving to these states and prompt them to develop their own weapons of mass destruction all of which would exacerbate an already precarious regional order considering their greater emphasis on national interests rather than the overthrow of the existing order these sunni majority gulf states have a great incentive to maintain stability and thus to contain iran in the middle east lastly ending iran s decades long threat to regional and global security will require the u s to recognize the roles of russia and china in the balance of power unlike iran neither of these countries can truly be isolated due to their sheer size and military capabilities in terms of trade washington has far more to offer moscow and beijing than tehran while the u s and china have made significant strides in renegotiating a trade agreement the kremlin s relations with washington have continued to deteriorate given russia s ties to iran it is critical to pursue common interests with moscow in order to weaken its connection to tehran and to further stabilize the post cold war order if this happens the confinement of iran will have reached its apogee and will create the greatest possibility for principal change in the country in seeking to eliminate iran s nuclear potential and funding of terrorism abroad the u s and the regional great powers noted here cannot afford to remain silent in the hope that increased protests will accelerate the advent of democracy weakening and ultimately eradicating the threat posed by the iranian government will require coordinated efforts that place a premium on national interests and global security rather than appeals to nationalism and assessments of power such a framework will not and cannot abolish war but it may limit its impact if equilibrium rather than conquest is the ultimate goal
historical paradox freudo marxism historically has been identified as a tradition dedicated to or rigorously attempting to synthesize the works of karl marx and the psychoanalytic theories of sigmund freud the first attempts of synthesis were made during 1930 to 1945 in the wake of rise and fall of nazi flush in history it was also a process of retreat of marxist and proletarian movements we may identify this as multi disciplinary approach and a attempt to discover develop or resurrect a model or paradigm focused or directed at articulating problems in creating comprehensive integration of two apparently diametrically opposed theoretical modules of interpretations karl marx s interpretation of fetishism of commodities and sigmund freud s interpretation of dream fetish both strange and mystical one interpretation dedicated to uncover the creative essence of human production of things the material world appearing or manifesting as fetish and vice versa the other interpretation dedicated to unveil from the appearance of strange mystical conglomeration of imagery ideas and verbal utterances and penetrating to its essence and its reconstruction of the phenomena one apparently dealing with material world and other dealing with ideal world reconciliation of these two worlds was compelling necessity particularly from 1930 s this exercise was driven by rise and rise and ultimate fall of nazism in the wake of unimaginable human destruction and its perpetual upsurges in subsequent history this historical development threw up the retrograde nazi movement which attempted the conquer this world in face of marxist s assertion of inevitability of proletarian world revolution most vicious retrograde collective group ideology and thought processes driving the patriotic and ultra nationalist mass movements succeeded installing the nazi dictatorship in germany the freudo marxism which strongly emerged particularly in thirties was an attempt to reach into the depths of the phenomena to uncover the raging underground origins of retro gradation it was caused by unseen invisible power of aggressive archaic myths symbols and fantasies which formed the core of reactionary authoritarian and nazi style thought processes next attempt and movement to reconcile marx and freud and offer solution was resurrected amidst french and european student protests and agitations during 1968 short lived but eruption of intense revolt and which continued for next few years it radically impacted entire political cultural life including cinema music literature social sciences and art in entire europe it s presence significance and relevance is intensely felt today as much as never before in order to avoid repetition of history which led to second world war and unheard human destruction unfolding of project of freudo marxism freudo marxist theorizing progressed in 1920s in germany soviet union rest of europe and usa as well the soviet philosopher v yurinets and the freudian analyst siegfried bernfried who was the first major proponents of linking freudian discourse with marxist interpretations who had to migrate in view of nazi threat he along with other freudo marxists developed a project to unify and create a model to provide answers to fresh paradigm of history it was built on six pillars 1 psychoanalysis and historical materialism are both demystifying exercises on the subject of the inversions of reality and consciousness 2 discovering contents of consciousness reeling under repression from the manifest symptoms as freud discovered and facilitating rescue of the working classes subjected to oppressive relations of production which thus endlessly keep the working classes subjected to exploitation and alienation 3 human drives are the motor of history and likewise means of production 4 dialectics the struggle of opposites of drives and defense repression freud and between exploiters and exploited marx 5 to uncover the oedipus drama freud and unveil the modes of domination and exploitation in short contours of historical struggle towards achieving self control 6 to study the close relationships between unconscious pre conscious and consciousness or id ego superego freud and economic infrastructure and ideological super structure marx we must focus on major similarities of marxism and psychoanalysis as two scientific interpretative disciplines marx s capital announced the inevitable collapse of capitalism and liberation of the toiling laboring humanity from slavery and its expiry date interpretation of dreams on the other hand stood up as a rebellious discipline and becoming an anti establishment and anti semitic movement challenging the repression both psychic and cultural both foresee the new dawn and end of repression both developed as different discourses one on socio political and historical grounds the other on individualized psychological cultural terrain of bourgeoisie society both announced human liberation from enslavement and both had internationalist perspective in essence both interpretative exercises had coalescence of their aims but worked with different historical paradigms freudo marxism emerged as a provocative discipline with a mission to find out etiology of neurosis hysteria and destructive mental disorders and springing from authoritarian family structure pedagogical methods employed and modes of domination under capitalist exploitation the efforts were initiated and developed in due course by prominent and active adherents of psychoanalysis siegfried bernfeld 1926 erich fromm 1932 wilhelm reich 1934 and otto fenichel 1934 as well as paul federn annie reich reich s partner richard sterba and georg simmel all prominent freudo marxists were inspired by the bolshevik revolution its birth was historical necessity when workers movement experienced division between socialists and communist party on one hand and were subjected to fierce violence of the advancing nazis and anti semitic movement capitalist states of europe and usa began to carryout intensified repressions against working class organizations and associated political parties after 1929 economic crisis both disciplines had something in common with each other but was not easy to formulate in terms of goals aims and methodologies and techniques of interpretations marxism originated and had developed on the basis of different set of concepts thought patterns and postulates and subjects and hence had different methods of interpretations of phenomena in short both worked with different socio historical paradigms there plan was to transplant interpretative techniques of psychoanalysis on marxist foundations but the attempt proved abortive it was late the main reason of course was unexpected and unimaginable speed of nazi aggression supported and sponsored by big and monopoly capital both disciplines psychoanalytic movement led by psychoanalytic society in vienna and working class movement led by marxists and sympathized by freudo marxisists found themselves absolutely unaware resultant was smashing up of and the organizational strength and large number of left radical and psychoanalysts had to escape from germany and austria despotism exploitation repression and emancipation marx s paradigm fetish an archaic concept which is believed to be an object incarnated with supernatural power in particular a human made object that has power over others karl marx treatment and interpretation of this anthropological concept to comprehend magical qualities of commodities springing from inversion inherent in commodity production he terms it as fetishism of commodities it emerges as resultant from production process as more than spiritual sacred symbol or a spiritual idol it re emerges from archaic grounds from the shared belief of aboriginals in totem as an inanimate object worshipped for gratification of desires like sexual it s magical value pertains to transformation of use value into exchange value marx explains the mysterious character of the commodity form consists therefore simply in the fact that the commodity reflects the social characteristics of men s own labour as objective characteristics of the products of labour themselves as the socio natural properties of these things what is in fact a social relation between people between capitalists and exploited laborers instead assumes the fantastic form of a relation between things in capitalist society the real producers of commodities the proletariat remain largely invisible hidden and their social character is concealed by finished form of commodities and exchange and circulation of money these social relations appear as the relations between material objects unrevealed and enveloped and by gold and then by paper money and other forms marx s interpretation of capital fully succeeds in revealing the alienation of powers of collective labor and which transcends beyond control we find hegelian master slave dialectics very lucidly comprehended and narrated in capital volume one section iv production of relative surplus value here we find in his analysis of production of relative surplus value a very cogent co relationship discovered and interpreted by karl marx between despotism juggernaut of repression estrangement alienation inversion distortion and origins of fetishism too in nutshell it sums up marx s paradigm he says when analyzing the production of relative surplus value within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labor are brought about at the cost of the individual laborer all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over and exploitation of the producers they mutilate the laborer into a fragment of a man degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power they distort the conditions under which he works subject him during the labour process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness they transform his life time into working time and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the juggernaut of capital highlighted italics section iv chapter 25 page 449 capital volume 1 karl marx faced historically the most daunting and unparallel task and enterprise to interpret the world socio economic order of 19th century capitalism flourishing on foundations of new production and class relations the entire historically emerged social structure completely hidden by the veal of commodity circulation and fetishism breeding on the foundations of freedom for enslavement of labor power capital accumulation freedom to exchange here marx discovers the emergent historical role of the working class as the active historical agent possessing the potential to transform and revolutionize the human relations piercing through the all encompassing fetishism and striving to achieve collective self control the above paragraph enables us to picture represent or re construct the marx s paradigm which through critical enquiry penetrates to the grounds of modern capitalism which transforms the latent life giving substance of human creativity into manifest expression of accumulating and circulating capital the process which fully conceals it through its fetishised appearance karl marx in footsteps of wgf hegel comprehends it through dialectical process as under in terms of dialectic of force and energy for comparison purpose for marx labor is the life giving substance of this universe the creative force eros the integration of desires source of collective energy and despotic capital is the thanayos or death instinct capitalist competition leads to destruction wars world wars and annihilations labor is unifying power collectivity bringing together universe the men and women community races and nations the paradigm can articulate how commodity fetishism born within the womb of production is sustained and reproduced on ever expanding scale in the process of circulation of commodities which is the surface appearance of essence what sigmund freud discovered in analytical treatment was the eros or creative process sublimation of eros at work under the guidance of ego of individuals at work stimulated by desire anti semitism and epochal value of interpretation of dreams freud was no longer safe in vienna after the nazi occupation since the gestapo was not only targeting jews in general but psychoanalysts in particular in 1933 mobs of nazi sympathizers had burned freud s books chanting offering his writings to flames the critiques of freud have pointed out about his complicity during rise of nazism and occupation of austria few accused him of appeasement none of the account during this period lead to conclusion of appeasement yes it was crisis for international psychoanalysis also it psychoanalytic society was the only body which could have interpreted nazism as phenomena it cannot be ignored that psychoanalytic society was not a political organization and could not have fought in streets with nazis politically it is believed that it was freud s patient princess marie bonaparte napoleon s great granddaughter who rescued him by paying ransom to corrupt nazi s for his exit visa however nazis were aware of dangers psychoanalysis poses particularly his anti authoritarian scientific foundations and non patriotic orientation this was enough for them to persecute jews as well as most of its members of psychoanalytic society who did not fall in line freud s both sisters had to die in concentration camps the paradigms have historical moorings and change or transformation in historical situations with highlights of emergence of monopoly capitalism uprooting of communities formation of huge reserve armies of labor upswing of racialism nationalism galloping rise of anti semitism religious conflicts and geographical expansionist ambitions of modern capitalist states the complexities marked paradigm shift for marxists here we can re visit or identify the freudian paradigm as historically very complex cultural paradigm shortly we will be in a position to identify surprising parallels between their objectives where marx left freud began freud confronted with historical situation in which archaic past made its cultural appearance psychology defined as scientific study of human mind its behavior and the mental processes had its origins in ancient eastern and western civilizations of egypt greece china india etc but rise of capitalism brought along with it birth of various scientific disciplines sociology archeology anthropology and so also psychology as independent scientific discipline interfacing several other disciplines particularly from 1870 s in germany sigmund freud with joseph breuer made the land mark studies on hysteria this paved the way for science of psychoanalysis das capital volume one published in germany 1867 critique of political economy in every sense can be defined as laying the methodological foundations even for modern critical science of psychology which came into being as psychoanalysis here our interest is to demonstrate parallels between two critical sciences by comprehending the nature of freudian interpretation of dreams iod occupies special place in history of sciences and has become the corner stone in human achievements the great historian carl schorske in his article 1973 politics and patricide in freud s interpretation of dreams resurrected the epochal value of freud interpretation of dreams he calls freud un riddler of riddles who found the key to the human conditions in the story of oedipus carl schorske quotes freud s political phantasy after publication of interpretation of dreams it provided immense boost to public enthusiasm and resultant recognition of role of sexuality eros by his majesty the interpretation of dreams being confirmed by parliament and by his majesty by council of ministers recognition of and necessity of psychoanalytic therapy of hysteria by two third majority of parliament which he identifies as triumph over politics carl schorske was the first to explore the dual structure of the book first as a scientific treaty and second as a personal plot self analysis interpretation of dreams means assigning meaning to it means replacing it with series of mental acts having day time validity transforming something unintelligible to become intelligible beginning with scientific literature dealing with dreams it unfolds from exposition of differences of dream and waking life through chapter by sub chapter and reaches into depths of the unconscious here he avoids thousands of dreams of his patients and chooses one of his own dreams as specimen dream to avoid complexities and facilitate self observations he plunges into minutest details to fathom the hidden meanings of dream it is similar to how and why karl marx chooses simple commodity for interpretation the surface organization is governed by its function as scientific treaties which each chapter and section systematically expounds an aspect of dreams and their interpretations to this scientific structure freud explicitly subordinated the personal content of the book designating the dreams and memories that constitute it as only material by which i illustrated the rules of interpretation sub quote freud subjected dreams of few his patients to interpretations but most importantly his own dreams and which constitute an incomplete but autonomous subplot of his own personal history self analysis carl schorske compares this with saint augustine weaving his confessions into city of god or rousseau integrating his confessions as sublimated plot into origins of inequality the visible structure freud leads the readers upwards through exposition of dream work which is a process consisting of four parallel running but simultaneously interwoven integrating processes cum activities four successive activities condensation displacement means of representation and secondary revision symbolic representations and related processes to uncover the process of inversion and manifestation of fetishised distorted condensed expression of imagery the sub plot unfolds as a process of self analysis in which he encounters his own resistance and overcomes layers of repressions to weave together the memories through a process series of mental activities marked with backward and forward movements and reaches down into plethora of rebellious instincts to stir up the hail very appropriately his interpretation of dreams process marked with regression and progression is inscribed with poetic lines of virgil from his epic poetry aeneids if i cannot bend the higher powers i will stir up the infernal regions to picture and portray the efforts of the repressed instinctual instincts sigmund freud patricide and his counter political psychology the rise of anti semitism in 1895 austria and rise of new right affected freud in both ways his social upbringing and his professional life the more his social and personal life was acutely threatened 1897 the more flowered became his imaginations first it is interesting to note that number of his dreams to free himself from anti semitism acquired prominence the liberal culture of vienna suffered heavily with 1895 vienna victory of karl lueger with his racial prejudice with anti semite socio political agenda and who is credited with providing first model for adolf hitler s nazism while reading series of his dreams few involving his father we are led into most astonishing dream which he identifies as revolutionary fantasy or dream reference dream is that of count thun the autocrat nationalist of august 1898 august freud provides complete details of socio political background and the precipitating events he identifies count thun at westbanhhof platform he exhibited aristocratic pomp and arrogant behavior through series of scenes he found count thun at university student gathering offering contemptuous remarks freud suddenly rose in anger and provided befitting replies he identified himself in dream with adolf fischof the student leader of 1848 revolution and the politician after passing through various scenarios involving his fellow student victor adler leader of austrian social democracy freud digs out his buried wishes of political role leaving away his outburst freud escapes from the scene and lands on to railway station and in company of a man appearing to be blind freud offers him a male glass urinal helping the blind man to urinate here the man s attitude and the micturating penis appeared in plastic form iod p 232 freud identifies this old man as his dying father freud in dream takes vengeance against his father who had scolded freud the child who urinated in the bad and for tearing apart picture book the patricide was complete the strong man helped his week father to urinate the defiance and outburst against count thun finally culminates into patricide and in which he discovers the meaning carl schorske rightly states as father replaces the prime minister on the station platform patricide replaces politics here he connects victory over father as victory over politics freud reiterates his political theory politics is reducible to the primal conflict between father and son conquest of father who replaces the king count thun and patricide replaces the regicide but psychoanalysis overcomes history and politics is replaced by counter political psychology and works out the method of self control sigmund freud who himself was the part of process of racial victimization and hatred could readily grasp the thought distortions under the impact of censorship promulgated by repression he could conceptualize repression censorship and discover within dream interpretation the most protracted and difficult process of thought and imagination and uncovered in the womb of distortions the process which can be defined as making of fetishism the discovery of process of inversion through the interpretation of inversions in the night hours of human sleep and stirred up by drives within the unconscious thought processes greatest historical breakthrough in modern science after karl marx freudian paradigms interpretation of dreams we have seen in brief the socio historical context of european capitalism the milieu in which was rooted the career of young sigmund freud he made rapid progress in his medical profession by learning from his failure with cocaine therapy and switching over to therapy of traumatic hysteria and subsequently neurosis by joining hands with joseph breuer neurologist it was million dollar discovery that symptoms of hysteria was to recreate in the mind of the patient the event which caused it and inducing the patient to speak or talk out the feelings and images associated with it freud himself reiterated that the credit of birth of psychoanalysis goes to breuer if it is a merit to have brought psychoanalysis into being that merit is not mine when another viennese physician dr josef breuer first in 1880 2 made use of this procedure on a girl who was suffering from hysteria however freud s merit lies in developing elaborate technique of reconstructing repressed memories through interpretation of symptoms and imagery through patient s free associations this method of evoking the ideas which have been buried in to unconscious or even been concealed thoughts appearing as symptoms or distorted images and thoughts today we can ask whether or can psychoanalysis equip us in supplementing karl marx s paradigm and do both of them have compatibility of any kind two questions firstly whether it stands in congruence with marx s paradigm projecting human emancipation from repressive slavery and exploitation and secondly whether it has made beginning towards taking on socio political phenomena equivalent to nazism freud s dream interpretation is used as a paradigm exploring particularly after 1910 to go beyond interpretation of dreams which stands on the border line of individual and social psychology and traverse into socio psychology the partial realization of how social and economic forces which are rendered invisible during the interpretative process can be responsible for regression in group or mass psychology and hence the need to transcend freud faced with new situation with first world war began transcending his individualistic approach with group psychology and analysis of ego 1921 the ego and the id 1923 the loss of reality in neurosis and psychosis 1924 civilization and its discontent 1930 a comment on anti semitism 1938 psychoanalysis as a discipline born in 1880 s as part of psychology and medical discipline provides new rules of interpretation of mental sickness of humans under modern epoch and its socio historical conditions since it was born in the milieu marked by rampant rise of mental disorders and at the same time freud as individual had to confront anti semitism it became a science which equipped humans to understand one s self how and why human mind operates and articulates in specific ways in the process attempts to provide solutions by offering interpretative techniques methods and treatment which paves the way for a rigorous but conflicts ridden emancipation process of self discovery of progression amidst regression and achieve synthesis and self control secondly the material the discipline confronts is human behavior human utterances narrations speeches dreams disorders and how human mind operates how one s own mind and minds of others operate its road is progression involved in interpretive and liberative process simultaneously hence treatment of the patient works through layers upon layers of his repression hence freudian paradigm is focused on dream interpretation attempt to develop or present a paradigm a model which has both objective framework and subjective technique to synthesize a cohesive picture of complex problems confronting the community and offer way forward with a methodology to resolve the problem dream is remarkable product and is devoid of rationality or logical relationships hence freud discovers that one and one only of these logical relations is very highly favored by the mechanism of dream formation namely the relation of similarity consonance or approximation the relation of just as this relation of similarity is assisted by the tendency of the dream work towards condensation this method of representation by means of identification assists evasion of censorship due to resistance freud says the censorship imposed by resistance and represent ability operates simultaneously in a conducive and selective sense upon the mass of material present in the dream thoughts the reduction and the evasion of the resistance are simultaneously made possible by the state of sleep 572 dream as a whole is a distorted substitute for unconscious material distortion in dreams is the result of a censoring activity which is directed against unacceptable and rebellious unconscious wishful impulses freudian method and techniques of interpretation works against this irrationality and repression which smashes the logical relationships freud believed that the interpretation of dreams is the royal road to knowledge of the unconscious activities of the mind what freud investigated into was phenomena called dream or the manifest dream which is an expression driven by urges and drives freud s iod and the practical investigative and interactive treatment encompassed and comprised of a dialectical interpretative process it is marked by conflict of forces of transference and counter transference and through which freud reaches into the ground work immeasurable treasure of the thought processes imagery and symbols named latent dream he simultaneously comprehends the upward pre conscious and conscious articulation of processes activities in the form of manifest dream stimulated and driven by sexual and other drives during night hours with relaxation and mitigation of censorship and reduction of resistance mainly the sexual and destructive drives attempt to push forward for the expression of latent dream thoughts and images under the pressure of surviving resistance during sleep the phenomena called dream makes its appearance as attempt for satisfaction of these drives nazism return of the repressed and freud s paradigm shift it was only william reich in his writing the mass psychology he had started to do in 1931 squarely articulated the problem reich confronted reich was why do the working masses allow themselves to be mobilized into movements that are manifestly opposed to their economic interests this riddle he argued could not be solved economically there was no economic explanation for it the nazi ideology as termed by william reich when overflows on to the streets as material force is guided by distorted imagery his conception of ideology as a material force materielle gewalt the biopsychological grounding of ideology in the psychic structures molded by family by tradition and by a repressed and often brutalized sexuality rapid and vehemently aggressive rise of nazism marked a major challenge to german and european leftwing political parties working class trade union organization intellectuals significant number of them realized the need to understand interpret and effectively to counter nazi march and advance freudo marxists engaged themselves to comprehend nazi phenomena likened to dreams phantasies hysteric outbursts vengeance studded actions directed towards enemies of german nation all equal to psychic disorders the comprehension of the phenomena only through marxist paradigm appeared to be inadequate hence freudo marxist relentlessly worked for creation of new paradigm which we can identify as paradigm shift in freud repression is internalized incarnation crystallization of external force in psychic layers upon layers both in life of social individuals and inherited from ancestral archaic and cultural social pre history freud s dream interpretation has been the greatest discovery which developed suggestion method of stimulation for awakening of suppressed memories impaired memories freud says the dream work leads us into individual prehistory his childhood and on the other hand into socio cultural prehistory individual somehow recapitulates in abbreviated form the entire development of human prehistory to introductory lessons of psychoanalysis 1916 17 make very significant point which brings out difference between sigmund freud s and marx s concept of progression and regression in human cultural history freud s series of concepts repression regression and return of repressed are mile stone or breakthrough discoveries demarcating his methodology and techniques of scientific interpretation of dreams and symptom formations the force of instincts opens up week spots of substitutive satisfaction which comes to light as a symptom without the acquiescence of the ego but also without its understanding all the phenomena of the formation of symptoms may justly be described as the return of the repressed they include derivatives such as fantasies slips of tongue para praxisis also their distinguishing characteristic however is the far reaching distortion to which the returning material has been subjected as compared with the original moses and monotheism 1939 return from a higher to a lower stage of development then repression too can be subsumed under the concept of regression for it too can be described as a return to an earlier and deeper stage in the development of a psychical act however it was after the world war two number of american intellectuals worked on the foundations of freud s transition to paradigm no two return of the repressed and have dedicated themselves to understand and interpret nazism in terms of its origins as phenomena propaganda and culture and to reach to the roots of it for building the scientific models important of them have been harold lasswell leading american political scientist and communication theorist richard koenigsberg director of liabrary and social sciences and nicholas godrick clarke a specialist on nazi ideology all three of them have made extensive contributions on behavior and psychopathology lasswell spent most of 1927 28 year in berlin undergoing psychoanalysis at the hands of theodor reik a student of freud he can be credited as making systematic attempt to interpret unconscious oedipal and libidinal tendencies as powerful bulwark on rational object oriented behavior which can be mitigated by psychotherapy freud s return of the repressed provided new wings to freudians and marxists to comprehend the phenomena and the underlying forces meant that their struggle to discover the anomalies and deviations from the expected political thought processes moved into directions of mass psychology or group psychology his fresh paradigm suggest that it possesses the capacity to interpret its multiple meanings the network of thought processes and the hidden archaic the symbolism the signs which goes into its making of the phantasies post world war attempts towards political analysis of nazism richard koenigsberg on the other hand made brave attempts to understand dynamics of unconscious phantasies he has interpreted nazism as reaction and response to certain evolving historical situation which he terms as oedipal situation heis reference of enquiry was social structure dominated by monopoly and large capital engaged in intensified competition with others he asks under what circumstances and historical antecedent events could adolf hitler s unconscious phantasm and the shared phantasy of saving motherland could energize and stimulate the latent tendencies or the destructive desires springing from oedipus complex of large groups from the german social structure got activated and sought expression in reality of social action he sought for social historical explanation of this cultural political phenomenon richards further explains that mass murder of jews and anti semitic propaganda as tool designed to for realization of profound goals of nazism to unite the german people against common enemy to compel the men and women to project those unconscious personalized phantasies upon others on the stage of history he worked out how the individual psychology is translated into group psychology as per it richards brings to reader s notice that in mein kamf hitter discusses about the family life of the german proletariat hitler s attention is drawn to the quarrels between parents he observes that they often take the form of brutal attacks of the father against the mother thus like william reich richards succeeds in focusing upon the phenomenal form of resurrection of oedipal complex even amongst the ranks of proletariat like william reich he brings out the authoritarian family structure of german society and reasons why hitler could focus upon the sadistic treatment of the mother by the father the child s observation of drunken beatings states at the age of six the pitiable little boy suspects the existence of things which can inspire an adult with nothing but horror however he advances over reich s emphasis on authoritarian family structure and explore the origins and energization of patriotic phantasies their becoming psychically relevant what antecedent psychologically significant events increased the probability that these latent tendencies would be activated and seek expression in reality dynamics of unconscious phantasm he analyzed the nazi propaganda films by applying freud s dream interpretation to interpretation of political thought processes of nazis he focused on underground history concerned with the myths symbols and fantasies that bear on the development of reactionary authoritarian and nazi styles of thinking he focused on this unexamined topic of history because fantasies can achieve a causal status once they have been institutionalized in beliefs values and social groups goodrick clarke occult roots of nazism the dream work is a process consists of four parallel running but simultaneously interwoven integrating processes cum activities four successive activities condensation displacement representation and secondary revision to inverted condensed distorted in short fetishised manifestations lasswell is well known for his communication model and analysis of mass propaganda he has asserted that only when patriotism is vigorously supported by propaganda which reaches into depths of unconscious hate crimes are activated and atrocities can result he analyzed nazi propaganda films to identify mechanisms of inciting and perusing to garner support of german population for hitler and for war time atrocities during world war ii lasswell held the position of chief of the experimental division for the study of war time communications at the library of congress one of his book psychopathology and politics became well known and popular lasswell s work was important in the post world war ii development of studies on behavioralism nazism was an explicit articulation or outbreak of mass hysteria well rooted in such oedipus fantasies fundamentally as return of the repressed the repressed returns on the surface with force and energy it represented by symbols and signs from prehistory and manifested as pathological phenomena compatibility of freudian and marxist paradigms in the wake of rise of freudo marxism also developed its opponents within the ranks of marxists rather from the stalinist loyalists and sympathizers numbers of marxists contemporaries to freud have been his opponents as well for illustration george lukacs and j d bernel have identified freud as victim of individualistic philosophies and who has attempted to push the human history in retrograde into past bernel states freudian interaction seeks to set up the individual and the bourgeois individual at that as the centre and measure of all things george lukacs also reiterates that freudian method has a bias towards starting out from the human being artificially insulated isolated through capitalist society and its production system their criticism remained confined to individualistic moorings of psychoanalysis and never pips into freud s methodology if we understand that psychoanalysis was born within the socio historical melio marked with rampant inflation of anti semitism freud s second paradigm which evolved after 1910 stands as a proof that freud understood the need to comprehend civilization and its discontent and transcend the individualistic limitations marxist opponents of freud like george lukacs and others in 1930 s and forties could have noticed that despite freud s individualistic philosophical moorings marxists stand to enrich theory from freudian endeavors freud s concepts of repression resistance and regressions could have helped them to in freud s iod the dream work represents the metamorphosis of latent content of dream into manifest content his chapter means of representation is specifically dedicated to discuss the process of inversion freud illustrates up down dream as prototype of it he stresses that inversion or transformation into the opposite is one of the most favored and most versatile methods of representation which the dream work has at its disposal this chapter can provide wings to marxists in taking forward marx s methodology lasswell and other post war historians like carl schorske and other intellectuals with freudian influence have brought us closer to understand freudian paradigms and confront them with marx s paradigm to understand surprising compatibility underlying dialectics of rebellion and repression and their differences as well also to understand psychoanalytic interpretations of textual verbal and all other forms of manifest thought processes including the political thoughts and to reach down into core of the latent thought processes and the distortions condensations and so on and to reconstruct it psychoanalysis has potentials to provide integrated support to marxist theory and practice because psychoanalysis is by birth anti semantic interpretative and supportive of emancipatory process its core methodology and techniques is founded within master slave dialectic it possesses the potentials to help marxism and working class leadership to understand integrities involved in class aspirations towards social and self control in every sense marx s and freudian endeavors have common and unified aim of bringing the irrational instinctual forces under self control and emancipation revolutionary kernel of freudian discoveries lies in entire gamut related to dialectical methodology of enquiry treatment and self analysis the process of psychoanalytic cure pictures or portrays the efforts of the slave under the guidance of therapist and the stages through which the struggle passes against the resistance censorship repression or more rightly against the reification reading freud s awe inspiring interactive case studies with patients their awakening and rising again falling back into oblivion to wake up again as result of positive transference we are reminded of the anxieties experienced while reading leon trotsky s history of the russian revolution or john read s ten days that shook the world its ups and downs turns of events regression and progression in the midst of historical struggle against czarist state repression in 1905 or 1917 of russian revolution and finally concluding with collective political triumph of the enslaved proletarian masses freud s interpretation of revolutionary dream shows way forward against the criticism of individuation and freud as individualist hence criticism to identify freud as individualistic philosopher by george lukach is certainly one sided and his criticism are peripheral in content every freudian successful treatment transcends individuation and are creative articulations psychoanalysis deals with individuals but demonstrates its potential to transcend its own founding limitations freud s transition from psychology to sociology from totem and taboo and explicit turn group psychology and the analysis of ego 1921 demonstrates his forays into social freudian theory can impact marx s vision in field of concepts such as repression return of repressed transference the most tedious relationship between latent and manifest expressions in social political cultural and historical areas and can add immense value to marxist praxis freudo marxist beginning with reich have attempted to bridge the apparently yawning gap between marxist socio historical methodology and freudian individualism it is not easy to do so and needs immeasurable efforts to do so however the confrontation of paradigms indicate how close their methodologies of interpretation and have parallel techniques are both approach the object of interpretation from the manifest appearance and traverse towards the essence and return to appearance in the footsteps of w g f hegel karl marx brings out the inevitability of social control on the other hand sigmund freud shows the way forward toward self control and emancipation both begin their interpretations from appearance and encounter repression and resistance to reach into the realms of essence a method which can be defined as working through hence though the freudian and marx s paradigms are founded on different socio historical terrains they do not stand in conflict with each other the freudian model portrays the function and role of positive transference lends it the directions to free from censorship and helps the subject to attempt to struggle to attain the goal of emancipation like the marx s model freudian model or paradigm is an upward process which unveils fetishistic regressive distortions displacements which are equivalents of inversion to build bridges between marx s and freudian paradigm

editor s note cgtn s first voice goes beyond the headlines to dissect examine and analyze hot off the press issues and break down breaking news into simple bits the daily column offers a chinese perspective on global current events to help you shape your views on matters that shape your life while financial support for favored firms or industries is common in many countries the wall street journal claims that help from the chinese state is among the factors stoking questions about huawei s relationship with beijing the report which provides a list of subsidies that huawei has received from the state documented a rosy relationship between the company and government the implicit conclusion is that huawei s success has been all about government subsidies and it almost seems like huawei is a state owned company it is obvious that the report is based on the free market value that sees government subsidies and industrial policies as essentially unfair practices in an ideal world the market may be the king and an even playing field for competition may be the order of the day but as history shows industrial policy is not only common it is one of the secrets of how many developed countries have accumulated their wealth virtually all wealthy countries today have used industrial policy to protect their infant industries in the early stages of development the first us treasury secretary alexander hamilton s suggestion to congress placed industrial development policy at the heart of his recommended economic plan britain s dominance of wool manufacturing in the 1860s was also achieved by subsidies which was considered high tech at that time the above examples may seem too ancient but industrial policies are as relevant today as they were then and america itself has already reaped the rewards in the 1950s and 60s the us government s support of space and military industry built the technological foundation for the success of silicon valley which contributed to america s technological dominance many previous us governments have proposed long term plans to help develop emerging industries the information highway which was part of a 30 billion us dollar infrastructure package offered in president clinton s economic program in the 1990s was a classic example from 1960 to 1973 japan s economy was growing at an impressive average rate of 11 6 percent during this period japan was also actively pushing industrial policies to transform its economic structure tax exemption and state subsidies were used to support its heavy industry and car manufacturing there are exceptions of course but it is almost an open secret that industrial policies help protect infant and emerging industries the world investment report 2018 has already pointed out that in recent years over 100 countries have adopted industrial development strategies to meet the challenges of the new industrial revolution as china s high tech market is still moving upward upgrading its transformation will inevitably need assistance from the state it is ironic that developed countries like the us would deny the influence of industrial policy in its economic success and instead lecture developing countries to do as it says but not as it did america s hypocrisy points to the real intention of its criticism of china s industrial policy it would hate to see china s rise in the high tech industry the media and us politicians are working closely to suppress china s development it was fine when huawei was just trading and producing network switches but when it started to lead in the race to 5g huawei become a national security threat and industrial policy is the black hand even today to maintain its advantage in the high tech field america is making long term industrial plans to ensure its implementation through legislation the revitalize american manufacturing and innovation act of 2014 and the national quantum initiative act are all national efforts to lead america to make future technological breakthroughs thus the premise of the war the us launched to combat industrial policy under the free market flag is untenable this is not to say that industrial policies are all legitimate some of them do require careful scrutiny the question is since when has america become the judge of other countries economic policies as one recalls there is only one final judge that handles trade disputes across countries the world trade organization but from the looks of it the us is not preparing to engage in any multilateral dialogue and the war is to go on
bill clinton aide james carville once famously remarked that when it came to winning elections it s the economy stupid this dictum has led many observers to surmise that the currently strong u s economy makes president trump a shoo in for re election in 2020 but what these observers overlook is that between now and november 2020 there can be many an economic slip between cup and lip this would seem to be especially the case at a time when the imf estimates that 90 percent of the world s economies are now already experiencing slowdowns this was the lesson that john mccain r ariz painfully learned as the u s and global economies took a nosedive on the eve of the november 2008 presidential election after having started the year on a seemingly sound footing to be sure if the election were held today the strong u s economy would make trump a formidable candidate for reelection u s unemployment is now at a fifty year low the economy is growing at a satisfactory rate wages are rising and the u s stock market is beating record levels on an almost daily basis while these achievements might have been made at the cost of incurring a large budget deficit and a ballooning public debt that might have mortgaged our economic future such matters all too likely will be of little concern to the electorate unfortunately for trump it is not today s u s economy that is going to be the determining factor in the 2020 election rather it is how the u s economy and financial markets perform in the months immediately running up to november 2020 in this context it would seem that there are all too many reasons to think that in six months time the u s economy could be looking decidedly less rosy than it does today today all too reminiscent of the start of 2008 a dark cloud hangs over the u s and global economies that cloud is a global credit and asset price bubble of epic proportions that has been spawned by a decade of ultra easy money by the world s main central banks one indication of this bubble is the fact that global debt to gdp levels today are significantly higher than they were at the start of 2008 other indications are that u s and global equity valuations appear to be stretched housing bubbles have re appeared in a number of important economies and an alarming amount of credit has been extended to non creditworthy borrowers around the globe at historically low interest rates nobody can know when the global credit and asset market bubble will burst or what event will cause it to burst but with the abrupt change in the global economy over the past year it would be rash to dismiss totally out of hand the possibility that the global credit bubble could burst well before the november election this especially seems to be the case at a time when the chinese economy shows clear signs of losing momentum the german italian and u k economies all appear to be on the cusp of recessions and the indian economic growth rate has halved in the context of increased domestic political strife it also seems to be the case at a time when president trump has a fragile truce in his trade war with china and at a time when he is threatening to impose additional import tariffs on an already weak european economy further heightening the risk that the global credit bubble might burst before november 2020 is a deteriorating global political landscape it is not only the fact that geopolitical risks in north korea and iran have increased or that the middle east is once again in turmoil it is rather that social protests seem to be gaining momentum in countries as disparate as chile colombia france hong kong india iran and venezuela worse yet there is every indication that this social unrest is spreading from one country to another past experience including that in 2008 should inform us that when credit and asset price bubbles burst the economic and financial market fallout could be disruptively large the 2008 experience should also remind us as to how interconnected the world s economic and financial system has become this has to raise the possibility that much in the same way as in 2008 the lehman bankruptcy spilled over from the united states to the rest of the global economy a systemic crisis abroad in 2020 could very well spill back to our shores trump could very well be lucky in 2020 and have the global credit bubble burst after his reelection but this is far from a certainty it would seem to be equally possible that this time next year we will look back and ask ourselves how we could have missed so many early economic warning signs about real trouble ahead in the global economy these signs might include the recent sovereign debt default in argentina the rising private credit defaults in china and turkey the we work financial fiasco and the abrupt economic slowdown in china and germany the world s second and third largest economies respectively desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american

yellow vest protests a movement initially against high fuel prices that ballooned into a wider revolt against president emmanuel macron s pro market policies and governing style named after the high visibility jackets worn by the protesters the yellow vest movement posed a great challenge to macron who has since offered billions of euros in state aid and tax breaks and scrapped a planned fuel tax hike twelve months after on december 5 unions started their strike against macron s radical pension reform that seeks to unify 42 existing pension plans into a single points based pension scheme the government has since offered concessions to unions but failed to appease them the ongoing strike has crippled public transport in paris and other cities and affected businesses still reeling from the impact of the yellow vest movement catalonia in october the jailing of 9 catalan separatist leaders for a failed 2017 independence bid sparked days of mass protests in barcelona and other catalan cities on october 26 over 350 000 demonstrators held a peaceful march in central barcelona in protest of the decision of spain s supreme court sentenced the separatist leaders to heavy jail terms a separate demonstration turned violent later that day the unrest in catalonia was one of the key issues that affected spain s general election in november global climate strike inspired by greta

venezuela s opposition chief juan guaido declared himself interim president escalating a long running political and economic crisis he is recognized by more than 50 countries including the united states but the army backs president nicolas maduro and to this day he remains in his post for a long time he didn t distinguish himself as an outspoken critic of maduro but when he proclaimed himself president in january guaido suddenly emerged as the socialist leader s main opponent a key challenge now is to continue to inspire a wilting opposition when he burst into the scene in january the 36

streets of managua to mark the first anniversary of a deadly uprising argentina opponents of then argentinian president mauricio macri organized a 24 hour strike in may to protest the government s inability to reduce inflation that reached 55 over the past year the strike in argentina paralyzed public transport while all flights to and from the country s airports were canceled banks schools and universities were closed in december center leftist alberto fernandez was sworn in as the new president egypt the major protest action in egypt for 2019 took place in september when thousands of people in a number of cities called on president abdel fattah al sisi to step down in april parliament approved changes to the constitution that extended sisi s rule from 4 years to 6 and allowed him to run for reelection in 2024 this means sisi could possibly remain as president till 2030 police dispersed the crowds using live and rubber bullets and tear gas more than 4 000 arbitrary arrests were made including prominent human rights lawyer mahienour el massry iraq a series of anti government protests in iraq began in october and are ongoing despite street closures internet blockages and violence the protests are an attempt to weed out the political class and lessen sectarian divisions in the country protesters also want to end the political system in place since the ouster of saddam hussein there have been at least 400 deaths from the protests according to estimates the resignation of iraqi prime minister adel abdel mahdi in november did not dampen the protests iran what began as outrage against an oil price increase turned into protests against the iranian government and its supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei the protests began on november 15 hours after it was announced that the price of gasoline would be raised by 50 for the first 60 liters and by 300 for anything above that each month by november 16 the internet had been blocked the government said it would unblock connectivity once it could be sure the internet will not be abused to cause violent demonstrations connections started coming back online around november 21 at least 208 people reportedly died in the protests according to amnesty international though there are reports that bodies might have been stolen from morgues and injured people arrested to lower the profile or scale of the crackdown following the protests khamenei said those killed in the nationwide unrest who had no role in fomenting it should be treated as martyrs and their families compensated lebanon in lebanon there were protests seeking to remove the political class with accusations of systematic corruption across parties prior to the main protests there were demonstrations in september over the state of the deteriorating economy what triggered the protests by october 17 were planned taxes on gasoline tobacco and usage of whatsapp calls and other messaging services read whatsapp as a tool for fear and intimidation in lebanon s protests this culminated in the resignation of prime minister saad hariri s government though protests continued as demonstrators sought to get rid of the entire political class including the president michel aoun and speaker of parliament nabih berri and form a new government with competent specialists south africa with one of the highest rates of protests in the world south africa is sometimes referred to as the protest capital of the world south africa s most prominent protest this year was the service delivery protests held from april to may it was anchored on the lack of delivery of municipal services or the basic services which the government taxes citizens for such as roads sanitation water services and others a month before its general election in may political parties fired accusations at one another over the cause of the protest actions the african national congress anc asserted the democratic alliance da did not effectively deliver services to communities but the da said anc governance in the years before the elections led to the issues the anc won the elections though at a lower vote share than in previous elections hong kong the months long protests in hong kong started in april when tens of thousands of people marched peacefully against a bill that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to mainland china the protests that followed remained peaceful even during the huge protest on june 9 where a crowd of at least 150 000 marched against the proposal days later on june 12 the protests turned violent as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters who tried to storm parliament and block roads hong kong s embattled leader carrie lam postponed the extradition bill on june 15 but there was no let up in the demonstrations on july 1 the anniversary of hong kong s return to china hundreds of protesters stormed parliament ransacking the building and daubing its walls with graffiti aside from the street protests the pro democracy movement also brought its advocacy to different parts of the city malls train stations airports and campuses after 3 months of unrest lam s government scrapped the extradition bill on september 4 but prominent activist joshua wong called the move too little too late by then protesters were already demanding that hong kongers are allowed to directly elect their leaders and also an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality the months that followed saw the hong kong government invoking emergency powers to ban protesters face masks the people of hong kong being nominated for the 2020 nobel peace prize the united states senate adopting legislation supporting human rights and democracy in hong kong and people dying in protest linked incidents there

the prize has gone to three people studying how the poor can derive more benefit from existing development practices it sees no reason to question the existing market and growth driven economy and its derivative development theory it doesn t threaten the massively unjust and environmentally destructive global systems that keep billions in poverty the 720 000 pound prize has been awarded for studies carried out in developing countries over several decades applying randomised trials to determine the effects of interventions like school meals small monetary incentives for school attendance and work motivation nobel media 2019 especially noteworthy are devices for reducing purchasing of temptation goods conceivably also of use in rich countries these are identified as nudges only likely to make small differences in the right direction but claimed to be capable of adding to significant effects in large populations much if not all of this work would seem to be unambiguously worthwhile such as exploring how to improve vaccination rates but there are disturbing criticisms which go far beyond these studies to indict the tunnel vision and ideological nature of conventional economic theory and practice the focus in these studies is on getting individuals to perform better within the system the faulty individual is the problem as mader et al 2019 say the idea is to help poor people overcome supposedly irrational risk aversion in order to be more entrepreneurial or more time consistent and save for a rainy day even leaving the issue of fault aside this focus on individualism is the first problem like micro finance which helps the budding entrepreneur to invest and get ahead it is about helping the most able and energetic to succeed presumably on the assumption that if enough do so a good society will eventually result this is to ignore the possibility that the problems are due to faulty social structures rather than faulty individuals and the possibility that the best solutions would involve collective effort to establish radically alternative structures and systems thus the second major problem is that the approach takes conventional development theory and practice for granted it reveals a complete absence of interest in the possibility that these are technically and morally unacceptable and a legitimization of structures and practices which have condemned billions of people to suffer extreme poverty for decades and which continue to do so mader et al reject the behaviourist approach to the study of poverty and argue that the concern should be the political social and cultural questions about what causes poverty and inequality kvangraven 2019 recognizes that poverty alleviation is not development and that while small interventions might generate positive results at the micro level they do little to challenge the systems that produce the problems in other words this kind of focus has powerful ideological significance it distracts attention from the way economic orthodoxy takes it for granted that there can be no conceivable alternative to the current approach to development it is necessary here to briefly outline a critique of the dominant perspective few if any areas of economics are as open to criticism as are conventional development theory and practice the source of the problem lies in the taken for granted conception of what constitutes development there could be many perspectives on what the goals of development might be and what the means to them might be however almost all contemporary discussion centres only on one conception its essential assumptions and principles are the goal or at least the one that enables the achievement of all others is increasing the amount of producing and consuming going on i e growing the gdp poor countries must therefore plunge into the global market economy they must find something to try to sell if only cheap labour competing against all other poor countries only if something can be sold can the money be earned to import what is needed it is not possible to develop without capital people who have capital must be attracted to invest it in setting up farms factories fishing fleets and mines to produce exports these ventures will produce whatever the investors think will maximize their profits within the global market economy foreign investment never goes into producing to meet urgent local needs foreign investors will not come in unless there are ports power stations roads etc so the government must go into debt to build these before long the loan repayments will probably have become impossible but the friendly people at the imf and world bank will come to the rescue with more loans and structural adjustment packages which will require the country to gear its development more closely to the interests of the foreign investors i e de regulate devalue sell off industries cheaply to foreign corporations enable sale of land from peasants to corporations cut subsidies and welfare so loan repayments can be made the result is that the country will develop a lot of factories and plantations but none of them are likely to be producing anything the poor majority want or can afford the country s resources will mostly be flowing into the production of goods to sell in rich world supermarkets if the country does not have any logs left to export and can t attract foreign corporations in then unfortunately it can t have any development it is imperative that market forces be allowed to determine the country s fate business turnover and gcp will be maximised if there is minimal regulation subsidies protection or other interference with market forces so free corporations to invest in what makes most money for them ignore the fact that markets will always deliver scarce resources to the rich because the rich can always pay more for them and will always develop industries that produce what the rich want to buy all this is cast as not just legitimate it is inevitable it s just the way the market system works people with capital to invest are not going to come in and produce beans for hungry peasants making negligible profits when they can invest in soy exports and make good profits you can t expect high royalties on your copper exports when other countries are willing to accept lower royalties because they are desperate to pay off their debt the impoverished masses are told to accept these processes because they will benefit via trickle down they are not told that in fact very little ever trickles down or that it is not the case that the mechanism is lifting large numbers out of poverty except in china which has taken the exporting capacities other countries once had and thus raised unemployment rates there see hickel 2017 nor are they told that global resource limits rule out any possibility of trickle down ever raising billions of impoverished people to tolerable living standards let alone to rich world levels after seventy years of this approach to development about four billion people are very poor around 800 million are hungry and more lack clean water thousands of children die avoidably every day and half the world s wealth has now been accumulated in the hands of less than 20 people leahy s work 2009 2019 is unusual in pointing out the futility of mainstream african development efforts to get impoverished farmers to succeed in the intensely competitive global free market food export arena let s not draw attention to the fact that us agribusiness is subsidized 20 billion every year this conventional approach is a delight to the world s rich development cannot take place unless the owners of capital get opportunities to invest in profitable ventures and third world productive capacity goes into stocking rich world supermarkets and not into producing what the people urgently need even worse it prevents them from using the resources around them the soils forests rainfall and their own labour and traditional skills to produce for themselves basic goods they need development theory rules this out there is no alternative indeed no alternative is conceivable this is just as well imagine how disruptive it would be if third world people worked out how to develop satisfactorily without having anything to do with investors banks debt export industries or the imf but the risk is slight as all the experts and advisers have studied conventional economics the economics text books do not point out that conventional economics is only one of many possible kinds of economics a kind narrowly focused not on increasing religious observance for instance but simply on maximizing production for sale in markets by contrast the development goal of bhutan is to maximize the gross national happiness thus conventional development economics is in fact only about capitalist development it is an approach which allows development to be driven by the investment of capital to maximize profits it produces a great deal of development but it is almost entirely only development in the interests of the rich it can in other worlds be seen as a thinly disguised form of plunder economics courses tend not to draw attention to this interpretation of how development works what then might be the goals of a more acceptable conception of development one suggestion might be enabling all to enjoy a high quality of life in ecologically sustainable ways consider the factors most likely to enable this would not these include having good health good food sufficient shelter and clothing having a good family and friends in a supportive community satisfying and appreciated work freedom from violence insecurity stress anxiety and depression knowing others care about you knowing you will be secure in old age a relaxed pace a pleasant and sustainable environment a sense of having collective control over one s society living in a society one can be proud of one that all the world s people could share except perhaps for the first of these factors monetary wealth is irrelevant let alone a prerequisite some of the world s poorest people including those living in rich world eco villages enjoy them all it is very easy to design settlements and economies which would guarantee these conditions here is a brief indication of the simpler way vision assist people to build highly self sufficient and cooperative local village regional economies which devote local resources to meeting as many of their needs a possible in framing goals and policies totally ignore monetary values volumes of investment business turnover or gdp aim at providing simple but sufficient food housing clothing etc via community development committees organizing available land labour and skills to meet as many urgent needs as possible focus first on intensive development of alternative sustainable agriculture this might involve many existing small private farms and firms but would prioritise building community collective capacities through non profit co operatives commons community supported agriculture working bees edible landscapes tree crops free food sources etc only export surpluses facilitate craft garden artisan hand tool and traditional means of producing as these are typically quite adequate but use modern technologies where sensible eliminate unemployment organize for all to have a productive role there are many things that need doing this is best done by setting up village co operatives to produce necessities e g fish or poultry if necessary create village currencies to enable trade between people who have no national currency simply by recording credits and debts created by mutually beneficial exchange establish village self government via participatory town assemblies and committees avoid top down authoritarian or expert led procedures the empowerment and morale of all as equal citizens is crucial for effective village functioning avoid or at least minimise involvement of official government agencies except in so far as they are willing to support village led development these activities can flourish without any need to first eliminate the normal market driven economy they involve the establishment of a new needs driven economy along side the old profit driven economy in time it is likely that the role for the latter will become less relevant the most important committees organize cultural affairs education monitoring especially of community morale and perceived quality of life festivals celebrations and the provision of local leisure and holiday activities all at negligible dollar or resource costs recognise that the quality of life must be redefined in terms of enjoying community arts and crafts a relaxed pace leisure time freedom from stress depression unemployment and insecurity contributing to an admirable society as distinct from accumulating individual or national monetary wealth one s wealth of life experience would derive from how well one s village was working these local economies will need some but very few basic inputs from the wider regional and national economies such as chicken wire plastic irrigation pipe cement and hand tools providing these would require governments to allocate very few national resources governments would need to widely distribute the few mostly light industries producing these items so that each village could make a contribution the national supply of some of these enabling it to pay for its imports of those it required the miniscule resources needed would leave national governments quite capable of funding the socially crucial systems villages need but can t provide for themselves such as medical services especially when this alternative approach would enable them redirect the wealth flows presently going out to foreign investors and shoppers most of these elements are characteristic of the 3 000 eco villages that now exist the remaking settlements study trainer 2019 explains how an outer sydney suburb redesigned along these lines might cut per capita dollar and resource costs by 90 while providing most of its food and other needs lockyer 2019 found that the dancing rabbit eco village in missouri had per capita resource use rates around 5 to 10 of us national averages sustainability cannot be achieved unless reductions of this order are achieved and they can only be achieved where settlement geographies and economies are small in scale integrated and highly collectivist cooperative although there could also be many privately owned small farms firms and co ops for example these conditions enable kitchen scraps to go straight to the poultry and their manures to go straight to gardens at no cost in energy transport bureaucracy etc the study of egg supply by trainer malik and lenzen 2019 found that such a supply path would have dollar and energy costs around 0 5 2 of the typical supermarket path the senegalese government is working to establish 1 400 eco villages st onge 2015 leahy 2009 2019 documents the remarkable success of the kind of alternative village self sufficiency advocated above concerned to enable african villagers to use the resources around them to cooperatively meet as many of their basic needs as possible evidently no relevance or value is seen in any of this by the nobel prize winners or the judges or almost anybody else within the economics profession industry to them this would be obvious because this alternative fails to recognise that economics in general and development in particular can only be about earning more money investing capital increasing production for sale and raising the gdp hence the remarkable power that the study of economics has on the mind these people profess to want to remedy poverty but they can see no reason to study the glaringly obvious glaringly unjust massive structures that determine and legitimize the flow of third world wealth into the pockets of the rich while keeping billions impoverished most disturbing is not that three high prestige researchers think the best strategy is not to question that system while working out how to help prod a few more people to get more of the scarce credentials and jobs it offers it is the mentality of the economics establishment which has led it to regard this work as the most valuable contribution to poverty relief they could find for a more detailed critique of conventional development and of the alternative to it see third world development hickel j 2017 the divide a

new home sales for november were reported at 719 000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis saar sales for the previous three months were revised down combined sales were above 700 thousand saar for four consecutive months and in five of the last six months the best six month stretch since 2007 annual sales in 2019 will be the best year for new home sales since 2007 earlier new home sales at 719 000 annual rate in november click on graph for larger image this graph shows new home sales for 2018 and 2019 by month seasonally adjusted annual rate sales in november were up 16 9 year over year compared to november 2018 year to date through november sales are up 9 8 compared to the same period in 2018 the comparison for december is easy so sales will likely be up double digits in 2019 compared to 2018 a solid year for new home sales and here is another update to the distressing gap graph that i first started posting a number of years ago to show the emerging gap caused by distressed sales the distressing gap graph shows existing home sales left axis and new home sales right axis through november 2019 this graph starts in 1994 but the relationship had been fairly steady back to the 60s following the housing bubble and bust the distressing gap appeared mostly because of distressed sales even though distressed sales are down significantly following the bust new home builders focused on more expensive homes so the gap closed slowly now the gap is mostly closed and i expect it to close a little more however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes another way to look at this is a ratio of existing to new home sales this ratio was fairly stable from 1994 through 2006 and then the flood of distressed sales kept the number of existing home sales elevated and depressed new home sales note this ratio was fairly stable back to the early 70s but i only have annual data for the earlier years in general the ratio has been trending down since the housing bust and is getting close to the historical ratio and i expect this ratio will trend down a little more note existing home sales are counted when transactions are closed and new home sales are counted when contracts are signed so the timing of sales is different
in an earlier article fair org 12 18 19 regarding the washington post s afghanistan papers 12 9 19 i discussed how the post s exposé also exposed the post as one of the primary vehicles us officials use to spread their lies and why it s impossible for corporate media outlets like the post to raise more substantive questions about the deceptive nature of us foreign policy but those aren t the only significant takeaways the afghanistan papers should also be considered an excellent case study of contemporary colonial propaganda and yet another example of corporate media criticizing us wars without opposing us imperialism edward herman and noam chomsky s famous analysis of media coverage of the vietnam war in manufacturing consent found that questions of the invasion s tactics and costs to the us dominated the debate because the media absorbed the framework of government propaganda regarding the necessity of military intervention the righteousness of the american cause and the us s nobility of intent decades later herman and chomsky s propaganda model of corporate media is still a useful tool in understanding the post s afghanistan papers the post advanced the centuries old colonial narrative of the empire s good intentions gone awry when it argued that the us inadvertently built a corrupt dysfunctional afghan government and that this illustrated that even some of the most well intentioned projects could boomerang in fact the post dedicated a whole section of the afghanistan papers to propagating this standard colonial narrative called stranded without a strategy which argued at length us and allied officials admitted they veered off in directions that had little to do with al qaeda or 9 11 by expanding the original mission they said they adopted fatally flawed warfighting strategies based on misguided assumptions about a country they did not understand related story news analysis war peace ending the afghan war won t end the killing the u s has an obligation to clear explosive hazards in afghanistan a large portion of which are of u s origin truthout diplomats and military commanders acknowledged they struggled to answer simple questions who is the enemy whom can we count on as allies how will we know when we have won their strategies differed but bush and obama both committed early blunders that they never recovered from according to the interviews the post is so eager to push this colonial narrative of noble incompetence that a later report 12 11 19 on key takeaways from the afghanistan papers claimed that us officials failed to align policy solutions with the challenges they confronted having strategic drift in place of coherent us policy for afghanistan as noted earlier one method of discerning whether us officials are being dishonest not incompetent is to check whether the pretexts for invading and occupying another country are constantly changing but the imperial utility of a cost benefit or tactical critique of us wars is the implication that immoral and illegal invasions like the afghanistan war are justifiable if the us can achieve its goals and it enables future invasions provided us wars are better fought next time it s an intentionally nebulous criterion since there are always tactical and cost benefit questions to be raised for any military endeavor which is why this kind of critique can enable perpetual interventions in the service of us imperialism indeed the post actually admits this when it mentioned that the afghanistan inspector general s secretive lessons learned project was meant to diagnose policy failures in afghanistan so the united states would not repeat the mistakes the next time it invaded a country or tried to rebuild a shattered one furthermore at several times the post parroted statements from us officials claiming that some of the lessons learned about their strategic failures were that the us should have killed more people in pakistan and threatened to stay in afghanistan indefinitely without any pushback the post parroted claims that obama s strategy of imposing strict deadlines and promising to bring home all troops by the end of his presidency was destined to fail because the taliban could just wait him out why was obama s broken promise an artificial date for ending the war before it was over if the us truly prioritized preserving taxpayer dollars and the lives of us troops and afghans the open secret is that the us could simply end the afghanistan war any time it wanted to by announcing an unconditional unilateral withdrawal without negotiating with the taliban in another lessons learned interview cited in the afghanistan papers 12 9 19 regarding the strategic challenge of pakistan supporting the taliban and sheltering their leaders despite receiving billions of dollars a year to fight terrorism the post uncritically cited a us official s bloodthirsty support for indefinite occupation and killing taliban members anywhere in pakistan in his december 2016 lessons learned interview crocker said the only way to force pakistan to change would be for trump to keep us troops in afghanistan indefinitely and give them the green light to hunt the taliban on pakistani territory it would allow him to say you worry about our reliability you worry about our withdrawal from afghanistan i m here to tell you that i m going to keep troops there as long as i feel we need them there is no calendar that s the good news the bad news for you is we re going to kill taliban leaders wherever we find them baluchistan punjab downtown islamabad we re going to go find them so maybe you want to do a strategic recalculation while pushing this colonial narrative the post actually tried to make the absurd case that some of the us s strategic failures stemmed from being too generous to afghans and lying to the american public about not wanting to do nation building asserting that nation building is exactly what the united states has tried to do in war battered afghanistan on a colossal scale americans praising their own generosity is a hallmark feature of american colonialism which extended to framing atrocities like slavery the displacement of native americans and the extermination of vietnamese people as generous and the post continues this long tradition by parroting us officials who believed that congress and the white house made matters worse by drenching the destitute country with far more money than it could possibly absorb apparently the problem is not that the us intentionally funnels money to enrich us investors and prop up puppet governments subservient to the us but that the us engages in thoughtless charity the scale of the corruption was the unintended result of swamping the war zone with far more aid and defense contracts than impoverished afghanistan could absorb there was so much excess financed by american taxpayers that opportunities for bribery and fraud became almost limitless according to the interviews the post 12 9 19 claimed that no nation needed more building than afghanistan following continuous warfare since 1979 when it was invaded by the soviet union the post cited frustrated statements from officials working for usaid and the national endowment for democracy ned complaining that the us was wasting too much money on nation building for primitive people in a largely non market society who bartered for items instead of using currency and lacked the education and technical expertise necessary to maintain huge infrastructure projects with officials claiming we were bringing 21st century stuff to a society living in a different time period left unmentioned were us efforts in 1979 to sabotage an indigenous afghan communist movement that was making strides toward ostensible us goals like the education of girls eradicating opium production and expanding access to healthcare by knowingly increasing the probability of luring the russians into their own vietnam war carter s national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski later defended this ruthless strategy that secret operation was an excellent idea it had the effect of drawing the russians into the afghan trap and you want me to regret it nor was there any mention of usaid and the ned being corrupt propaganda arms of the us state department to subvert leftist governments often serving as a pipeline of taxpayer dollars into investors pockets under the guise of promoting development and democracy some us officials even argued that the rampant fraud and waste from american aid contractors were so parasitic that it would be better to funnel contracts to corrupt afghans who would probably take 20 for their personal use or for their extended families and friends than a bunch of expensive american experts who would waste 80 to 90 of the funds on overhead and profit and despite the post s attempts to portray the us as inadvertently building a corrupt dysfunctional afghan government that remains dependent on us military power for its survival it s hard to see how other candid statements about the us military and agencies like the cia giving cash to purchase loyalty from afghan government officials religious leaders and warlords viewed by many afghans as cruel despots don t contradict that assertion in fact herman and chomsky s study the washington connection and third world fascism found that corruption is a primary feature of us client states like the corrupt afghan government with us aid and a favorable foreign investment climate being negatively related to the condition of human rights in these countries hence the numerous reports of afghanistan being open for business tellingly us officials in the afghanistan papers remarked that while the us actively replaced officials seeking to combat corruption or knowingly looked away and let the thievery become more entrenched than ever and retained support for us installed cia assets like hamid karzai who committed mass voter fraud us officials had a dogmatic adherence to free market principles this is supposed to explain why despite their good intentions they consciously imposed economic policies that enriched foreign investors and increased poverty instead of policies that would help afghanistan because us officials considered them incompatible with capitalism this is consistent with michael parenti s study of us foreign policy the sword and the dollar finding that us commitments to democracy and anti corruption are dispensable and easily abandoned indicating insincerity while commitments to opening countries like afghanistan to foreign investment and free market capitalism are uncompromisable but does the us have good intentions then what explains the bush administration s ultimatum to the taliban on behalf of building a pipeline with the unocal corporation to accept our offer of a carpet of gold or we bury you under a carpet of bombs informing the pakistani and indian governments at least five weeks prior to the 9 11 attacks that it would attack afghanistan before the end of october why install a former unocal consultant like karzai as afghanistan s new president after the invasion what explains the refusal to put afghanistan on the state department s list of states sponsoring terrorism despite knowing the taliban were sheltering bin laden other than the fact that it would prevent us oil and construction companies from entering into an agreement with kabul to construct pipelines to central asian oil and gas fields the immediate construction of us military bases and the resulting private businesses servicing them generated massive corporate profits for the military industrial complex and served as guardians for us corporations extracting mineral wealth indications of a planned long term occupation and a launching pad for attacks within and beyond afghanistan s borders explicit statements from the bush doctrine which continued to guide the obama and trump administrations national security strategy explained that real freedom means free trade the moral principle that if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it these are the serious logically consistent explanations for the us invasion and occupation of afghanistan the washington post s afghanistan papers and trove of documents are worth reading through but it s also a contradictory mess containing many distortions and lies by omission the scandal of the afghanistan war is not that the us entered into and prolonged an unwinnable war the scandal is that the us empire s invasion of afghanistan is a war crime in violation of international law and has inflicted imperial violence on the afghan people and it would remain a scandal even if the us accomplished all of its ostensible goals even as the post s scoop exposes us officials as liars and highlights the danger of credulously accepting their ideological framework because they rely so heavily on those officials narratives the afghanistan papers still manage to propagate the old colonial narrative of the empire s good intentions thwarted by backwards foreigners before you go truthout faces a serious

tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living max 1852 1970 15 if we must understand the possible future direction of the society and make it under circumstances directly encountered from the past as said by marx we must therefore attune to dig deeper into the current trends of nature with this and digging deeper into the past and microscoping the current trend of liberia once can safely conclude that george weah and his cabal of state looters are product of historical accident noting to argue the ascendancy of the current regime is an historical accidental packaged and imposed on the people by their class oppressors of course that element is madam ellen johnson sireleaf the sirleafs then used the anger of the people and bought their ignorance of governance to further protect she and her cryonics it then became a necessity to the people to throw liberia to the dogs as it stands we can t locate the flash neither the bones of the states it is now palpable that the current intense human suffering and the crumbled economic structures coupled with an unworkable policy of the weah s government is nothing for him to worry on he sees them as irrelevant and trivial to issues for us it is not a surprise we saw him long ago as a carpenter captaining a cargo ship over a deep sea in the midst harden poverty this president took the airwave only to tell the people how he and some politicians eat at one another house a total display of immense leadership tragedy nearly two years as president of the state he further exposed his least understanding of complicated governance issues especially in a troubling economic and political time like ours this president who has only spoken to the people through a prerecorded and edited audio since his ascendency to the highest seat of the motherland took the airwave on friday december 20 2019 and spewed out compiled gibberish to an unimaginable zenith the interview was nothing but a serious national embarrassment with an irreplaceable damage to the image of state it further validates our consistent argument that president weah swims in idea and leadership insolvency we still doubt that this bankruptcy is even repairable with this go with us as we dig into mr weah s interview comrades people are laid off wages has being unreasonably reduced and persistently delayed inflation is an all time high of 31 30 percent as of august 2019 and the citizens are struggling to cope with prices of commodities as they keep sky rocketing with all of these the president seems not be in control to him the economy pitfall is a nature force the crises are therefore normal as stated by him during his interview such statement that the current crisis of the state is normal sounds hysterical and irreverent to mass of the struggling people who has been relegated further to the dungeon of unrecoverable poverty by mr george weah and his gang of incompetent bigots mr weah need to know that no crises in human history are normal all crises are initiated by enforcing contradictions and other imposing conditions that act on the existing condition therefore the prevailing economic condition of the state is not normal it is a condition melted on our people by you and your predecessor it has become complicated due to the inability of your administration to find a genuine solution we therefore reject your claim that the current situation of the state is normal in a country where the leaders lives with deceptions it signifies dancing on a rope over a deadly valley president weah is that character he is dangling in blatant falsehood and diabolical deceptions he has chosen to run the nation as gangster paradise he befriends corruption with smile and openly frowns on transparency he parades with lies and pompousness while milking the sucking the resources of the state an outcome of chosen an inexperienced carpenter to captain a cargo ship over a deep sea indeed the result will be nothing but a disaster mr president you are noted for poor proper recollection of the past we can therefore not get tire reminding you on january 22 2018 delivering your first legislature agenda to the 54th legislature in the joint chambers of the capitol you asserted that the country s economy is broken and by extension the government on the contrary your predecessor madam sirleaf debunked you on february 13 2018 that the national coffers are not empty with this response your government is yet to respond to madam sirleaf neither have you commissioned a comprehensive audit of her regime another lie pulled out shamelessly by the president is the circumstances surrounding the missing sixteen billion liberia dollars and the twenty five millions united states dollars misapplied by him and samuel tweh he stated in his interview that the l 16billion came in the country but not under his administration here again we see the president as messenger of lies abusing the patience of the people how can president weah tell the public that his administration never received 16 billion when said funds was taken from the freeport of monrovia on march 2 2018 is this not him who was inaugurated on january 22 2018 as the president of liberia of course it is mr weah again we hold weah and his gang of looters solely responsible for our missing billions he is the chief culprit noting can t convince us that president weaah and the cdc are innocent of our missing billion not even an adapted report that was intended to seizure him from public persecution the president s interview was just outrageous as the existing contradictions under his administration the president sat on the radio and rang praises on a samuel tweh the man who looted us 25 million and this president wants us to believe that the current economic crisis is normal no it is not how can you choose to protect a certified thief who manages the fiscal affairs of the state and wants the citizens to believe that the current economic crisis is normal this is a total mockery the president claims that people don t have confidence in the banks you want the people to trust a system that does not meet up with their demand in the midst of an unbearable hardship you create an artificial shortage of money to make the citizens feel that there is true shortage of liberian dollars the banks are holding on to the people money they are losing their friends and relative to death starvation is eating up people their kids are thrown out of school they can t respond to their daily economic demand and you want them to trust this system that does not work for the poor mr president it is now time that you transition from comicality to puffer a matured statesmanship governing a state like liberia is not the same as pushing a round object for ninety minutes when the country has an excessively corrupt and dysfunctional system the president becomes the chief priest of lies and messenger of hate president weah is indeed a chief priest of falsehood his tongue dances better than his legs on his recent interview he said his government does not support war and economy crime court on the contrary this same president wrote the national legislature on september 12 2019 asking them to provide guidance on all legislative and other necessary measures towards the implementation of the truth reconciliation trc report including the establishment of the war and economic crimes court this same president repeated his call for war and economic crimes courts when he addressed world leaders at the un general assembly in september of this year again we can say his recent rejection to bring the perpetrators of crime against humanity to justice by establishing the war and economic crime courts proves that mr weah does act on facts but instant and emotion that dictate to his current position thee impact of his decision is never a concern to him comrades mr weah and the cdc have plundered the state into mess he can t escape his indictment in the court of public persecution he must account the time is not what matters the present condition will inform the next move of the people it is a fact mr weah is a very simple footballing president he does not understand the nuances of complicated governance issue his responses to critical questions as seen in his last interview is a total shame the government is a mixture of incompetent and loosed talking bureaucrats the appointed officials of the government are impressionists who serve not to improve the material condition of the people but to facilitate mass looting of state resources indeed liberia has fallen the economy is crumbling the health system is in ruins the working class labor daily but can t get their poverty wages sadly we have a president that is yet to wake up from his slumber during his interview mr weah elected to praise his predecessor madam sirleaf the political thief who robbed the liberian people of their votes to give him power a sirleaf who along with her clique of thieves looted and bankrupted the national oil company of liberia nocal and other state s resources a sirleaf that embraced nepotism and cronyism with no regard to the rule of law a sirleaf that embraced corruption as her working tool you praise this sirleaf but criticize her party it baffles us to query the difference between madam sirleaf and the unity party the belief that weah and his gang of thieves will deliver liberians from gloomy poverty to prosperity is an illusion that only makes sense to his zealots who have dug themselves in the mud blind sycophancy mr weah is a fair product of fraud and political conspiracy he lacks what it takes to understand the nuances of a complicated governance issue especially in a troubling time like this by all means what mr weah spewed out on december 20 2019 during his purported live radio interview did not in any way surprise us we long predicted mr weah our call to the masses is to remain resilient and battle the excess mess created by madam sirleaf and complicated by his imposed the masses are the makers of history at the point of objective condition they will liberate themselves through the guidance of conscious patriots
youthful new indonesian education and culture minister nadiem makarim dispensed with the usual platitudes on teacher s day this year urging the nation s teachers to start engaging with their students instead of perpetuating an outdated learning process that relies more on rote than serious classroom discussion since his october swearing in makarim also called for a broad program of deregulation an end to year end national examinations regarded as worthless by many educators and a sweeping redesign of the education system to conform better with what is required in the modern workplace but 2020 is already shaping up to be a make or break year for the 35 year old founder of the us 10 billion gojek ride hailing and services platform the youngest minister to have ever held the education portfolio the shakeup in the education system is part of president joko widodo s new emphasis on human development which he said in his state of the nation address last august is key to competing in the international marketplace makarim s approach fits with the need to build up a more highly skilled workforce that meets the expectations of the private sector and allows indonesia to escape from its developing economy status according to statistics indonesia more than 40 of working age indonesians have only a primary school education while just 9 of the labor force has a university degree often achieved without any serious test in critical thinking the biggest challenge to makarim s merdeka belanjar freedom to learn program an entrenched bureaucracy stubbornly opposed to reform for ideological material and even cultural reasons education minister nadiem makarim is tougher than he looks according to friends and associates photo facebook friends insist makarim is tougher than he talks and looks but it is not immediately apparent he is equipped to overcome the institutional resistance he will inevitably face to critical elements of his reform plan nadiem has the same problem as former president b j habibie says educator toenggoel siagian a long time critic of indonesia s learning processes he s a good administrator but it takes a very good politician to win a fight against the bureaucracy like that in education the son of a prominent jakarta lawyer whose family by one close relative s admission has always been obsessed with education makarim received only his early education in indonesia he later enrolled in a singapore boarding school before heading to the ivy league in the united states where he earned a ba in international relations at brown university and an mba at harvard university his gojek which began as a call center offering courier delivery and motorcycle taxi services and is now indonesia s first decacorn company or a start up valued at over us 10 billion has made the young entrepreneur a household name particularly among the nation s millennials some educators believe makarim s extensive overseas learning may be an advantage as he seeks to map out what indonesia despite an impressive literacy rate of 99 6 needs to do to match education standards in neighboring countries with 64 million students 340 000 schools and higher learning institutions and 3 9 million teachers and lecturers indonesia has the world s fourth largest education system students in indonesia lag their regional peers in standardized test results photo twitter un financed by a 2019 budget of 152 6 trillion rupiah 10 8 billion the amount represents only 3 5 of gross domestic product gdp compared to vietnam s 4 3 a nation which is taking the lion s share of regional foreign direct investment fdi at a time when global supply chains are reconfiguring in response to the us china trade war those budgetary funds are clearly being misallocated in the benchmark 2018 organization for economic cooperation and development s oecd program for student assessment pisa 15 year old indonesian students finished 73rd in reading 72nd in maths and 71st in science out of 79 countries surveyed indonesia s aggregate score combining all three disciplines was 1 146 representing just 78 of the oecd s average and a decline of two percentage points over the previous survey in 2015 more worrying indonesia ranked last in the percentage of employed adults with a tertiary degree it has long been recognized that indonesia s education system is seriously flawed with little improvement in quality made in the two decades since governments began devoting 20 of the national budget to a problem that is now widely seen as a major obstacle to national development certain political analysts even suggest poor education lies at the heart of the country s faltering progress towards democratization a surfeit in learning that allows an unquestioning populace to be easily manipulated by self interested politicians and their bureaucratic and corporate allies makarim seems to agree with that assessment every young person must be able to think independently he told parliament s education commission recently stressing the need for a stronger connection between teachers students and parents that technological advances in learning can t provide before makarim s appointment the education ministry s top post was seemingly perpetually reserved for muhammadiyah the country s second largest and mostly urban based mass muslim organization which has done little over the years to meet the glaring need for reform indonesian students share a computer screen in a file photo photo facebook indonesian children may be starting school earlier and staying longer but as former education minister anies baswedan pointed out in 2016 the country is facing what he called an education emergency beset by low quality instruction poor learning outcomes inadequate facilities and discipline problems siagian believes makarim is on the right track with his decision to end the national examination in 2021 and to retrain teachers in new classroom methods that earn them greater trust and allow schools the freedom to be more imaginative in their overall approach to education if they do that they will overturn the apple cart he says pointing to failed attempts in the past to find an alternative method of measuring academic accomplishment kids will learn what is important instead of wasting their time having to memorize everything makarim says he plans to replace the national exam with a so called assessment of minimum competency and survey of character but he has made it clear it will not be used to measure a student s eligibility to move to the next grade that will fall to the national standard school examination usbn managed only by schools and built around written tests or other more comprehensive exercises that will give teachers and schools greater freedom in evaluating learning outcomes siagian contends that too many outside vested interests are involved in indonesia s education system ranging from the military to the printing industry the latter of which benefits from lucrative examination paper and textbook contracts andrew rosser a melbourne university political economist laid out a crushing indictment of those same outside influences in a 2018 lowy institute paper that is now viewed as an empirical work on the problems afflicting indonesian education rather than producing indonesians capable of finding jobs and other opportunities in the global economy he wrote their interests have been in the development of an education system that helps them to accumulate resources distribute patronage mobilize political support and exercise political control university students protest outside the indonesian parliament in jakarta on september 24 2019 photo twitter tempo their focus has been on expanding the scope and reach of education rather than improving its quality his report said they also have an interest in limiting the public funding for education to ensure that government resources are concentrated on areas of public spending that offer them better opportunities to accumulate rents rosser argues that a fundamental shift is required in the underlying political and social relationships that have characterized the political economy and shaped the evolution of education in the absence of such a shift interventions aimed at improving the quality of education are likely to be stymied by political and social forces opposed to reform he wrote in the report it is that and the questionable ability of teachers to adapt that will present makarim with his biggest challenges in 2020 and beyond

new home sales for november were reported at 719 000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis saar sales for the previous three months were revised down combined sales were above 700 thousand saar for four consecutive months and in five of the last six months the best six month stretch since 2007 annual sales in 2019 will be the best year for new home sales since 2007 earlier new home sales at 719 000 annual rate in november click on graph for larger image this graph shows new home sales for 2018 and 2019 by month seasonally adjusted annual rate sales in november were up 16 9 year over year compared to november 2018 year to date through november sales are up 9 8 compared to the same period in 2018 the comparison for december is easy so sales will likely be up double digits in 2019 compared to 2018 a solid year for new home sales and here is another update to the distressing gap graph that i first started posting a number of years ago to show the emerging gap caused by distressed sales the distressing gap graph shows existing home sales left axis and new home sales right axis through november 2019 this graph starts in 1994 but the relationship had been fairly steady back to the 60s following the housing bubble and bust the distressing gap appeared mostly because of distressed sales even though distressed sales are down significantly following the bust new home builders focused on more expensive homes so the gap closed slowly now the gap is mostly closed and i expect it to close a little more however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes another way to look at this is a ratio of existing to new home sales this ratio was fairly stable from 1994 through 2006 and then the flood of distressed sales kept the number of existing home sales elevated and depressed new home sales note this ratio was fairly stable back to the early 70s but i only have annual data for the earlier years in general the ratio has been trending down since the housing bust and is getting close to the historical ratio and i expect this ratio will trend down a little more note existing home sales are counted when transactions are closed and new home sales are counted when contracts are signed so the timing of sales is different

caracas venezuela ani camacho has watched her 5 year old son zabdiel battle cancer for years the despair briefly turned to hope when she learned last december that zabdiel was going to get a potentially life saving bone marrow transplant in italy a complex medical procedure he could not receive in venezuela we were super happy camacho said all the family had left to do was buy plane tickets and get visas she said but she and zabdiel never left venezuela because the program that would have allowed him to travel became enmeshed in the country s economic chaos and was put on hold they remain in caracas traveling back and forth between an apartment lent by a family member and j m de los ríos children s hospital where zabdiel has spent much of his life and made most of his friends it s so much anguish desperation impotence camacho 40 said as she waited for her husband to bring her son home from the hospital where the boy was getting a spinal tap we are out of options she said with venezuela in the grip of a severe economic crisis spanning several years children like zabdiel have been caught in the center as the humanitarian toll worsens with no immediate end in sight aid workers and doctors told nbc news the boy s struggle for medical care was emblematic of a broader crisis that was causing a generational toll as children continue to languish at key points in their mental and physical development janeth márquez director of the catholic aid organization cáritas in venezuela said the three biggest problems facing venezuela s children are an inability to get medical care or supplies malnutrition and the effect of families being separated as parents leave the country to find work to be able to send money back home about a third of the country s children need help accessing basic nutrition health and education services unicef said in june the united nations agency also said that mortality of children under 5 had increased by more than half from 2014 to 2017 zabdiel is among dozens of children at the hospital in need of bone marrow transplants hundreds of children and young people received the transplants and aftercare treatment in italy under a 2010 agreement that was financed by venezuela s state run oil company zabdiel camacho has spent much of his life at a hospital in caracas venezuela courtesy ani camacho but that program has been suspended four children whose families were also hoping for transplants died at the hospital in may another child on the list has died since then according to advocates venezuela s government claims u s sanctions have frozen funds that could have paid for the expensive medical treatments while critics of president nicolás maduro say it is another example that venezuela s medical system is in turmoil amid mismanagement and corruption camacho said the children have been caught in the middle with their lives at stake they are the most affected by this situation she said my son doesn t know anything about this but he is in a fight and a war we would collapse on a wednesday in june a line of people mostly women holding babies and young children stretched out the door of the emergency medical clinic that cáritas runs for families in need some were there to see an on site pediatrician others because they were sick and needed treatment or medications they could not otherwise afford márquez said there has been a sharp increase in people needing their services since 2014 when only about 10 people would come to their main offices now hundreds of people come every day including an influx of middle class people seeking medicine they can no longer afford or that is not available otherwise auribel plazuela 31 arrived at the clinic that morning for a follow up appointment for her 9 month old daughter and to receive asthma treatment for herself plazuela said that about two months earlier her baby appeared weak and was coughing and coughing so she brought her to the clinic where she was given medication along with a treatment plan i completed the treatment and thank god the baby hasn t suffered any more she said as other children cried while being seen by a pediatrician at the same time a little girl in a pink and white top and shorts was given an injection to treat nausea and vomiting it s truly very difficult people come here every day that truly need this plazuela said in other hospitals it s very difficult because you have to pay and with the situation the way it is now you can t plazuela said she has asthma and had been having trouble breathing for the last three days so she came to cáritas and waited to receive a nebulizer treatment she said she brought her daughter in again for a check up and the doctor found her to be in good health plazuela said she knew other parents of children with special needs such as epilepsy who went to the clinic because they needed very expensive medication without the services the clinic provides we would collapse she said all of us venezuelans are going through the same thing she said you buy one thing or the other i buy food or i buy medicine and in the end i need both this crisis is taking children the government s data from 2016 shows that maternal mortality shot up 65 percent in one year infant mortality rose by 30 percent to more than 11 000 babies under the age of 1 dying in that single year márquez said her organization works with communities who have faced an onslaught by the crisis in venezuela and has seen the toll it has on families sadly we are seeing how this crisis is taking children she said if the crisis continues we are looking at a dark horizon for people who do not have money for the most vulnerable she said maduro s critics say his government is to blame for the country s woes and the escalating collapse of the economy under his presidency through mismanagement and corruption while maduro has long claimed harsh u s sanctions are ravaging the economy carlos 30 sits on a pile of trash where he looks for food in caracas on april 10 2019 eva marie uzcategui getty images in 2018 venezuela s inflation rate rose to 130 060 percent according to the government s data in the third quarter of 2018 the country s gdp shrank 22 5 percent over the prior year maduro who took power in 2013 as the heir to president hugo chávez remains in office despite opposition leader juan guaidó s call for mass demonstrations and a military uprising at the end of april but mass defections never materialized and much of the military has remained loyal to maduro guaidó declared himself venezuela s interim president in late january after maduro s disputed re election last year more than 50 countries including the united states recognize guaidó as the country s interim leader this hurts the children the most dr julio castro who works at the central university of venezuela said a major contributing factor to health issues in venezuela was the lack of consistent access to clean safe drinking water which has led to outbreaks of diseases including hepatitis a tap water is not considered safe to drink and most people who can afford to do so boil the water or buy packaged bottles even in caracas the capital some people do not have running water every day he said while others store water in tanks that can become breeding grounds for mosquito borne diseases or drink from polluted rivers or lakes plazuela said that while she has a water tank sometimes the water comes out yellow or dirty so she always boils the water for herself and her four children márquez said cáritas latest study found that 35 percent of children were suffering from chronic malnutrition living with nutritional deficiencies for at least five years in 2017 that number was 27 percent according to cáritas in a statement to united nations human rights chief michelle bachelet cáritas highlighted several critical issues including delays in growth because of chronic malnutrition the charity said it had evaluated more than 30 000 children in the last three years and found that 6 out of 10 families interviewed are begging and searching for food in garbage dumps four in 10 have had to sell belongings to afford food and another four in 10 have had to separate as a family to continue surviving cáritas said the united nations said in june that more than 4 million migrants and refugees have left venezuela in the last few years the pace of migration has skyrocketed since the end of 2015 the u n said with the number increasing by a million in seven months from last november to june globally venezuelans are one of the single largest population groups displaced from their country the international organization for migration and u n refugee agency said in a statement márquez said that cáritas great concern is that emigration continues to increase this year which totally destroys the family destroying homes we say we have mothers who don t have children and children who don t have mothers she said cáritas runs a weekly soup kitchen which drew a hundred people on a recent day a priest led the group in prayer and volunteers passed out bread and bowls of soup containing beef potatoes corn carrots onions and lentils workers said it was the only time many of the families ate protein during the week residents collect water released through a pipe in an abandoned construction site which contains chemicals products in caracas on april 4 2019 roman camacho sopa images lightrocket via getty images ana rojo had some soup while holding her 1 year old son at a table surrounded by other family members as a mother of 12 children rojo said the soup kitchen was essential for her family many venezuelans including rojo s family rely on a government subsidized food aid program but the aid only lasts her family a few days she said rojo said sometimes she would just start to cry because she would have to send her kids to bed hungry you send them to bed with just a glass of water and that s not fair to them she said rojo said her 5 year old son sometimes faints and turns purple he starts to vomit because he hasn t eaten this hurts the children the most she said because you re an adult and you endure but they don t the situation is getting worse every day dr castro said the country s continuing hyperinflation has worsened health issues for families it s impossible for them to afford medicine for any diseases he said hospitals throughout the country also do not have the medicine they need or water on an everyday basis some have problems with electricity he said my concern is that the situation is getting worse every day castro said rosa colina whose daughter cristina 18 is also in need of a bone marrow transplant described being in hospitals lacking medicine sometimes when medication was available she had to pay for it out of pocket expenses she cannot afford cristina suffers from a blood disorder called thalassemia major and developed hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in 2016 colina said she has had to go out in the street and beg for money in the hope of being able to afford medication cristina colina suffers from a blood disorder called thalassemia major and developed hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in 2016 courtesy rosa colina the hospitalizations and increasing health complications have taken over cristina s daily life a year ago she required a wheelchair following the development of a blood clot and while she has since regained some mobility her parents need to physically help her get around before 2016 cristina was a model but not anymore she used to play violin she left that too her mom said through tears colina said she hopes a transplant could give cristina a chance at a normal life and to accomplish the goals she has held for so much of her young life some 500 bone marrow transplants for adults and children have been done in the country at a hospital in caracas and at another in the city of valencia since 2000 said dr francisco ramírez director of the bone marrow transplant program at the hospital of clinics caracas but in the last two years the number of transplants has decreased from about 25 a year to nine last year and three so far this year he said this is mainly due to the difficulty in getting medications of getting what corresponds to the costs he said beyond the limited resources children like zabdiel who do not have a matching donor in venezuela have had to look internationally for potential matches and transplant treatments as venezuela currently does not have the methodology or ability to take bone marrow matches from international sources and bring them to venezuela to treat the children he said the country and aid organizations are looking into other ways to give transplants to children like zabdiel but limited resources are again a major issue he said maduro s government has said coercive measures by the u s government in the form of sanctions have prevented the state run oil company pdvsa from transferring money for the transplant treatments venezuela sent the funds through pdvsa and they were retained in novo banco portugal thanks to the sanctions and the criminal blockade venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza said in a statement in april while the u s government maintains the pdvsa citgo blockade in venezuela the lists of citizens who hope to benefit from the social health program grow he added referring to the u s subsidiary of pdvsa enrica giavatto director of the association for bone marrow transplant said since 2006 the organization has brought 487 venezuelans most of them women and young people to italy pdvsa had initially been covering the cost of transplants she said in june 2018 the group received funding related to the last two months of 2018 but since then they have not received any additional payments giavatto said she said the association has not been paid costs related to the transplants and after care treatment for all of 2018 and 2019 the group has continued to provide care for the 19 children and adults who are in italy receiving treatment as part of the program she said giavatto said that because italy s hospitals are public and because of the high debts owed because of the lack of payment the association is not able to take more patients including zabdiel she added that the venezuelan government did try to make a bank transfer of more than 4 million euros to the association but that was stopped by portuguese bank novo banco she said venezuela asked the group to then open a bank account in russia to bypass the sanctions she said the group did but has not heard an answer novo banco did not immediately respond to a request for comment katherine martínez director of prepara familia a nongovernmental humanitarian organization has been advocating for the families and said the venezuelan government has the duty to find other sources of funding for the transplants we re talking about the lives of children that are very much at risk she said these are families that are doing all they can back at the apartment in caracas where camacho lives the door opened and zabdiel arrived home accompanied by his father leonardo amaya the boy was dressed in a white button down shirt and gray corduroy pants a white bandage around his right wrist he played with brightly colored toy cars that he had separated into groups of autobots and decepticons dueling factions from the transformers series after a relapse in 2018 zabdiel is receiving maintenance treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that includes daily medication chemotherapy and lumbar punctures his mother said camacho described zabdiel as a loving and happy child throughout their struggles family photos showed the boy dressed as superman in one he wears a superman t shirt and cape a mask covering his mouth with his right hand bandaged in another he wears a superman hoodie his mouth again covered with a mask giving a thumbs up to the camera as their wait continues camacho said she lives in fear that my son will die waiting for a transplant i am afraid that we will have to give up our dreams for our son she said
despite recent protests in places such as the economist proclaiming that the world is getting richer and more equal the reality is that global capitalism is producing or reproducing three trends that portend bad news a north south individual and a generational wealth gap thomas piketty s 2013 capital in the twenty first century reminded the academic and broader community to the reality of growing economic inequality in the world while nineteenth century writers as diverse as john stuart mill henry george karl marx and rosa luxembourg pointed to the production of economic inequality and the challenges it posed to democracy by the middle of the last century this critique had largely been muted it happened because from the 1930s to the 1970s globally inequality across the world decreased due to instabilizers such as two world wars a great economic depression and ascent of labor after that it began to creep up dramatically as the impact of these instabilizers weakened and wealth and income began to concentrate again the rosy picture by the late 1960s was that capitalism had been tamed and an egalitarian future was upon us thus refuting the doomsayers mathematically piketty expressed this process with the equation r g suggesting that when the rate of return on capital r over the long run is greater than the rate of growth g inequality increases more specifically when return on capital increases more rapidly than income from labor in terms of wages the gap between the rich and poor increases how this new inequality played out in the united states for example was dramatic a 2011 congressional budget office study found that the after tax income gap and this includes after calculating in transfers payments and welfare between the top one percent of the population and everyone else more than tripled since 1979 after tax income for the top one percent increased by 275 between 1973 and 2007 for the bottom quintile it was merely 18 while for middle class or middle three quintiles it increased by not quite 40 according to the census bureau the median family income fell in 2012 from 51 100 to 51 017 with average americans earning less now than they did in real dollars in 1989 however there is some good news since 2009 the income of the wealthiest 1 has increased by 31 but income only tells part of the story maldistributions in wealth is also exacerbating and growing according to the institute for policy studies in 2007 the top one percent controls almost 34 of the wealth in the country with half of the population possessing less than 3 the racial disparities for wealth mirror those of income an april 2013 pew research center report documents how since the crash of 2008 that the mean net worth of households in the upper 7 of the wealth distribution rose by an estimated 28 while the mean net worth of households in the lower 93 dropped by 4 the richest have recovered nicely from the great recession the rest of us have not done so well but some have speculated that since the world has recovered from the great recession of 2008 the gap between the rich and poor would narrow but that is not the case the most recent and powerful documentation of that is credit suisse s global wealth report 2019 the credit suisse report has largely been ignored by the mainstream and alternative media as well as by economists and policymakers it presents several startling macro and micro conclusions one while aggregate global wealth reached a record high of 360 6 trillion by mid 2019 and over the last two decades global wealth gaps have decreased somewhat its distribution was hugely uneven north america and europe are 17 of the global population but control 57 of the wealth while much has been made of the rising economic power and wealth of china the u s by far remains the wealthiest state in the world also possessing by far the greatest number of millionaires and ultra high net worth individuals wealth per adult reached a new high of 70 850 however 57 of all adults have a net worth of less than 10 000 while less than 1 of the population controls 44 of the world s wealth the top 10 of the adults possess 82 of the global wealth women have gained wealth over the last two decades due to their increase in labor force participation but the relative gain to men has been modest and varies by country finally the millennial generation are suffering in wealth accumulation compared to their parental baby boomers mostly as a result of high household costs and decreased incomes especially post 2008 recession overall the credit suisse study reports that what used to be called the north south developed versus undeveloped or first world third world economic gap persists second there is a powerful intergenerational wealth gap what does all this mean in the short and long term neo liberal economic policies but domestically and in terms of globalization have mostly benefitted the already privileged in terms of countries generations and individuals countries and people that were the winners 20 or 30 years ago continue to be the winners second despite protests by president donald trump that the global trade system has taken advantage of america the u s overall continues to be a winner proving that the american century proclaimed in 1942 by henry luce is still a winner at least for some thus policy wise trump would be smarter to have left the trade and other policies in place since they were to the advantage of the u s longer term the question is whether global capitalism and democracy can survive as wealth inequalities grow worse by the year there is much to argue that the increased wealth disparities which are impacting especially the working class are fueling resentment against immigration and democracy in effect the policies that have produced the inequalities are undermining the institutions that have produced them it is doubtful that a global authoritarian turn will prop up democracy and the declining delivery of economic goods by capitalism is undermining non first world and future generational support for democracy the picture suggests a future less democratic and maybe less capitalist yet what exactly these new institutions will be and what the global order will look like is open to question

unions are becoming more popular and as that popularity grows so will labor strikes 2019 showed this perfectly during the united automobile workers uaw strike of general motors the fight is also an example of the growing disparities in our economy under president donald trump and reflect why we need unions in the first place margarida jorge is the executive director of health care for american

can opt out at any time advertisement as this decade comes to an end it s imperative that we reflect on the growing power of unions across the country according to gallup union approval is at a near 50 year high with 64 of americans approving of labor unions that more than half of the country approves of unions not only signals organized labor s enduring strength but also highlights growing public recognition that we need unions today more than ever the united automobile workers uaw strike of general motors one of the most successful union movements of the year is evidence that workers can leverage increased strength through unions the successful strike showed many across the country that joining unions and demanding essential benefits like healthcare and higher wages is well worth the fight the 40 day strike which started mid september by roughly 50 000 members of uaw working at general motors was about much more than corporate profits and stable jobs that can support families advertisement it was about the right to affordable healthcare the ways that trump continues to tilt the economy in favor of corporations and billionaires at the expense of working americans and the significance of unions and collective action and for that reason every person in the country should pay attention to the lessons of the strike as we head into a new decade of labor fights gm was doing its best to slim down healthcare benefits for the last three years gm s profits have soared the company has made 35 billion in profits since 2015 but the benefit of those profits haven t extended far beyond their corporate executives and shareholders indeed as part of the negotiations with uaw gm tried to force workers to pay 500 more for their healthcare a move that was ultimately turned back by the union a decade ago american workers helped bail out the big three automakers gm ford and chrysler losing 11 2 billion in the process to save an industry that employs millions then the 2017 republican tax plan gifted gm another 157 million in tax breaks in 2018 alone instead of investing those tax savings back into the jobs that american tax dollars worked to salvage in 2009 gm announced it was laying off 14 000 workers right before the holidays in 2018 advertisement at the same time instead of providing better benefits or pay raises to its workers the company spent roughly 100 million to buy back gm s own shares after gm workers went on strike calling for fair wages job security and rejecting the 500 increase to their healthcare costs the corporation initially dropped the workers healthcare altogether and with no warning while gm restored their coverage during the strike the company s shameful action put worker s healthcare at risk related stories in nashville the wife of a gm worker woke up after surgery to find out that her healthcare had been canceled while she was being operated on gm s decision to reinstate healthcare was likely motivated more by public pressure and the company s concern for its reputation bottom line rather than with workers health or well being advertisement gm s attempts to slice healthcare mirrors trump s actions gm s attempts to make their healthcare plans less affordable were abhorrent but not surprising given what we ve seen from washington under president donald trump s leadership after all the president s first priority when he got elected was to take healthcare from millions of people by repealing the affordable care act aca by including the repeal of the aca s individual mandate in their 2017 tax reform bill republicans guaranteed that their tax bill would result in more people without health insurance and increase the cost of coverage for millions of americans this provision of the tax law gave trump and the gop an opportunity to take the aca which the supreme court had already ruled constitutional back to the courts with the texas v united states case if courts rule in the republicans favor the aca and its coverage protection for people living with pre existing conditions would be overturned possibly leaving as many as 20 million more americans without healthcare the aca increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations to provide coverage and lower costs for low and moderate income americans striking the law would shift billions back to rich annually including 45 billion to households making over 250 000 a year and 34 billion to households making over 1 million yearly advertisement during debate over the republican tax bill we heard members of congress argue that their tax plan would help american workers and protect their jobs but what s happening today at gm makes it clear once again that corporations millionaires and billionaires are the only ones benefiting trump touted the new law again and again as economic stimulus for the working class but so far the average workers bonus from the bill has been 1 cent while the cost of groceries rent and healthcare keep going up the gm strike is a lesson for the rest of america from ceaseless attacks on affordable healthcare to stagnant wages and corporate tax giveaways the trump economy hasn t changed workers lives for the better that s why the uaw s strike against gm isn t just about their members it was a model for how all americans have to confront corporate power to ensure every family in the country can make a living and get affordable health care advertisement the gm workers fight for better healthcare matters to every single american they are an example of how we together we can successfully take on the corporate callousness and greed that trump and republicans have only further enabled in order to protect our families and improve our jobs all americans need to stand with them and say no to hikes in healthcare costs whether at their own job or in response to the trump administration s actions this fight was about more than gm it was about the kind of country we want to live in and whom we prioritize a handful of corporate executives and shareholders or thousands of rank and file workers like the recent strikes we ve seen from teachers and telecommunications workers this one affirmed a lesson that unions have conveyed time and time again when workers unite and fight for the benefits and fair treatment they deserve they can win margarida jorge is the executive director of health care for america now hcan the national grassroots coalition that from 2008 2013 ran a campaign to pass protect and promote the affordable care act aca

karachi foreign investment in government debt papers continued with the addition of over 400 million within a month the latest data issued by the state bank of pakistan sbp on friday shows that the treasury bills attracted 413m during a month which pushed the total foreign investment in government papers to 1 413 billion on november 25 the total inflow in the t bills was 1bn which has since jumped to 1 4bn reflecting the growing confidence of foreign investors these inflows in local debt papers support to some extent the government s claim that investment environment has improved prime minister imran khan has recently announced that 2020 will be the year of economic progress and stability around half a billion dollar investment in the equity market could not stay and the outflow of 542m practically reduced the overall inflows in t bills and equity during a month period the collective inflows were 1 956bn during the month this is the first time that pakistan has succeeded to attract such large foreign inflows in government papers which has affected other investment too for example the foreign direct investment during 5mfy20 surged by 78 per cent to 850m financial sector which has been investing heavily in government papers believes that the high returns on t bills were the main attraction for foreigners currently the returns on three six and 12 months t bills are 13 51pc 13 28pc and 13 24pc respectively however analysts believe the new direction of foreign investment was due to state bank s encouragement and marketing for the t bills which paid the returns a debate is going on among the financial and corporate sector regarding the policy interest rate which is the key attraction for foreign inflows in t bills the sbp has indicated that the interest may not be changed during this fiscal year due to high inflationary pressure in the economy the present interest rate which is at 13 25pc is being criticised by the business sector as it discourages investment in new ventures and expansions details show that the inflows in t bills are largely coming from two countries the united states and the united kingdom the investment from the uk was 720m while 621m came from the us the only other significant inflow amount was worth 48m from luxemburg published in dawn december 28th 2019
amid the drama surrounding impeachment both parties came together on one area of shared support spending enormous amounts of taxpayer dollars and adding to the 23 1 trillion national debt congress had little time to properly review fiscal 2020 spending bills which weighed in at more than 2 000 pages of clunky text the legislation contained a multitude of flaws including lobbyist driven handouts and a private pension bailout that could open the door for even larger bailouts down the line this is a business as usual conclusion to an irresponsible decade the degree to which washington has been reckless with the nation s finances is hard to comprehend next year absolutely everything is on the line defend your principles before it is too late find out more now since 2010 the federal government has spent 293 750 per household federal spending started the decade at an artificially high level due to the 2009 economic stimulus package there was a slight dip after the stimulus ended and the tea party wave ushered in a brief period of restraint in congress sadly this flicker of responsibility was short lived according to the office of management and budget and the congressional budget office federal spending totaled 37 6 trillion from 2010 through 2019 spread across 128 million households per the census bureau that yields 293 750 in spending for every household federal spending in 2019 was equivalent to the combined economies of 16 states in fiscal 2019 which ended sept 30 the federal government doled out 4 4 trillion the full scope of that much money is virtually impossible for the human mind to grasp one way to understand the sheer enormity is by comparing it to the size of state economies to match the amount that the federal government spent in fiscal 2019 one would need to add the total economic output of alabama arizona connecticut indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota missouri nevada oklahoma oregon south carolina tennessee utah and wisconsin we should treat the notion that this level of federal activity is too small with deep skepticism spending per household is up 47 since 2000 the federal government spent 34 700 per household in 2019 which is serious money no matter what part of the country you live in is nearly 35 000 per household too much spending to put it in context we can go back to the last time the economy had a surging stock market and unemployment under 4 the year 2000 back then federal spending was about 2 49 trillion after adjusting for inflation divided by the number of households in 2000 the government spent just 23 600 per household in today s dollars that means that the spending increase from 2000 to now is a staggering 47 per household even after controlling for inflation in real terms the federal government is nearly half again larger than it was less than two decades ago the budget would balance today if spending had grown more modestly with the federal government growing so quickly it should come as no surprise that this year s deficit likely will exceed 1 trillion even if the economy remains strong some on the left counter that the high deficits are primarily the fault of the tax cuts and jobs act signed into law just before christmas 2017 and that the solution is funneling more taxpayer dollars to washington that assertion is incorrect once again a comparison to 2000 is instructive revenue per household adjusted for inflation was 26 750 in 2000 today it s roughly 27 000 even after the 2017 tax cut if federal spending had grown based only on population and inflation starting in 2000 today s trillion dollar deficit would turn into a surplus policymakers should recognize that the federal government has grown far too quickly since there is no way to undo the past they should take some prudent steps to return the country to sound financial footing first congress should trim excessive spending that has accumulated over the years the heritage foundation s blueprint for balance offers hundreds of policy ideas to save money by eliminating waste making social security and medicare sustainable and slashing perks for politically connected industries second congress should enact meaningful guardrails that rein in future spending growth one model for reform comes from switzerland where the budget balances over the course of a business cycle closer to home the taxpayer bill of rights approved by colorado voters in 1992 limits spending based on a combination of revenue inflation and population growth such rules would create headaches for washington by forcing big spending members of congress to make tough decisions rather than all of them getting what they want by abusing the national credit card yet this would merely force legislators to behave the way most families do every day namely pay for necessities first and only add extras if there s cash to spare congress is ending the decade on a note of fiscal irresponsibility but next year lawmakers have a fresh chance to do right by america
there may be three billionaires running for president but that hasn t stopped many democratic candidates from railing against the ultra wealthy especially massachusetts sen elizabeth warren coming together to create an economy a government an energy system that works for all of us not just the one percent vermont sen bernie sanders said at a campaign rally meanwhile warren is proposing sweeping cultural change and ambitious plans such as her 21 trillion dollar proposal for medicare for all that leaves more moderate competitors like minnesota sen amy klobuchar to question how she will pay for it in turn warren blasted her moderate democratic rivals seeking the white house accusing them of naively accepting republican calls for unity rather than standing up to the rich while too quickly bending to the whims of their own wealthy donors the massachusetts senator strongly defended her progressive vision for the nation built on using new taxes to extend benefits such as universal child care and health coverage warren didn t name former vice president joe biden or mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana but she was clearly taking aim at them suggesting that long simmering tensions between the party s centrist and progressives wings are boiling over unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not counting on republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big business accountability they have opposed under democratic presidents for a generation warren said during a speech at the new hampshire institute of politics unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if democrats adopt republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well connected will stand down related elizabeth warren health care plan pledges no middle class tax increase the cornerstone of warren s policy centers around a 2 cent wealth tax on those with fortunes over 50 million dollars which she claims will pay for things like the expansion of charter schools and free college for those who qualify well i don t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations i want one that works for our family warren told a cheering crowd at a campaign event and in order to pay for medicare for all warren proposes a 6 percent tax on anyone who s worth over a billion dollars and that has led to clear battle lines drawn between warren and those considered billionaires who argue the senator s plans are punitive and will dismantle their life s work while disincentivizing others who want to get rich one day she pledges to use that tax money to offer universal child care and wipe out most student debt for 42 million americans while helping finance a medicare for all plan providing government sponsored health care nationwide elizabeth warren is of course the person that wall street dislikes the most said hal dash a democratic strategist but warren is not backing down her latest campaign ad is aimed right at the uber wealthy you built it at least in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped paid the bill we re americans we want to make these investments all we re saying is when you make it big pitch in two cents warren said emphatically at a campaign rally she s even taken a swipe at billionaire democratic hopeful michael bloomberg a former new york city mayor i don t believe that elections ought to be for sale warren said in an appearance on bloomberg warren remains bunched near the top of the polls with biden buttigieg and sanders the race s other strong progressive voice but rather than contrasting herself with sanders to shore up the democratic left she has increasingly gone after the mayor and the former vice president as well as bloomberg the division is growing as the first votes of the democratic primary near and there s mounting concern that no clear front runner will emerge from the initial slate of contests nobody is perfect and nobody is pure and there s no question that any democrat running for president would be a whole lot better than donald trump warren said thursday to applause she added later but voters will not trust a candidate who won t make a single difficult decision that might cut down on the access and influence of wealthy donors and voters will be right in response to warren s speech buttigieg senior adviser lis smith suggested that the senator may ultimately undermine democratic unity sen warren s idea of how to defeat donald trump is to tell people who don t support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party smith said warren has centered her candidacy on proposing structural changes to remake the political and economic system but some potential hurdles of doing so were on display earlier this month when the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model which provides nonpartisan analysis of public policy proposals released findings showing that warren s wealth tax will raise 2 3 trillion to 2 7 trillion over 10 years that s as much as 1 4 trillion less than warren s campaign estimates the analysis also concluded that the new taxes would cause the economy to contract 0 9 percent to 2 1 percent by 2050 and says the new tax would reduce private capital formation enough to drive the u s economy s average wage down 0 9 percent to 2 3 percent even affecting households not rich enough to qualify for the tax warren s wealth tax has been among the most popular and most scrutinized proposals of her campaign although sanders has proposed an even higher tax on top fortunes warren s has given her an economic populist edge and even prompted crowds at her rallies to break into chants of 2 cents responding to the analysis after her new hampshire speech warren said it wasn t really based on what she wants to do saying the authors changed provisions and then analyzed something else i understand there are people who want to throw up a lot of dust around this because they don t really have any comeback to that central question and that is why aren t we asking the folks at the very top to pitch in a couple of cents so that we could actually invest in opportunity and everyone else she said still even warren herself acknowledged the potential difficulty of her agenda noting in her speech will i have a magic wand to enact my full agenda of course not no president does i know i will have to compromise but that s not where we start she said she d exploit senate procedures allowing some legislation to pass with a simple majority noting that republicans used that to pass the tax cuts championed by trump but pulling that off is difficult since the chamber rules would require near universal democratic unity the associated press contributed

the nigerian senate under the leadership of senator ahmed lawn has fallen it has completely surrendered to major general muhammadu buhari and needs to be saved from itself before it does irreparable damage to the meaning of checks and balances in a constitutional democracy since senator lawan emerged as the senate president he has left no one in doubt by his utterances and body language that the national assembly particularly the senate is an extension of the executive arm of government not many paid attention then when some of his colleagues who knew him well cautioned nigerians that he was a yes man and a bootlicker who would pass laws that are anti people and anti democracy to please his alter ego general buhari who routinely pooh poohs the niceties and the processes of democracy they had argued that it was dangerous to have such a man as the president of the senate and leader of the national assembly and a ruthless dictator as head of the executive just a few months in office as senate president lawan in tow with his deputy ovie omo agege is proving to be just what some of his colleagues had warned against a buhari lackey lest we forget senator omo agege who led thugs to steal mace from the senate last year was never charged to court being a buharist and has now even been rewarded with the position of deputy senate president advertisement shaka momodu immediately he was elected he paid a visit to the dictator whence he was down on all fours thanking his benefactor general buhari for making it possible this critical arm of government is a pathetic shadow of the 8th senate and a rubber stamp for the dictator clearly the atmosphere in the senate is now dull uneventful and enervating somebody recently described it as a low energy environment a clear reflection of an uninspiring pliant and a never do well senate leadership working against the interest of the people this buhari s lackey made it clear recently the senate would approve any request it receives from the dictator because according to him he means well for the country like the general lawan detests debate he overrules all objections and gavels everything through compare the nonsense going on in the senate and house of representatives with debates on issues in the us congress or parliamentary debates in the uk and you may see yourself shedding tears for nigeria as things stand only nigerians can save themselves from this reign of certificate forgers school dropouts amoral men and women liars corrupt politicians and convicted criminals who converge on the hallowed chamber as our lawmakers advertisement the indecent haste he railroaded the senate into passing the 2020 budget left no one in any doubt as to his determination to please his master in the process he sacrificed rigorous inspection and interrogation of the budget details and figures to set a record of timely passage of the budget bill no sooner had the senate settled down than the leadership of the national assembly went on a spending showy binge procuring luxury and operational vehicles for the lawmakers at the end of that exercise n5 5 billion of taxpayers money had been shelled out for things that added no value to the lives of the ordinary people when some nigerians protested about the reckless extravagance of the national assembly with taxpayers money the lawmakers yelled abuses and obscenities at them then as if looking for what to do it resurrected the hate speech bill that had been put in abeyance included even tougher penalty including capital punishment for some category of offences despite the intense opposition of the public to it lawan left no one in doubt of his insensitivity when he said recently that it would be passed into law the truth is discerning and right thinking nigerians never expected much from lawan considering the circumstances of his emergence but he has even confounded some of them beyond anything they had imagined by his total abdication and subjugation of the legislature to the executive arm of government advertisement on the raging issue of general buhari s request for approval to borrow a fresh 30 billion lawan has already stated he would approve the request without asking questions irrespective of the grave implications for the economy for the future of the youth and unborn generations who would bear the burden of repaying the huge loan and astronomical service charges on it what specifically is this 30 billion meant for anyway which projects are the money tied to it is just not enough to tell the people you want to embark on infrastructure development what has the regime done with all the monies it has borrowed in the last four years senator shehu sani former chairman senate committee on local and foreign debt in the 8th senate explained thus why the 8th senate rejected general buhari s loan request we turned down the fg loan request for 30 billion to save nigeria from sinking into the dark gully of a perpetual debt trap we don t want our country to be recolonised by creditor banks our external debt in 2015 was 10 32 billion and it escalated to 22 08 in the second quarter of 2019 which is 114 per cent increase if we had approved that loan request our external debt could have catapulted to over 52 billion and that is not sustainable with the current escalation of borrowing we will be walking into debt slavery and move from landlords to tenants in our country they will always tell you that even america is borrowing and i don t know how rational is it to keep on borrowing because another country is borrowing if we keep listening to bankers and contractors we will keep borrowing and burying ourselves and leave behind for our children a legacy of debt burden loans are not charities most of those encouraging more borrowing are parasitic consultants commission agents rent seeking fronts and contractors but lawan by his body language and actions seems to be telling sani to keep his concerns to himself and that the new national assembly leadership is not interested in such monotonous epilogue advertisement closely following sani s submission is the guardian report which stated that with the fresh loan the yearly debt service provision in the budget would near n3 2 trillion with worsening budget deficit unless the revenue base increases significantly again the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci and the manufacturers association of nigeria man have also expressed concerns about the federal government s ability to service its debts they noted that in the 2020 budget of n10 5 trillion debt service commitment and recurrent spending are beginning to crowd out capital expenditure however the debt management office dmo the minister of finance zainab ahmed as well as other regime s obedient mouthpieces are performing economic gymnastics loudly trumpeting that the problem of nigeria is not debt but revenue and that the regime has increased vat to 7 5 and is also trying to widen the tax net i have serious reservations if all these measures will significantly raise the national revenue i fully align myself with those opposed to the loan if you are still in doubt as to the state of our economy read the economic report released in november by the central bank of nigeria cbn maybe the scales will fall from your eyes advertisement lawan and his fellow buccaneers have thrown caution to the wind as long as buhari is the one making the request it must be good for nigeria such shallow line of reasoning has brought upon us this dire straits of national regression nothing underscores the stark contradiction and the reality of the moment like a newspaper lead story recently while the national assembly approved a paltry n22 89 billion for the federal roads maintenance agency s capital expenditure in the 2020 budget it allocated n37 billion or over 100 million for the repair of the national assembly complex education and health got n48 billion and n46 billion respectively the complex was built in 1999 at a cost of nearly 35 18 million and the contract was awarded to itb nigeria on february 18 1996 at a time it was less than n100 to the dollar lawan and members of the national assembly want 100 million to renovate the complex that was built with 35 million at a time of serious revenue shortfall with the regime embarking on 30 billion borrowing binge at a time the regime is increasing the tax burden on its citizens to fill the revenue gap at a time nigeria is wearing the crown with the bold inscription the poverty capital of the world lawan and his colleagues are more interested in their comfort advertisement let somebody out there tell me this is not real well it is real somebody asked me if they want to pull the whole structure down and rebuild it from the scratch i answered no just renovation the amount is curious and looks like a settlement largesse to the lawmakers from the general and despite mounting public criticisms the leadership is unmoved and seems determined to enjoy the bonanza it is completely insane take a look at the budget for education and health and compare it with how much these people want to just renovate the national assembly complex with and you begin to understand the mentality of our leaders it is all about them their pockets their comfort and kickbacks their children don t attend public schools they school abroad they and their families don t patronise the local public health system they fly abroad to attend to their health needs so why should they care about allocating enough funds to public infrastructure a sparring partner asked rhetorically make no mistake i am not averse to the renovation of the national assembly complex if indeed it is in a sorry state of disrepair the issue is the strange amount involved there is a complete lack of transparency and the buhari regime and the national assembly are not doing much to provide clarity again the questions that have since cropped up are how did lawan and his fellow travellers in infamy arrive at the whopping n37 billion renovation cost who did the work evaluation and costing is this how they will just be bandying outlandish figures about cost of contracts after borrowing 30 billion from foreign sources some nigerians already have forebodings that like those debts that were paid off during the olusegun obasanjo presidency the country would not get value for the money advertisement the motivation of those pushing for the loan is not their love for nigeria nor is it provision of infrastructure it is all about what s in it for them sani s submission earlier referenced is instructive here that most of those encouraging more borrowing are parasitic consultants commission agents rent seeking fronts and contractors this lawless regime is walking nigeria into another debt trap an economic basket case
karachi foreign investment in government debt papers continued with the addition of over 400 million within a month the latest data issued by the state bank of pakistan sbp on friday shows that the treasury bills attracted 413m during a month which pushed the total foreign investment in government papers to 1 413 billion on november 25 the total inflow in the t bills was 1bn which has since jumped to 1 4bn reflecting the growing confidence of foreign investors these inflows in local debt papers support to some extent the government s claim that investment environment has improved prime minister imran khan has recently announced that 2020 will be the year of economic progress and stability around half a billion dollar investment in the equity market could not stay and the outflow of 542m practically reduced the overall inflows in t bills and equity during a month period the collective inflows were 1 956bn during the month this is the first time that pakistan has succeeded to attract such large foreign inflows in government papers which has affected other investment too for example the foreign direct investment during 5mfy20 surged by 78 per cent to 850m financial sector which has been investing heavily in government papers believes that the high returns on t bills were the main attraction for foreigners currently the returns on three six and 12 months t bills are 13 51pc 13 28pc and 13 24pc respectively however analysts believe the new direction of foreign investment was due to state bank s encouragement and marketing for the t bills which paid the returns a debate is going on among the financial and corporate sector regarding the policy interest rate which is the key attraction for foreign inflows in t bills the sbp has indicated that the interest may not be changed during this fiscal year due to high inflationary pressure in the economy the present interest rate which is at 13 25pc is being criticised by the business sector as it discourages investment in new ventures and expansions details show that the inflows in t bills are largely coming from two countries the united states and the united kingdom the investment from the uk was 720m while 621m came from the us the only other significant inflow amount was worth 48m from luxemburg published in dawn december 28th 2019
there may be three billionaires running for president but that hasn t stopped many democratic candidates from railing against the ultra wealthy especially massachusetts sen elizabeth warren coming together to create an economy a government an energy system that works for all of us not just the one percent vermont sen bernie sanders said at a campaign rally meanwhile warren is proposing sweeping cultural change and ambitious plans such as her 21 trillion dollar proposal for medicare for all that leaves more moderate competitors like minnesota sen amy klobuchar to question how she will pay for it in turn warren blasted her moderate democratic rivals seeking the white house accusing them of naively accepting republican calls for unity rather than standing up to the rich while too quickly bending to the whims of their own wealthy donors the massachusetts senator strongly defended her progressive vision for the nation built on using new taxes to extend benefits such as universal child care and health coverage warren didn t name former vice president joe biden or mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana but she was clearly taking aim at them suggesting that long simmering tensions between the party s centrist and progressives wings are boiling over unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not counting on republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big business accountability they have opposed under democratic presidents for a generation warren said during a speech at the new hampshire institute of politics unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if democrats adopt republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well connected will stand down related elizabeth warren health care plan pledges no middle class tax increase the cornerstone of warren s policy centers around a 2 cent wealth tax on those with fortunes over 50 million dollars which she claims will pay for things like the expansion of charter schools and free college for those who qualify well i don t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations i want one that works for our family warren told a cheering crowd at a campaign event and in order to pay for medicare for all warren proposes a 6 percent tax on anyone who s worth over a billion dollars and that has led to clear battle lines drawn between warren and those considered billionaires who argue the senator s plans are punitive and will dismantle their life s work while disincentivizing others who want to get rich one day she pledges to use that tax money to offer universal child care and wipe out most student debt for 42 million americans while helping finance a medicare for all plan providing government sponsored health care nationwide elizabeth warren is of course the person that wall street dislikes the most said hal dash a democratic strategist but warren is not backing down her latest campaign ad is aimed right at the uber wealthy you built it at least in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped paid the bill we re americans we want to make these investments all we re saying is when you make it big pitch in two cents warren said emphatically at a campaign rally she s even taken a swipe at billionaire democratic hopeful michael bloomberg a former new york city mayor i don t believe that elections ought to be for sale warren said in an appearance on bloomberg warren remains bunched near the top of the polls with biden buttigieg and sanders the race s other strong progressive voice but rather than contrasting herself with sanders to shore up the democratic left she has increasingly gone after the mayor and the former vice president as well as bloomberg the division is growing as the first votes of the democratic primary near and there s mounting concern that no clear front runner will emerge from the initial slate of contests nobody is perfect and nobody is pure and there s no question that any democrat running for president would be a whole lot better than donald trump warren said thursday to applause she added later but voters will not trust a candidate who won t make a single difficult decision that might cut down on the access and influence of wealthy donors and voters will be right in response to warren s speech buttigieg senior adviser lis smith suggested that the senator may ultimately undermine democratic unity sen warren s idea of how to defeat donald trump is to tell people who don t support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party smith said warren has centered her candidacy on proposing structural changes to remake the political and economic system but some potential hurdles of doing so were on display earlier this month when the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model which provides nonpartisan analysis of public policy proposals released findings showing that warren s wealth tax will raise 2 3 trillion to 2 7 trillion over 10 years that s as much as 1 4 trillion less than warren s campaign estimates the analysis also concluded that the new taxes would cause the economy to contract 0 9 percent to 2 1 percent by 2050 and says the new tax would reduce private capital formation enough to drive the u s economy s average wage down 0 9 percent to 2 3 percent even affecting households not rich enough to qualify for the tax warren s wealth tax has been among the most popular and most scrutinized proposals of her campaign although sanders has proposed an even higher tax on top fortunes warren s has given her an economic populist edge and even prompted crowds at her rallies to break into chants of 2 cents responding to the analysis after her new hampshire speech warren said it wasn t really based on what she wants to do saying the authors changed provisions and then analyzed something else i understand there are people who want to throw up a lot of dust around this because they don t really have any comeback to that central question and that is why aren t we asking the folks at the very top to pitch in a couple of cents so that we could actually invest in opportunity and everyone else she said still even warren herself acknowledged the potential difficulty of her agenda noting in her speech will i have a magic wand to enact my full agenda of course not no president does i know i will have to compromise but that s not where we start she said she d exploit senate procedures allowing some legislation to pass with a simple majority noting that republicans used that to pass the tax cuts championed by trump but pulling that off is difficult since the chamber rules would require near universal democratic unity the associated press contributed

the problems caused by a shrinking population are not a matter of opinion they can be observed in modern nations where the phenomenon is underway such as in japan as business insider reported last year japan s situation is dire the declining population there translates into an aging population which requires more spending on health care and more money for social programs but there are fewer young workers around to provide the tax dollars necessary to support those programs small towns and villages are dying if that situation hits the united states social security medicare and medicaid all would face crises of existential proportions the huge national debt now at 23 trillion and growing at a rate of 1 trillion a year would be impossible to retire companies would face declining revenues which would translate into declining salaries and unemployment the stock market would decline as equities and markets contract the normal transfer of wealth from one generation to the next in the form of real property and inheritances would be stymied there wouldn t be enough buyers around for all the houses on the market deflation would likely result universities would contract innovation would suffer urban decay would accelerate these are only some of the known results of a declining population which would be much worse than the long predicted but never realized results of overpopulation sure the population in the united states is still growing but that s deceptive the seeds of decline are being planted today the nation s birthrate has been below the replacement level long thought to be an average of 2 1 children per woman in childbearing age as the deseret news reported friday utah s birth rate also has fallen below this level nationally the trend covers all ethnicities generally birth rates decline during bad economic times and rebound during good times but that has not happened during the current boom as the deseret news reported the fertility rate seems to be stabilizing but it is stabilizing at a rate lower than replacement normally the united states could make up for this through immigration but two things are standing in the way of that one is a general anti immigration mood in washington the other is the fact that birth rates are declining in much of the world including countries normally known for high fertility rates bangladesh for instance had a birth rate of 6 82 in 1975 but that fell to 2 1 in 2016 demographers say a nation s population will continue to climb until the last generation that reproduced at a replacement level has died then the decline will begin in earnest few people who study such things question that this trend is underway vienna based demographer wolfgang lutz has predicted the decline will begin in about 2060 to 2070 understanding why this is happening is difficult a gallup poll in 2018 found that 41 of americans believe a family of three or more children is ideal gallup also has found people in the 18 40 age group expressing a desire to have children and yet people are not fulfilling their desires some countries such as denmark and singapore have launched public service campaigns aimed at urging young people to procreate the united states could adopt policies that promote families through tax breaks or other incentives it could launch public service campaigns the earlier awareness becomes widespread the greater the chances the trend can be reversed before it leads to economic catastrophe

in july 1987 a group of congressmen stood on the steps of the us capitol and took turns demolishing a toshiba portable radio with a sledgehammer in a much publicised gesture of furious frustration at what they considered to be japan s unfair competitive practices and its large and its stubborn bilateral trade surplus like china today japan then was the target of a us trade offensive aimed at thwarting its inroads into american markets and at removing its barriers to us exports and like president donald trump s recent provisional settlement of his trade war with beijing temporary truces were procured by periodic japanese agreement to buy more us goods and promises and to make often largely cosmetic policy changes then too the main battleground was high technology products such as microchips and computers in which japan had rapidly acquired formidable strength that seriously threatened us industrial dominance furthermore unlike china japan posed a growing challenge in other industries such as machine tools and cars at the expense of american competitors but the conflict was about far more than trade again just as with china today it was at root a battle between economic systems that pitted us free market capitalism against a japanese model that many americans saw as relying on massive state planning and intervention orchestrated by the ministry of international trade and industry a body to which many in the west attributed superhuman powers coupled with incestuous interlocking relationships that enabled companies to keep a largely closed domestic market to themselves a group of american authors known as revisionists argued in books and articles that the us could not compete with this system and that unless it found a way to fight back it would become a mere colony of japan their mood of near hysterical defeatism was captured in rising sun a best selling novel by michael crichton who wrote they haven t succeeded by doing things our way japan is not a western industrial state it is organized quite differently and the japanese have invented a new kind of trade adversarial trade trade like war trade intended to wipe out the competition which america has failed to understand for several decades nor were american fears of a japanese takeover confined to business and commerce they spilled over into the military sphere when it became known that the guidance systems of us cruise missiles relied on optical hardware produced in japan the flames were fanned by essays entitled the japan that can say no penned by the boss of sony and the right wing nationalist mayor of tokyo they argued that the us economy was gravely weakened by flaws in its corporate system and that japan should assert itself more vigorously and use its technological prowess as a weapon with which to contest american leadership just as with china today anguished american soul searching was fuelled by a widespread feeling that the us had been caught napping because of its own critical foreign policy failures and misjudgments in china s case the error was summed up in former president bill clinton s prediction that that as the country opened up and grew richer it would become more like us japan on the other hand had long been beholden to the suzerainty of the us which created its constitution and political system and to which tokyo had sub contracted its defence security and much of its foreign policy suddenly it seemed this once meekly obedient pupil was threatening to become america s master there was however an important difference between today s china bashers and the revisionists of the late 1980s the latter while decrying the threat they believed the japanese model posed also saw much to admire in it indeed they argued that if the us could not beat the japanese its only hope was to copy their way of doing things one american commentator a business school professor no less went so far as to propose that the us should create its own version of keiretsu japan s tightly knit financial and industrial conglomerates by engineering a merger between ibm citicorp and intel ironically just as the revisionists drum beating was reaching a peak of frenzy the japanese model was crumbling from within vertiginous debt serious capital misallocation excess investment and the popping of a huge property bubble triggered a balance sheet recession and a string of corporate casualties paving the way for persistent deflation and more than a lost decade of growth the us meanwhile staged a dramatic economic and industrial recovery many observers detect symptoms of japan s problems in china today as it struggles to deleverage an economy and financial system bloated by an orgy of borrowing and an overheated property market while preventing a further slowdown in economic growth that depends heavily on continuing injections of debt to keep going could it be that china will go the same way suffering a severe crash that ravages its economy and blunts its advances om global markets at the very moment when many in the west fear its industrial ascent to be unstoppable it is impossible to know though a number of commentators in china as well as in the west believe the risks of such an outcome are rising they should beware of what they wish for while japan s lost decade sent it into retreat on the world stage a serious reversal of fortunes in china seems unlikely to follow quite the same pattern the reason is that the chinese communist party s political legitimacy rests mainly on two legs delivering steady improvements in living standards to the mass of the people and maintaining popular support through nationalist drum beating when the party s capacity to achieve the former has been weakened it has often raised the volume of the latter and turned a more aggressive face to the world if that happened again china would be likely to become an even more difficult and unpredictable partner to deal with recent clashes over trade and industrial competition could prove to be only the prelude to far more turbulent times to come
by marc fouradoulas via mises in the face of illness and suffering private markets for healthcare services allegedly fail since the 1960s neoclassical economists have legitimized the regulation and collectivization of this sector under the term market failure this assumption forms the foundation of the discipline of health economics and its attempt to replace the failed market using econometrics in addition to widespread ethical principles such as equality of access and solidarity health economics legitimizes collectivist state intervention for the development maintenance and regulation of national healthcare systems the threat of government failure is to be averted by health policy interventions and health economic models and research health services research econometric cost benefit studies etc are supposed to inform these interventions health economists so called social engineers in line with politicians aim at technocratic management of healthcare systems and the associated political discourse the consequences are far reaching compulsory insurance price controls and third party financing of all services ultimately transform the entire sector into a bureaucratic form of economy characteristics of the healthcare sector healthcare systems are mass scale their development is unpredictable and their complexity unmanageable the abandonment of market mechanisms of price formation inevitably leads to misguided incentives rigid structures and bureaucratization instead of the spontaneous order of the market a chaotic web of unclear claims and quid pro quos emerges collectivist funding entails moral hazard and escalating costs followed by centralist attempts at control such as increasing regulation and arbitrary rationing health economic research aims at healthcare policy i e politicians and leaves a wide scope for special interest groups the attempts at political control inevitably take on planned economic characteristics depending on the system the role of the market is maintained in the residual form of so called regulated competition however regulated competition is not based on the willingness of patients to pay but on diagnoses diagnosis related groups and price controlled fees which must be financed by third party financiers i e by the collective as the number of providers increases an expansion of volume and a focus on lucrative service fees inevitably result from this distorted competition the discourse on system rescue conducted by stakeholder groups generally ends unproductively neither doctors insurers nor the general public have any interest in voluntarily deviating from their entitlements the scope of healthcare services unfortunately remains unclear the concept of illness itself is rarely defined also academic medicine with its biopsychosocial understanding of illness contributes little to this clarification since it remains vague about application and does not incorporate an economic dimension nevertheless political discussions are based on a sharp distinction between health and illness which is convenient if a diagnosis is present a so called effective expedient and economic treatment is legitimized the discussion is thereby shaped by an all or nothing thinking with diagnosis as the clear signpost economists prefer to cite examples of simple reparative interventions such as elective operations hysterectomy cataract surgery rare diseases orphan disease and excessively high drug prices public health experts refer to rough metric data such as mortality and satisfaction surveys to measure and legitimize the mass system unfortunately the view of the actual problems is lost an entitlement attitude to something that remains vague coupled with the problem that medicine as such is not an exact science what are healthcare services healthcare services are heterogeneous goods and services that are available in different quantities qualities and combinations they are not homogeneous and nobody consumes health services per se on the other hand there is an equally large variety of providers whose only common feature is a certificate from a university and a professional medical association both monopoly organizations doctors are anything but uniform one only needs to look at the growing range of specialist disciplines subdisciplines and special interest certificates what constitutes a doctor is not the result of market processes but a matter of academic and professional certification usually by licensing monopolies furthermore medical jargon and a guild like organization organized medicine obscure the actual background and conditions of these services since healthcare services are already in the hand of organized medicine the market is prone to fail instead of dealing with regulation and the right of equal access to this construct as a whole one would do better to focus should on specific services and needs themselves do services as diverse as ear rinsing kidney transplantation and psychotherapy actually have something in common that requires collective regulation and funding are they connected at all despite their appropriation by organized medicine a generalisation of these highly diverse services under the guise of market failure is hardly helpful after all the term healthcare service remains vague and refers to a variety of completely different services and products that depend upon different types of knowledge and degrees of skill the doctrine of market failure the american economist kenneth arrow first described market failure in relation to medical care in 1963 arrow himself was a representative and cofounder of the so called welfare economics and equilibrium theory equilibrium theory is based on the model of an ideal market which can function optimally and efficiently only if certain conditions exist the requisite conditions include the existence of perfect decision relevant information quality and price homogeneous goods consumer sovereignty lack of externalities and free market access if these conditions are met the market will be completely competitive with supply and demand reaching a competitive equilibrium it is a model that is based on mathematical derivations and leaves no room for the dynamic uncertain and ultimately entrepreneurial market process if these conditions are not present there is a market failure and this supposedly legitimizes the state intervention according to arrow and current health economic theory the conditions of the ideal market for health services and health insurance are not given uncertainties information asymmetries and supply side regulation are too great some of the specific sources of these characteristics are listed here for better understanding uncertainty regarding onset of disease coincidence and efficacy of therapy quality of diagnosis necessity of medical services patients can t know what they need extent of costs consequences of illness including impairment of the personal integrity of the affected and the potential loss of his decision making sovereignty and income opportunities information asymmetry the doctor s advantage in knowledge and experience expected behavior of the physician is affected by principal agent relationship the physician advises the patient and thus influences demand deviation from self interest and profit motive towards collective orientation treatment on the basis of objective parameters trust and relationship element no pretest of performance is possible supply side regulation licensing by universities and professional medical associations an austrian response from model to reality models are always abstract simplifications of reality scientifically this may be legitimate the benefit for the real world is the more relevant question however the equilibrium model is based on mathematical equations and does not take into account the complexities of human behaviour and environmental constraints similarly the entrepreneur as an actor in overcoming these obstacles is dismissed in reality markets are never perfect but are in a process of striving for an optimum equilibrium is a state but the market a process the question then is rather is the absence of a market i e a state organised healthcare system better than a market with uncertainties an all or nothing answer regarding the marketability of all healthcare services is hardly helpful further to question marketability in a state of high supply side regulation is comprehensible but the latter is a consequence of previous intervention rather than a cause of market failure we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us uncertainty and information asymmetry uncertainties and information asymmetries are givens in markets lawyers financial advisors and career advisors all operate with uncertainties and information asymmetries the client turns to them for lack of knowledge and experience in the case of perfect information and certainty such advisors as well as the doctor would be needless in order to prevent the abuse of power by the gradient in competence private markets allow for mediation through the obtention of second opinions the availability of information from consumer protection organizations and rating agencies or through guarantees in trust dependent professions reputation continues to play a central role uncertainties only become a problem when they entail high so called catastrophic costs such catastrophes cannot be predicted for the individual but in a large pool they can be statistically predicted which forms the basis of insurance shopping for medical services with uncertainty and information asymmetry is frowned upon the patient is supposed to be incompetent to decision making in that state still doctors use comparable standardized approaches to diagnose and treat illness hence the costs somewhat comparable what a patient needs is to some degree subject to a learning process similar to those that occur with the other purchases consumer sovereignty takes experience on the other hand a doctor who abuses his competence might risk his reputation with widespread information available nowadays it has become possible to compare diagnostic and therapy costs for moderate cases of illness is it unthinkable to privatize treatments such as iron deficiency wound treatment asthma or colds especially with recurring conditions it s hard to frown upon a responsible approach to private diagnostic services the embedding of all healthcare services in a third party financed healthcare system with exclusive handling by highly specialized mds the medical training takes at least twelve years in switzerland enforces a quality standard which is probably more luxurious than what a cost conscious consumer would opt for voluntarily arrow aptly described key elements of applied medicine but as with the idea of a perfect market the rationale he uses tends towards all or nothing thinking for every form of medical consultation there is such a gradient of knowledge skill and vulnerability that the patient always seems at the mercy of the doctor the patient is therefore always incapable never able to judge and always at risk due to illness he is apparently not in a position to acquire knowledge and experience and learn to make independent decisions on the other hand the physician is attributed a standardized medical competence but in reality there is no constant in that either apart from acute and distinct situations treatment styles can vary a lot the variety of medical special interest certificates is proof of this likewise the abandonment of the profit motive is an ideal typical conception which is not durable in reality also diseases are not always coincidental a large part of chronic diseases can be traced to unfavourable behaviour around 80 percent of direct healthcare costs in switzerland are caused by non communicable diseases ncds cardiovascular diseases diabetics cancer and respiratory and musculoskeletal diseases estimates suggest that more than half of ncds could be avoided or at least delayed with a healthy lifestyle chronically ill people therefore contribute in part to their diseases they are not just victims of chance hence the trade off in these cases is always individual e g lifestyle change or insurance funded drug in addition healthcare may cause illness opportunism or morbid gain in which people identify with illness and avoid responsibilities in such cases treatments even have an illness promoting effect would patients rather seek empowerment when they are biased by insurance related moral hazard or in a free market health literacy is the choice of the individual after all he is the expert on his perception and behaviour and in this regard exhibits asymmetric information vis à vis the doctor the characteristics of unambiguously limited decision making apply predominantly in acute illnesses and severe mental illnesses with a high degree of urgency unfortunately health economic theory utilizes these rather extreme cases and extrapolates them to analyze all healthcare services patients thus get the impression that they cannot become masters of their health this is tragic since they have a lifetime to learn and shop for the best options instead of becoming subjects of learned helplessness guided by the welfare state and organized medicine the behavior of the doctor the problem of uncertainty regarding the onset of disease and the effectiveness of therapies is a reality limited decision making sovereignty and personal vulnerability characterize the patient dealing with this is characteristic of the medical profession thus the physician advises the patient in his interest principal agent relationship and adheres to a profession specific medical ethic in his own interest this is precisely what distinguishes him from a salesman and is intended to prevent abuse of power however state licensing of the medical profession has made such a distinction needless trust no longer arises from ethical and thus economically appropriate action but from the passed state examination and subsequent professional certification the state subsidized certificate thus stands in for reputation the excessive length of training prescribed by the state and professional associations creates the impression of unattainable competence in the eyes of the patient the elimination of price differentiation through widespread price controls decouples quality from pricing detached from the willingness of patients to pay prices will always yield to highest quality e g specialist and academic certification thus competition happens only on a quality level and inevitably moves towards higher specialization the more proof of certification the higher the quality the gap between doctor and patient thus continues to widen for the patient however the significance of certificates is unclear and the certification system itself remains opaque as it does to many a doctor since the physician as a person of trust is concerned about his reputation he has hardly any incentives to abuse his power but if he is insulated from the patient s willingness to pay and becomes a monopolist through high barriers to entry such as compulsory licensing or insurance contracts the patient is truly at his mercy if the doctor mainly performs technical services financed by health insurance such as radiologists do the patient and society are at his mercy the abuse of power is perfected state examination has thus become a unique entry barrier to medical monopoly and prestige the temptation of medical prestige a monopoly position and income guarantee is reflected in the constantly increasing number of doctors it is no longer the merit to the patient that counts no by price and service regulation medicine was detached from merciful achievement only the right to preserve vested rights remains although technical progress has reduced uncertainties e g in the form of more precise diagnostic techniques technical examinations have remained in the hands of doctors the extent to which a doctor who only carries out technical examinations continues to be a doctor has never been questioned consequently since technical procedures are not property of organized medicine they may undergo a process of commodification leading to higher productivity and lower prices e g allergy testing is not a medical service but a technical procedure separate from the consultation of an md conclusion the idea of market failure originates in a highly abstract economic model the discrepancy between the model and the real world is too great to allow markets to work the assumptions it contains end up denying the marketability of all healthcare services in practice but isn t this discrepancy more a problem of the model than the real world looking closer at the specific assumptions of market failure theory we find errors such as all or nothing thinking overgeneralization vagueness and the confounding of cause and effect as in supply side regulation looking further at socialized medicine we find that the neoclassical market model is not very helpful in real life since bureaucratization of all healthcare services leads to a sluggish rigid mass scale system which cannot adapt to the needs of the patient and becomes subject to abuse by special interest groups furthermore the adherence to state subsidized licensing monopolies and the guild like structure of organized medicine cements patient dependencies and capitalizes on them in an unfavorable way omitting market failure doctrine and the preservation of vested rights leads us to the question of which services are marketable and how and where social welfare is appropriate the patient s maturity and ability to judge and take responsibility will play a greater role ultimately this assessment is a central task for physicians e g a psychotic patient certainly can t choose what s best for him a final answer to the question of marketability is therefore not possible from a praxeological point of view health is a desirable goal and a constant learning process the challenge therefore is always how to empower the patient and conceptualise medicine outside the structure of organized medicine
caracas venezuela ani camacho has watched her 5 year old son zabdiel battle cancer for years the despair briefly turned to hope when she learned last december that zabdiel was going to get a potentially life saving bone marrow transplant in italy a complex medical procedure he could not receive in venezuela we were super happy camacho said all the family had left to do was buy plane tickets and get visas she said but she and zabdiel never left venezuela because the program that would have allowed him to travel became enmeshed in the country s economic chaos and was put on hold they remain in caracas traveling back and forth between an apartment lent by a family member and j m de los ríos children s hospital where zabdiel has spent much of his life and made most of his friends it s so much anguish desperation impotence camacho 40 said as she waited for her husband to bring her son home from the hospital where the boy was getting a spinal tap we are out of options she said with venezuela in the grip of a severe economic crisis spanning several years children like zabdiel have been caught in the center as the humanitarian toll worsens with no immediate end in sight aid workers and doctors told nbc news the boy s struggle for medical care was emblematic of a broader crisis that was causing a generational toll as children continue to languish at key points in their mental and physical development janeth márquez director of the catholic aid organization cáritas in venezuela said the three biggest problems facing venezuela s children are an inability to get medical care or supplies malnutrition and the effect of families being separated as parents leave the country to find work to be able to send money back home about a third of the country s children need help accessing basic nutrition health and education services unicef said in june the united nations agency also said that mortality of children under 5 had increased by more than half from 2014 to 2017 zabdiel is among dozens of children at the hospital in need of bone marrow transplants hundreds of children and young people received the transplants and aftercare treatment in italy under a 2010 agreement that was financed by venezuela s state run oil company zabdiel camacho has spent much of his life at a hospital in caracas venezuela courtesy ani camacho but that program has been suspended four children whose families were also hoping for transplants died at the hospital in may another child on the list has died since then according to advocates venezuela s government claims u s sanctions have frozen funds that could have paid for the expensive medical treatments while critics of president nicolás maduro say it is another example that venezuela s medical system is in turmoil amid mismanagement and corruption camacho said the children have been caught in the middle with their lives at stake they are the most affected by this situation she said my son doesn t know anything about this but he is in a fight and a war we would collapse on a wednesday in june a line of people mostly women holding babies and young children stretched out the door of the emergency medical clinic that cáritas runs for families in need some were there to see an on site pediatrician others because they were sick and needed treatment or medications they could not otherwise afford márquez said there has been a sharp increase in people needing their services since 2014 when only about 10 people would come to their main offices now hundreds of people come every day including an influx of middle class people seeking medicine they can no longer afford or that is not available otherwise auribel plazuela 31 arrived at the clinic that morning for a follow up appointment for her 9 month old daughter and to receive asthma treatment for herself plazuela said that about two months earlier her baby appeared weak and was coughing and coughing so she brought her to the clinic where she was given medication along with a treatment plan i completed the treatment and thank god the baby hasn t suffered any more she said as other children cried while being seen by a pediatrician at the same time a little girl in a pink and white top and shorts was given an injection to treat nausea and vomiting it s truly very difficult people come here every day that truly need this plazuela said in other hospitals it s very difficult because you have to pay and with the situation the way it is now you can t plazuela said she has asthma and had been having trouble breathing for the last three days so she came to cáritas and waited to receive a nebulizer treatment she said she brought her daughter in again for a check up and the doctor found her to be in good health plazuela said she knew other parents of children with special needs such as epilepsy who went to the clinic because they needed very expensive medication without the services the clinic provides we would collapse she said all of us venezuelans are going through the same thing she said you buy one thing or the other i buy food or i buy medicine and in the end i need both this crisis is taking children the government s data from 2016 shows that maternal mortality shot up 65 percent in one year infant mortality rose by 30 percent to more than 11 000 babies under the age of 1 dying in that single year márquez said her organization works with communities who have faced an onslaught by the crisis in venezuela and has seen the toll it has on families sadly we are seeing how this crisis is taking children she said if the crisis continues we are looking at a dark horizon for people who do not have money for the most vulnerable she said maduro s critics say his government is to blame for the country s woes and the escalating collapse of the economy under his presidency through mismanagement and corruption while maduro has long claimed harsh u s sanctions are ravaging the economy carlos 30 sits on a pile of trash where he looks for food in caracas on april 10 2019 eva marie uzcategui getty images in 2018 venezuela s inflation rate rose to 130 060 percent according to the government s data in the third quarter of 2018 the country s gdp shrank 22 5 percent over the prior year maduro who took power in 2013 as the heir to president hugo chávez remains in office despite opposition leader juan guaidó s call for mass demonstrations and a military uprising at the end of april but mass defections never materialized and much of the military has remained loyal to maduro guaidó declared himself venezuela s interim president in late january after maduro s disputed re election last year more than 50 countries including the united states recognize guaidó as the country s interim leader this hurts the children the most dr julio castro who works at the central university of venezuela said a major contributing factor to health issues in venezuela was the lack of consistent access to clean safe drinking water which has led to outbreaks of diseases including hepatitis a tap water is not considered safe to drink and most people who can afford to do so boil the water or buy packaged bottles even in caracas the capital some people do not have running water every day he said while others store water in tanks that can become breeding grounds for mosquito borne diseases or drink from polluted rivers or lakes plazuela said that while she has a water tank sometimes the water comes out yellow or dirty so she always boils the water for herself and her four children márquez said cáritas latest study found that 35 percent of children were suffering from chronic malnutrition living with nutritional deficiencies for at least five years in 2017 that number was 27 percent according to cáritas in a statement to united nations human rights chief michelle bachelet cáritas highlighted several critical issues including delays in growth because of chronic malnutrition the charity said it had evaluated more than 30 000 children in the last three years and found that 6 out of 10 families interviewed are begging and searching for food in garbage dumps four in 10 have had to sell belongings to afford food and another four in 10 have had to separate as a family to continue surviving cáritas said the united nations said in june that more than 4 million migrants and refugees have left venezuela in the last few years the pace of migration has skyrocketed since the end of 2015 the u n said with the number increasing by a million in seven months from last november to june globally venezuelans are one of the single largest population groups displaced from their country the international organization for migration and u n refugee agency said in a statement márquez said that cáritas great concern is that emigration continues to increase this year which totally destroys the family destroying homes we say we have mothers who don t have children and children who don t have mothers she said cáritas runs a weekly soup kitchen which drew a hundred people on a recent day a priest led the group in prayer and volunteers passed out bread and bowls of soup containing beef potatoes corn carrots onions and lentils workers said it was the only time many of the families ate protein during the week residents collect water released through a pipe in an abandoned construction site which contains chemicals products in caracas on april 4 2019 roman camacho sopa images lightrocket via getty images ana rojo had some soup while holding her 1 year old son at a table surrounded by other family members as a mother of 12 children rojo said the soup kitchen was essential for her family many venezuelans including rojo s family rely on a government subsidized food aid program but the aid only lasts her family a few days she said rojo said sometimes she would just start to cry because she would have to send her kids to bed hungry you send them to bed with just a glass of water and that s not fair to them she said rojo said her 5 year old son sometimes faints and turns purple he starts to vomit because he hasn t eaten this hurts the children the most she said because you re an adult and you endure but they don t the situation is getting worse every day dr castro said the country s continuing hyperinflation has worsened health issues for families it s impossible for them to afford medicine for any diseases he said hospitals throughout the country also do not have the medicine they need or water on an everyday basis some have problems with electricity he said my concern is that the situation is getting worse every day castro said rosa colina whose daughter cristina 18 is also in need of a bone marrow transplant described being in hospitals lacking medicine sometimes when medication was available she had to pay for it out of pocket expenses she cannot afford cristina suffers from a blood disorder called thalassemia major and developed hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in 2016 colina said she has had to go out in the street and beg for money in the hope of being able to afford medication cristina colina suffers from a blood disorder called thalassemia major and developed hepatitis c after a blood transfusion in 2016 courtesy rosa colina the hospitalizations and increasing health complications have taken over cristina s daily life a year ago she required a wheelchair following the development of a blood clot and while she has since regained some mobility her parents need to physically help her get around before 2016 cristina was a model but not anymore she used to play violin she left that too her mom said through tears colina said she hopes a transplant could give cristina a chance at a normal life and to accomplish the goals she has held for so much of her young life some 500 bone marrow transplants for adults and children have been done in the country at a hospital in caracas and at another in the city of valencia since 2000 said dr francisco ramírez director of the bone marrow transplant program at the hospital of clinics caracas but in the last two years the number of transplants has decreased from about 25 a year to nine last year and three so far this year he said this is mainly due to the difficulty in getting medications of getting what corresponds to the costs he said beyond the limited resources children like zabdiel who do not have a matching donor in venezuela have had to look internationally for potential matches and transplant treatments as venezuela currently does not have the methodology or ability to take bone marrow matches from international sources and bring them to venezuela to treat the children he said the country and aid organizations are looking into other ways to give transplants to children like zabdiel but limited resources are again a major issue he said maduro s government has said coercive measures by the u s government in the form of sanctions have prevented the state run oil company pdvsa from transferring money for the transplant treatments venezuela sent the funds through pdvsa and they were retained in novo banco portugal thanks to the sanctions and the criminal blockade venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza said in a statement in april while the u s government maintains the pdvsa citgo blockade in venezuela the lists of citizens who hope to benefit from the social health program grow he added referring to the u s subsidiary of pdvsa enrica giavatto director of the association for bone marrow transplant said since 2006 the organization has brought 487 venezuelans most of them women and young people to italy pdvsa had initially been covering the cost of transplants she said in june 2018 the group received funding related to the last two months of 2018 but since then they have not received any additional payments giavatto said she said the association has not been paid costs related to the transplants and after care treatment for all of 2018 and 2019 the group has continued to provide care for the 19 children and adults who are in italy receiving treatment as part of the program she said giavatto said that because italy s hospitals are public and because of the high debts owed because of the lack of payment the association is not able to take more patients including zabdiel she added that the venezuelan government did try to make a bank transfer of more than 4 million euros to the association but that was stopped by portuguese bank novo banco she said venezuela asked the group to then open a bank account in russia to bypass the sanctions she said the group did but has not heard an answer novo banco did not immediately respond to a request for comment katherine martínez director of prepara familia a nongovernmental humanitarian organization has been advocating for the families and said the venezuelan government has the duty to find other sources of funding for the transplants we re talking about the lives of children that are very much at risk she said these are families that are doing all they can back at the apartment in caracas where camacho lives the door opened and zabdiel arrived home accompanied by his father leonardo amaya the boy was dressed in a white button down shirt and gray corduroy pants a white bandage around his right wrist he played with brightly colored toy cars that he had separated into groups of autobots and decepticons dueling factions from the transformers series after a relapse in 2018 zabdiel is receiving maintenance treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that includes daily medication chemotherapy and lumbar punctures his mother said camacho described zabdiel as a loving and happy child throughout their struggles family photos showed the boy dressed as superman in one he wears a superman t shirt and cape a mask covering his mouth with his right hand bandaged in another he wears a superman hoodie his mouth again covered with a mask giving a thumbs up to the camera as their wait continues camacho said she lives in fear that my son will die waiting for a transplant i am afraid that we will have to give up our dreams for our son she said
in the last century the democratic party was known as the party of liberals but a staunch opponent of socialists and communists no more radicals have taken over the party and called for policies that would make karl marx smile sen bernie sanders i vt proudly calls himself a socialist as he campaigns for the democratic presidential nomination fellow socialist sen elizabeth warren d mass also seeks the democratic nomination while pretending she is a capitalist just as she pretended for years that she was a native american justin haskins elizabeth warren is pretending to be something she s not let s not fall for her masquerade there are plenty of reasons to believe that president trump will be reelected in 2020 and that republicans will hold onto their senate majority and gain house seats but anything can happen in politics so supporters of individual liberty and free markets need to be armed with as much information as possible to refute the far left campaign rhetoric democratic candidates are engaging in socialists are clever marketers they pitch their proposals as necessary to advance justice equality prosperity and the very survival of life on earth in the face of impending environmental disaster none of these things are true but they sound good and have a certain appeal the following are the three most potentially destructive proposals promoted by many of the leading democrats as well as important information you need to know about the dangers of these policies the green new deal the green new deal is the most dangerous and socialistic policy ever embraced by a major political party in american history in addition to completely eliminating the fossil fuel industry destroying millions of jobs in the process the green new deal would also require that everyone replace their gasoline and diesel powered cars tractors and trucks with electric vehicles mandate every home and commercial and industrial building in america be upgraded by the federal government to comply with extreme new environmental regulations and could even phase out air travel the green new deal would also force all americans to buy more expensive wind and solar energy and create massive energy shortages and power outages that would cripple our economy and leave many of us quite literally in the dark the green new deal would also impose a long list of socialist programs that have nothing to do with the alleged purpose of the plan stopping climate change these include creating a free college program a federal jobs guarantee a program providing universal access to healthy foods and a whole new system of publicly owned banks among many other provisions the american action forum estimates these policies could cost more than 90 trillion over their first 10 years about four times the current national debt if you asked our foreign enemies to come up with a plan to destroy the american economy and plunge our country into another great depression they couldn t come up with anything that would do the job as well as the green new deal in addition the green new deal would directly or indirectly put the federal government in charge of virtually every aspect of our lives but there are a few inconvenient truths that socialists like warren sanders and the queen of climate alarmism rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y don t want you to know first even if you believe humans are entirely responsible for climate change and there are many scientists who say we aren t nothing we do in the united states will stop global carbon dioxide emissions from rising in the coming decades if americans were to do exactly what green new deal supporters have called for committing economic suicide in the process increased carbon dioxide emissions in growing countries like china and india will push total emissions well beyond their current levels this is because less than 5 percent of the world s population lives in the united states in fact in 2018 and 2019 alone china increased its coal power capacity by enough to provide electricity to more than 31 million homes and experts now say china s current efforts to build new or revive existing coal power plants will soon surpass the entire coal generating capacity of the european union even more importantly the provisions of the green new deal would cause immense environmental harm for example because wind and solar facilities consume significantly more land than nuclear or natural gas plants running america on these renewables would require destroying at minimum tens of millions of acres of land animals and animal habitats and this doesn t even include the land needed to mine the massive amount of natural resources required for billions of new wind turbines and solar panels if you asked our foreign enemies to come up with a plan to destroy the american economy and plunge our country into another great depression they couldn t come up with anything that would do the job as well as the green new deal despite all this environmental damage the green new deal has been backed by many of the leading democratic party presidential candidates including warren and sanders modified versions have been proposed by every other leading candidate a just society although ocasio cortez s green new deal received more attention this year than just about any other democratic party proposal the long term impacts of her just society plan could be even worse the just society is a package of radical bills that have been endorsed by many of the leaders of the democratic party among other things it would prevent government agencies from denying access to any federal program on the basis of a prior criminal conviction or immigration status this means that millions of people now in america illegally would be eligible for countless social welfare programs and government aid costing untold billions of dollars every year even more troubling however is that the just society would redefine the meaning of poverty dramatically increasing the number of people eligible for social welfare programs like medicaid and food stamps medicare for all at the top of many progressives and socialists wish list for 2020 is the creation of a national single payer health care program not every democratic party presidential candidate supports immediately forcing the roughly 150 million people who are currently enrolled in private health insurance plans out of those plans and into a government run program but all of them have at the very least said they support a public option that would over time end up having the same effect there s no denying that the current health insurance system is a mess but putting government in charge of americans health care would be catastrophic every medicare for all plan now being proposed would mandate sharp cuts to the payment rates provided to health care providers that would drive up wait times increasing pain and suffering and resulting in the deaths of some patients who would have otherwise found necessary care click here to sign up for our opinion newsletter importantly democrats have absolutely no plans for expanding the supply of doctors hospitals and other health care professionals all while calling for providing tens of millions of additional americans with access to specialty health care services the cost of a national single payer health care plan has been hotly debated but most experts believe it would require at least 32 trillion in additional federal spending over the first decade it s likely that the real estimate is closer to 36 trillion of course democrats have absolutely no way to pay for medicare for all at least not without huge tax increases on the middle class and far more rationing and they have no way to pay for their just society or green new deal proposals either this is an especially important point considering the united states is already running trillion dollar deficits click here to get the fox news app if socialists and progressives have it their way the 2020 elections will force america down the road to economic and societal ruin our children and grandchildren would be saddled with tens of trillions of dollars of debt they won t be able to pay back and our highly dysfunctional federal government would be granted the authority to control our lives from the womb to the tomb the stakes couldn t be higher click here to read more by justin haskins

get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview as this decade comes to an end it s imperative that we reflect on the growing power of unions across the country according to gallup union approval is at a near 50 year high with 64 of americans approving of labor unions that more than half of the country approves of unions not only signals organized labor s enduring strength but also highlights growing public recognition that we need unions today more than ever this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now have an account log in the united automobile workers uaw strike of general motors one of the most successful union movements of the year is evidence that workers can leverage increased strength through unions the successful strike showed many across the country that joining unions and demanding essential benefits like healthcare and higher wages is well worth the fight the 40 day strike which started mid september by roughly 50 000 members of uaw working at general motors was about much more than corporate profits and stable jobs that can support families advertisement it was about the right to affordable healthcare the ways that trump continues to tilt the economy in favor of corporations and billionaires at the expense of working americans and the significance of unions and collective action and for that reason every person in the country should pay attention to the lessons of the strike as we head into a new decade of labor fights gm was doing its best to slim down healthcare benefits for the last three years gm s profits have soared the company has made 35 billion in profits since 2015 but the benefit of those profits haven t extended far beyond their corporate executives and shareholders indeed as part of the negotiations with uaw gm tried to force workers to pay 500 more for their healthcare a move that was ultimately turned back by the union a decade ago american workers helped bail out the big three automakers gm ford and chrysler losing 11 2 billion in the process to save an industry that employs millions then the 2017 republican tax plan gifted gm another 157 million in tax breaks in 2018 alone instead of investing those tax savings back into the jobs that american tax dollars worked to salvage in 2009 gm announced it was laying off 14 000 workers right before the holidays in 2018 advertisement at the same time instead of providing better benefits or pay raises to its workers the company spent roughly 100 million to buy back gm s own shares after gm workers went on strike calling for fair wages job security and rejecting the 500 increase to their healthcare costs the corporation initially dropped the workers healthcare altogether and with no warning while gm restored their coverage during the strike the company s shameful action put worker s healthcare at risk related stories in nashville the wife of a gm worker woke up after surgery to find out that her healthcare had been canceled while she was being operated on gm s decision to reinstate healthcare was likely motivated more by public pressure and the company s concern for its reputation bottom line rather than with workers health or well being advertisement gm s attempts to slice healthcare mirrors trump s actions gm s attempts to make their healthcare plans less affordable were abhorrent but not surprising given what we ve seen from washington under president donald trump s leadership after all the president s first priority when he got elected was to take healthcare from millions of people by repealing the affordable care act aca by including the repeal of the aca s individual mandate in their 2017 tax reform bill republicans guaranteed that their tax bill would result in more people without health insurance and increase the cost of coverage for millions of americans this provision of the tax law gave trump and the gop an opportunity to take the aca which the supreme court had already ruled constitutional back to the courts with the texas v united states case if courts rule in the republicans favor the aca and its coverage protection for people living with pre existing conditions would be overturned possibly leaving as many as 20 million more americans without healthcare the aca increased taxes on the wealthy and corporations to provide coverage and lower costs for low and moderate income americans striking the law would shift billions back to rich annually including 45 billion to households making over 250 000 a year and 34 billion to households making over 1 million yearly advertisement during debate over the republican tax bill we heard members of congress argue that their tax plan would help american workers and protect their jobs but what s happening today at gm makes it clear once again that corporations millionaires and billionaires are the only ones benefiting trump touted the new law again and again as economic stimulus for the working class but so far the average workers bonus from the bill has been 1 cent while the cost of groceries rent and healthcare keep going up the gm strike is a lesson for the rest of america from ceaseless attacks on affordable healthcare to stagnant wages and corporate tax giveaways the trump economy hasn t changed workers lives for the better that s why the uaw s strike against gm isn t just about their members it was a model for how all americans have to confront corporate power to ensure every family in the country can make a living and get affordable health care advertisement the gm workers fight for better healthcare matters to every single american they are an example of how we together we can successfully take on the corporate callousness and greed that trump and republicans have only further enabled in order to protect our families and improve our jobs all americans need to stand with them and say no to hikes in healthcare costs whether at their own job or in response to the trump administration s actions this fight was about more than gm it was about the kind of country we want to live in and whom we prioritize a handful of corporate executives and shareholders or thousands of rank and file workers like the recent strikes we ve seen from teachers and telecommunications workers this one affirmed a lesson that unions have conveyed time and time again when workers unite and fight for the benefits and fair treatment they deserve they can win margarida jorge is the executive director of health care for america now hcan the national grassroots coalition that from 2008 2013 ran a campaign to pass protect and promote the affordable care act aca
the perspective atlanta georgia december 5 2019 disclose bank balances of state owned entities president george weah government should not only count liberian currency and investigate large withdrawals of banknotes in 2018 and 2019 also his administration should disclose cash balances of state owned entities lec npa lprc nasscorp maritime etc for example his government should verify why cash balance owned by state owned entities at the central bank of liberia cbl decreased to l 6 7 million in 2018 from l 1 5 billion in 2017 as per page 65 of the cbl 2018 audited financial statements or should the public not know if the national social security corporation naascorp deposits cash at the central bank of liberia including the 1 1m investment income it earned in 2014 naascorp web site reported that it earned 1 1m from investment portfolios in 2014 state owned entities have not published their annual reports since 2014 disclose revenue collection additionally the government should disclose the revenue collected and how much it has allocated for wage bills for example the us 296m appropriated in the 2019 2020 budget messages from government are confusing the public for instance on the one hand the liberian revenue authority continues to state that it is collecting more revenue than projected and on the other hand officials at finance are complaining that the government is not paying wages because the country has no money so please count our revenue how did the custodian of imf l 13 9b become the owner if custody is not equivalent to ownership how did the central bank of liberia cbl become the owner of l 13 9b i e special drawing rights given to liberia imf lent to liberia cbl the custodian of liberia s money including tax revenue loan proceeds treasury bills etc added as part of cbl s l 71b accounts receivable the imf s l 13 9b according to page 67 of the 2018 audited financial statements so cbl s accounts receivable is overstated please provide liberia s cash balances at foreign banks cbl 2018 audited financial statements did not provide any information for example using the double entry accounting to record the increase in cbl s cash of l 4 9b in 2018 and l 7b in 2017 generally accepted accounting principles require accountants to record the business transaction on the left side i e as debit and on the right side i e as credit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles it is true that officials recorded the debit side and increased cash but why it did not identify the item that should have been credit moreover officials stated that the cash increase because of the effect on exchange rate fluctuations according to page 13 of the audited financial statements generated the additional cash yet cbl officials did not disclose what services and or products that it sold for cash i e operating cash which assets i e investing cash it sold and total cash it received i e financing cash from the sales of bonds stocks shares okay cbl officials might have assumed that liberia would pay its l 71b debt owed to cbl on 12 31 2018 not only will liberia pay its debt but liberia would pay the l 71b deb in us currency and since liberia s currency has depreciated from l 124 45 at 1 1 2018 to l 157 58 at 12 31 2018 cbl will get additional cash from the liberian government food production in liberia to close part ii let us visit the frontpageafrica story called big agriculture economic transformation projects in that article the writer stated that mr pierre frank laporte the new regional country director of the world bank paid a courtesy call upon president george weah and promised that the world bank is prepared to do big projects especially agriculture i like the agricultural idea and here are a few observations serve local food at government s ceremonies which might increase production the liberian government should study and adopt a policy if not available requiring ministries and agencies to serve cassava potato etc at government s functions this initiative might encourage the public to consume more and by extension increase the consumption of local food county agricultural competition the government should establish if not available a county agricultural competition to encourage liberians to increase food production the government should investigate prior agricultural programs the government should investigate pre 1980 policies of the agricultural development bank and review reasons if any why many entrepreneurs do not borrow money to produce food for example commercial banks appropriated l 72b loan for entrepreneurs in 2018 and cbl allocated us 5m agricultural in 2018 world bank will any money lending institution invest in food production since rice production does not generate quick and reasonable interest income the world bank 2017 balance sheet indicated that out of the us 330b of its total assets 172 countries own less than 10 of the total assets dr jim kim former president of the world bank the lower amount allocated for food production did not discourage dr jim kim the former president of the world bank that mr barack obama former president of the united states appointed to lead the bank he had envisioned a world with a fewer hungry children which would enhance healthy and productive students his subordinates at the bank did not think so the foreign policy magazine in reporting numerous criticism against dr kim carried the article called is jim kim destroying the world bank or saving it from itself in that article mr jean louis sarbib speaking about president kim s views on food production stated that i don t think that he understands that the world bank is not a very large ngo adding mr sarbib stated that bureaucrats at the bank wanted income generating projects and not poor people s food production projects it could be true that the world bank is ready to assist poor countries however now that liberia s debt is around us 1b liberia should be careful in obtaining additional debt why did i say so well the interest of money lending international institutions might not be ours
united nations secretary general antonio guterres attends a press conference the former prime minister of portugal is an outspoken advocate of blockchain and has set up his office to help oversee its internal development antonio masiello getty images united nations secretary general antónio guterres says the intergovernmental giant needs to embrace blockchain in a statement provided to forbes by the secretary general s office guterres touted the technology first made popular by bitcoin as a crucial component of the organization that generates 50 billion in revenue annually coming at a time when the president of china has touted blockchain as a national priority and the 6 billion united nations children s fund has started accepting bitcoin and ethereum donations for some of its projects the statement from guterres shows that cryptocurrency and the underlying blockchain technology is being seriously explored at the highest levels of the largest organizations in the world while china seems largely focused on using blockchain as a way to prevent money laundering and better track its citizens transactions the united nations work has been more focused on giving donors increased assurance their donations are being spent how they wish while reducing waste in the organization s giant supply chain for the united nations to deliver better on our mandate in the digital age we need to embrace technologies like blockchain that can help accelerate the achievement of sustainable development goals said guterres in the statement provided exclusively to forbes in october guterres presented a united nations budget to the national committee for the first time in 45 years among the 2 87 billion set aside for 2020 was an additional 3 3 million about a 10 percent increase over last year for the sustainable development goals sdgs and other technical projects that required inter agency cooperation this isn t the first time guterres prominently mentioned blockchain in september 2018 he gave a speech in english spanish and french on the global lack of trust or what he called a trust deficit disorder that could in part be solved by blockchain with support from artificial intelligence and other technologies to help shine a light on the inner operations of global organizations in that speech given at the united nations general assembly in new york guterres warned about the potential misuse of near anonymous cryptocurrency payments even as he touted the potential of blockchain to achieve the sdgs first set in 2015 the 17 sdgs including ending poverty and responsibly producing and consuming goods are expected to be completed in the 2030s there are five blockchain projects in the united nations innovation network set up to facilitate inter agency cooperation for example the united nations international telecommunications union and food and agriculture organization have partnered to track pig supply chains in papua new guinea the united nations capital development fund is exploring blockchain for remittances in nepal and the united nations development programme is using blockchain to track the cocoa supply chain in ecuador according to the site in october 2019 unicef received its first bitcoin and ethereum donations from the ethereum foundation with the expressed purpose of using the cryptocurrency to fund international startups using blockchain to solve problems that support united nations initiatives at launch unicef usa unicef france unicef australia and unicef new zealand had joined the project which is now being explored by other national offices click here to learn more about the next blockchain 50 list of billion dollar companies using blockchain the difficulty for an organization the size of the un to accept cryptocurrency and build other applications with blockchain cannot be overstated it took years for unicef to get sign off from dozens of internal stakeholders just to accept cryptocurrency donations all for the potential benefit that anyone anywhere in the world could give or receive the same asset other blockchain applications which promise to reduce waste and redundancy between the un s occasionally competing agencies and give donors increased trust that the funds they donated were appropriately spent could take even longer to build research firm gartner predicts that 90 of blockchain projects will fail in the next three years while secretary general guterres doesn t have direct contact with the un s blockchain projects he is in a way behind all of them in september 2018 the former prime minister of portugal and chair of the parliamentary committee for economy finance and planning published a 20 page strategic plan for using technology to accomplish the sustainable development goals in which he explicitly called for further support of the innovation network s use of blockchain and artificial intelligence in the plan called the un secretary general s strategy on new technologies guterres placed the responsibility for the coordination and implementation of the plan within his own executive office with the support of a new technology reference group initiating quarterly meetings to provide him updates on the progress as we learn what is working and what is not he wrote we will revisit the strategy and update it ensuring its relevance to support a culture of innovation and that our global efforts are benefiting from experiences at the country and regional levels

there may be three billionaires running for president but that hasn t stopped many democratic candidates from railing against the ultra wealthy especially massachusetts sen elizabeth warren coming together to create an economy a government an energy system that works for all of us not just the one percent vermont sen bernie sanders said at a campaign rally meanwhile warren is proposing sweeping cultural change and ambitious plans such as her 21 trillion dollar proposal for medicare for all that leaves more moderate competitors like minnesota sen amy klobuchar to question how she will pay for it in turn warren blasted her moderate democratic rivals seeking the white house accusing them of naively accepting republican calls for unity rather than standing up to the rich while too quickly bending to the whims of their own wealthy donors the massachusetts senator strongly defended her progressive vision for the nation built on using new taxes to extend benefits such as universal child care and health coverage warren didn t name former vice president joe biden or mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana but she was clearly taking aim at them suggesting that long simmering tensions between the party s centrist and progressives wings are boiling over unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not counting on republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big business accountability they have opposed under democratic presidents for a generation warren said during a speech at the new hampshire institute of politics unlike some candidates for the democratic nomination i m not betting my agenda on the naive hope that if democrats adopt republican critiques of progressive policies or make vague calls for unity that somehow the wealthy and well connected will stand down related elizabeth warren health care plan pledges no middle class tax increase the cornerstone of warren s policy centers around a 2 cent wealth tax on those with fortunes over 50 million dollars which she claims will pay for things like the expansion of charter schools and free college for those who qualify well i don t want a government that works for giant multinational corporations i want one that works for our family warren told a cheering crowd at a campaign event and in order to pay for medicare for all warren proposes a 6 percent tax on anyone who s worth over a billion dollars and that has led to clear battle lines drawn between warren and those considered billionaires who argue the senator s plans are punitive and will dismantle their life s work while disincentivizing others who want to get rich one day she pledges to use that tax money to offer universal child care and wipe out most student debt for 42 million americans while helping finance a medicare for all plan providing government sponsored health care nationwide elizabeth warren is of course the person that wall street dislikes the most said hal dash a democratic strategist but warren is not backing down her latest campaign ad is aimed right at the uber wealthy you built it at least in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped paid the bill we re americans we want to make these investments all we re saying is when you make it big pitch in two cents warren said emphatically at a campaign rally she s even taken a swipe at billionaire democratic hopeful michael bloomberg a former new york city mayor i don t believe that elections ought to be for sale warren said in an appearance on bloomberg warren remains bunched near the top of the polls with biden buttigieg and sanders the race s other strong progressive voice but rather than contrasting herself with sanders to shore up the democratic left she has increasingly gone after the mayor and the former vice president as well as bloomberg the division is growing as the first votes of the democratic primary near and there s mounting concern that no clear front runner will emerge from the initial slate of contests nobody is perfect and nobody is pure and there s no question that any democrat running for president would be a whole lot better than donald trump warren said thursday to applause she added later but voters will not trust a candidate who won t make a single difficult decision that might cut down on the access and influence of wealthy donors and voters will be right in response to warren s speech buttigieg senior adviser lis smith suggested that the senator may ultimately undermine democratic unity sen warren s idea of how to defeat donald trump is to tell people who don t support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party smith said warren has centered her candidacy on proposing structural changes to remake the political and economic system but some potential hurdles of doing so were on display earlier this month when the university of pennsylvania s penn wharton budget model which provides nonpartisan analysis of public policy proposals released findings showing that warren s wealth tax will raise 2 3 trillion to 2 7 trillion over 10 years that s as much as 1 4 trillion less than warren s campaign estimates the analysis also concluded that the new taxes would cause the economy to contract 0 9 percent to 2 1 percent by 2050 and says the new tax would reduce private capital formation enough to drive the u s economy s average wage down 0 9 percent to 2 3 percent even affecting households not rich enough to qualify for the tax warren s wealth tax has been among the most popular and most scrutinized proposals of her campaign although sanders has proposed an even higher tax on top fortunes warren s has given her an economic populist edge and even prompted crowds at her rallies to break into chants of 2 cents responding to the analysis after her new hampshire speech warren said it wasn t really based on what she wants to do saying the authors changed provisions and then analyzed something else i understand there are people who want to throw up a lot of dust around this because they don t really have any comeback to that central question and that is why aren t we asking the folks at the very top to pitch in a couple of cents so that we could actually invest in opportunity and everyone else she said still even warren herself acknowledged the potential difficulty of her agenda noting in her speech will i have a magic wand to enact my full agenda of course not no president does i know i will have to compromise but that s not where we start she said she d exploit senate procedures allowing some legislation to pass with a simple majority noting that republicans used that to pass the tax cuts championed by trump but pulling that off is difficult since the chamber rules would require near universal democratic unity the associated press contributed

new homes sales slow and steady improvement for new homes continues as sales in november came in at an annualized rate of 719 000 which was up 1 3 from a downwardly revised 710 000 in october this places new home sales up 16 9 over the past year sales prices have risen to the point that they are probably starting to crimp sales the median price of a new home is up 7 2 over the past year to 330 800 the continued improvement in new homes sales suggests that the economy is not at risk of recession at any point in the immediate future the decline in mortgage rates by 110 basis points since peaking in november 2018 has been another important factor propelling sales sales in all of 2019 are on pace to exceed sales in 2018 by 10 durable goods orders ugly it was thought that the october report had reversed prior weakness but the 0 6 increase was revised down to just 0 2 and the number ex transportation was revised down from 0 6 to 0 3 worse yet novemberâ s expected 1 5 increase was a decline of 2 when we exclude orders for transportation equipment orders were flat most importantly orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft otherwise known as capital spending rose just 0 1 the shipment of these goods used to compute gdp was down 0 3 from october and is now down four of the past five months if there is no change in december shipments will be down 0 2 in q4 versus the average for q3 conclusion the economic data in aggregate suggests that we continue to see the economy grow but at a gradually slowing rate what is slowing growth and continues to be its greatest headwind is the surging amount of debt at the government corporate and consumer levels debt is boosting growth today but at the expense of tomorrow which no one seems to be concerned about i donâ t expect this to change in 2020 the decline in interest rates has made the existing debt manageable but that wonâ t last forever in an effort to prolong the longest expansion on record the fed cut interest rates three times this year to what is now a range of 1 50 1 75 it is also expanding its balance sheet in what looks to be a new quantitative easing program that it says will last well into the first half of 2020 yet this has not resulted in a pick up in the rate of economic growth corporate revenues continue to decline and there was no growth in corporate earnings or capital spending in 2019 the federal government will spend more than 1 trillion than it receives in tax revenues in the coming year with no plan to address this imbalance our economy would not be growing at all if not for this deficit spending the consumer remains the only bright spot but the rate of job creation is slowing and the peak in the rate of real wage growth was more than a year ago we are becoming increasingly reliant on declining borrowing costs to sustain a 2 rate of overall economic growth where the fed has been successful is in boosting the value of financial assets the wealth effect is firing on all cylinders at the moment with out sized returns for stocks bonds and commodities in 2019 what i canâ t quantify is the percentage of our economic growth 2 that is derived from this wealth effect we know that the majority of the benefit goes to the wealthiest american households top 10 but it is impossible to determine how that translates into additional spending on goods and services it does have an impact but it is a fraction of the impact it would have if the benefit went to the bottom 90 yet we also know that the bottom 90 feel more financially secure even if they are not when they see how well the stock market is performing this gives everyone the confidence to spend more even if it requires borrowing to do so my greatest concern for the year ahead is that the fed has fueled a surge in financial markets that is now so far divorced from economic fundamentals that an inevitable reversion to the mean will reverse this wealth effect the subsequent collapse in confidence will come at a time when our debt laden economy is barely growing the fed will have minimal firepower to address the next downturn with monetary stimulus the federal government will be equally impotent considering it just implemented a massive tax cut and faces 1 trillion deficits
whether on the debate stage or in the halls of congress over the past year democrats have misled the public on just about every major health care issue as 2019 draws to a close let s look at the five biggest things democrats got wrong on health care this year medicare for all supporters of medicare for all routinely engaged in financial fantasy sen elizabeth warren claimed her plan for that released in november would only increase federal spending by 20 5 trillion over a decade and would not require middle class tax increases most economists on the left and right and even sen bernie sanders who wrote the damn bill agree that medicare for all would cost more than 30 trillion over a decade jim breslo we re dying sooner instead of living longer here s why according to emory university economist kenneth e thorpe 70 percent of working privately insured americans would pay more for health insurance under a single payer system than they do today democrats also miscalculated the level of public support for medicare for all in march 2018 59 percent of people supported the idea according to polling from the kaiser family foundation by november 2019 more than a year and a half later 53 percent supported the plan socialized medicine abroad throughout the year sanders raved that canadian patients could walk into any hospital or doctor s office and get medical care free of charge he argued that canada showed how socialized medicine would work in the united states he s right but that undermines his case for single payer this year canadian patients waited over 20 weeks for treatment from a specialist following a referral from a general practitioner over a million canadians are currently on waiting lists for care canadians pay an awful lot for those waits the average canadian family of four s tax bill just for its government health coverage is more than 13 000 the public option with public enthusiasm for medicare for all declining moderate democrats have embraced the public option a new government run health plan designed to compete with private insurers two thirds of americans support a public option according to a november 2019 kaiser family foundation poll the idea s proponents say that it would guarantee all americans access to affordable coverage without forcing people to give up their existing private coverage when they weren t pushing to abolish private insurance democrats spent 2019 proposing a variety of misguided proposals to cut drug prices but a public option is just another route to medicare for all a government run plan would not have to cover its costs it could simply dip into the federal treasury its cost structure would also be lower than that for private insurers as a public plan would have the ability to dictate reimbursement rates for providers most public option plans envision paying doctors and hospitals little more than medicare does and medicare s payment rates are about 40 percent less than those for private insurance private insurers can t compete with that in short order private insurers would hemorrhage customers and eventually go out of business in that way the public option would become to borrow a phrase from south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg a natural glide path to medicare for all drug prices when they weren t pushing to abolish private insurance democrats spent 2019 proposing a variety of misguided proposals to cut drug prices most notable was house speaker nancy pelosi s lower drug costs now act which passed the house dec 12 click here to sign up for our opinion newsletter the bill would allow the government to set prices for up to 250 drugs like the price controls employed by governments throughout europe this plan would cripple biopharmaceutical research the white house council of economic advisers predicts pelosi s bill would result in 100 fewer new drugs over the next decade depriving patients with alzheimer s cancer and other diseases of potential cures obamacare last but not least democrats spent a big chunk of 2019 accusing the trump administration of sabotaging obamacare in september the census bureau announced that the number of insured people declined for the first time since the affordable care act was passed in 2010 but that decline was fueled in large part by the law itself obamacare s extensive rules and mandates caused average benchmark premiums to rise 75 percent from 2014 to 2019 click here to get the fox news app only people who receive government subsidies about 85 percent of those who shop on the exchanges can afford such expensive plans from 2016 to 2018 2 5 million people without subsidies dropped obamacare plans it s unlikely that democrats will change their tune on these five things in 2020 but ordinary americans shouldn t fall for the false health care promises that progressives are sure to offer during the election year to come click here to read more by sally pipes
new president rides high wave of popularity carves a niche by projecting himself as distinctly different from predecessors ranil due back tomorrow while party faces crisis within crisis over leadership and related issues once neutral sirisena now on four wheel overdrive for rajapaksas but unlikely to get top post after general elections as an old year gives way to a new one in just two days what lies ahead is the concern of most sri lankans expectations have been heightened after this yearâ s most significant event the presidential election on november 16 that a ruling coalition religiously dubbed as a good governance yahapalana government heaped burdens on the people and worked contrary to the pledges it made became clear following the remarkable mandate gotabaya rajapaksa received despite foreknowledge of impending attacks on easter sunday april 21 the fact that more than 268 men women and children paid with their lives sent a nerve wrecking chill in most parts of the country it caused a fear psychosis that spread far and wide the large death toll from a terrorist attack came when tiger guerrillas massacred over 774 policemen in the east in june 1990 second was the july 1996 guerrilla attack that led to the massacre of 207 persons whom the ltte had taken prisoner in mullaitivu by a strange coincidence also on april 21 1987 a car bomb was exploded by the ltte killing 113 persons at the central bus station in pettah the third largest toll the easter sunday attack was different in character and came from muslim extremists linked to a global network they preached their ideology and the same tactics were used tiger guerrillas raised money in one theatre purchased weapons in another to fight a separatist war in sri lanka easter sunday massacres were underscored by the majority of more than 1 3 million votes gotabaya rajapaksa won in other words those in the â southâ so to say lived in fear till they placed a cross on the ballot paper whilst a government was on â auto pilot â the probes were conducted more to protect political backers of the former regime than to elicit the truth key witnesses who saw the birth and growth of a new terrorist entity as senior police officers were not asked to testify the criminal investigation department cid is yet to name the masterminds or how the local group was linked to global terror a commission of inquiry is now going into the matter the polls proved wrong the forecasts of a college of the countryâ s renowned astrologers they foretold in a chorus that the national democratic front ndf backed sajith premadasa the united national party unp deputy leader would win bolstering it were the large crowds that turned up at ndf rallies and found prominence particularly in the social media a large crowd it is now known is by no means a yardstick to measure election victory those converging were mostly the politically conscious who are discerning enough to judge for themselves other than those who are paid meals and transport are free the outreach of the social media through mobile phones has made this important transition in the 43 days he has remained in office president gotabaya rajapaksa continues to ride the high wave of popularity he is carving a niche by projecting himself as a distinctly different personality from all his predecessors there are many factors that highlight this one is the appointment of most persons to head state institutions based on their qualifications he has resisted moves to foist political nominees with little or no knowledge this is notwithstanding some differences in opinion at the highest levels over leaving out other contenders who had been staunch supporters and worked during the election to that extent there is disgruntlement which has become the talking point among sections within the government those who complain argue that with a parliamentary election due they would find it difficult to seek their support adding to his popularity is the ban on import of motor vehicles by parliamentarians urging ministers and mps to go through public channels when they leave or return to the country and an ongoing review about personal security requirements for politicians yet president rajapaksa is embattled by a serious issue that concerns the public though for no fault of his prices of rice and vegetables have skyrocketed expensive items have vanished from the shelves of supermarkets and other shops an example is the price of onions just ahead of the presidential election the price for a kilo of red onions which stood at rs 240 has shot up to between rs 690 to rs 700 â green chillies which stood at rs 250 to rs 300 have risen to rs 550 these have been caused by crop failures due to incessant rains as has been the practice over the years the ministry responsible resorts to news releases to warn traders to sell at a controlled price or face action it ends there firstly most retailers do not heed such warnings that such shortages come just three months ahead of the national new year adds to the issue coupled with it is the impending parliamentary election if president rajapaksa has resorted to conducting surprise visits to government offices the ministers responsible have stopped at news releases and media conferences thus the issue is worsening making consumer items rare or their prices higher is one sure way in which the public can be turned around to dislike a government this is why the short sightedness of those responsible should not be ignored one of the first acts of president rajapaksa was to revise the previous governmentâ s burdensome tax measures it was intended to bring relief to the people the tax relief is yet to reach the consumer in the form of benefits resulting in scarcities and price increases international front on the international front the signals have been somewhat mixed though there was also a significant gain ahead of his visit to new delhi last month president rajapaksa declared in an interview with an indian website his first that the agreement with china over the hambantota port should be re negotiated he termed it as a â mistake â however just a few days ago he told foreign correspondents during a luncheon meeting that there was no need to re negotiate such an agreement he said only the security aspects would have to be looked at in the wake of the remarks the chinese embassy said in a statement â on december 19 h e president gotabaya rajapaksa met with the foreign correspondents based in colombo making it clear that the sri lankan government will not re negotiate the existing agreement on hambantota port and the commercial contract that has been signed will not be changed due to government changes the chinese side highly appreciates the remarks and is willing to guide relevant enterprises to work with the sri lankan side to expedite implementing the established agreement and further promote the prosperity and development of hambantota port once again that it highly respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sri lanka the security and control of hambantota port is entirely in the hands of the sri lankan government and navy which is not any different from other ports in sri lanka â â the statement by the chinese embassy in colombo included a colour photograph of a ship departing the hambantota port in their official website the remarks correcting what he said before did cause a flutter in the colombo based diplomatic community and raised eyebrows in new delhi nevertheless the manner in which the government handled the swiss embassy saga has won praise including from an unexpected quarter the opposition at least two ndf different seniors both not wanting to be identified said that the issue was tackled â very well â their point was that colombo did not yield to pressure from the swiss in emphasising in stronger terms that every sri lankan should follow the laws of the land of course they did stretch a point by allowing the counsel for the assistant migration officer garnier banister francis to be present when cid detectives recorded a statement from her in addition the swiss embassy staff watched at a distance though they could not hear what was spoken these were to ensure there is transparency and a move to demonstrate the bona fides of the government the case will come up before the chief magistrateâ s court in fort on monday banister francis who is now in the â y wardâ which houses twenty female remand prisoners has been assigned a lady prison official officers work on a roster round the clock to provide her additional protection though not surprising some of the colombo based ngos which have no alternative but to depend on dollars from donors set out their own policy over the swiss saga one of them decried and pilloried the media for naming the swiss embassy staffer they cannot be blamed for being blind to realities in the very countries that espouse the swiss case in colombo the media are free enough to run bold headlines on such issues at first bern refuses to co operate with the government which applies the laws of the land and then their ngo wallahs sing in a chorus that a sri lankan working for a diplomatic mission should not be named a corollary to the swiss saga is the role played by parties locally and this has become another key aspect of the investigation more than 40 telephone calls from a mobile phone to garnier francis around the period immediately before and after cid chief inspector nishantha de silva fled sri lanka is an aspect of the inquiry being conducted to ascertain what prime minister mahinda rajapaksa declared was a conspiracy against the government banister francis has said that the phone used by her was now with the embassy and the cid had sought a court order to obtain it defence and security front on the defence and security front too changes are in the offing one such move on the drawing boards is the amendment of the chief of defence staff act a piece of legislation that was introduced when mahinda rajapaksa was president in terms of that law the chief of staff is to be appointed from among the senior most of the three serving chiefs of the army navy and the air force a change is being considered to facilitate the inclusion of a senior officer whom the president deems fit either retired or serving there are also other challenges ahead of the un human rights council sessions in geneva in march the office of the high commissioner for human rights ohchr is due to release its report in february 2020 the foreign relations ministry has learnt through diplomatic channels that there is increased activity before the march sessions and that a more critical report on sri lanka was in the making one of the key issues for the government is whether it would still stand for the co sponsorship of the resolution a commitment made by the previous regime ironic enough there are no claimants for this co sponsorship except from then foreign minister mangala samaraweera president sirisena has publicly declared that he was unaware nor did the cabinet approve any proposal for it this is much the same way he as finance minister obtained cabinet approval before the presidential election for the millennium challenge corporation mcc deal with the united states this decision has been reversed by president rajapaksaâ s cabinet and a committee is now studying the matter the national economic council nec set up and later disbanded by former president maithripala sirisena had forwarded a report recommending against going ahead with the mcc deal those within the council allege that a week later a cabinet memorandum was forwarded to dismantle it there is still strong pressure by a powerful ngo to persuade the government to accept the deal a revision of diplomatic postings overseas is also on the cards altogether 14 political appointments made to sri lanka foreign missions have been annulled and they have been told to return before december 31 some have returned and the others are expected amidst this at least two posted in different parts of the globe it is learnt are seeking asylum in their host countries funny enough the reason given is that they fear for their lives they will create history for this is the first time the countryâ s envoys are seeking asylum in the host capital parliamentary elections it is in this developing scenario that the new government is preparing to face the parliamentary elections it does not take an astrologer or a soothsayer to say that the sri lanka podujana peramuna led alliance would win comfortably it is weighted heavily in its favour one of the main reasons is the disastrous state of affairs in the united national party unp which leads the national democratic front ndf amidst its mounting woes so far two former ministers have been arraigned before courts former megapolis minister champika ranawaka was arrested remanded and later released on issues arising over an accident in 2016 the matter is now before courts ranawaka told a gathering including members of the buddhist clergy at his new residence in battaramulla that he had done no wrong together with ex minister rajitha senaratne ranawaka was at the forefront of the campaign in late 2014 to oust the then regime of mahinda rajapaksa however for senaratne the issue is over a news conference he held two days before the presidential election he produced two persons who claimed they drove â white vansâ in which abductions were carried out they declared that those abducted were fodder for crocodiles in the swamps of moneragala they also said that that a large quantity of gold seized from tiger guerrillas during the conclusion of the separatist war had been illegally transported to colombo investigations revealed that these were total fiction and the stage play the news conference had been produced and directed by senaratne some of his former ministerial colleagues were aghast the two persons who also had cases against them have confessed that they were paid a million rupees each for saying what they did they had originally asked for rs 1 5 million each a corporation chairman under the health ministry appointed by senaratne it is alleged had paid the money despite a request to the cid by attorney general dappula de livera to arrest and produce senaratne before a magistrate they have not been able to do so those in the once premier flagship of the police department did not know where senaratne was nor did the former health minister who has brazenly made several incorrect statements as government spokesperson then think it correct to fight his case in the courts he absconded and on thursday night admitted himself to lanka hospital a magistrate visited him there after he was â arrestedâ and remanded him till tomorrow it was hilarious that unp general secretary akila viraj kariyawasam told a news conference that rajitha senaratne had â the freedom of speechâ to say what he wished at a news conference being a lawyer he should have known better paradoxical enough the unp is facing its worst crisis before a parliamentary election its leader and former prime minister ranil wickremesinghe took off to south india on a yearend holiday he is in ooty described as the gem among southern hill resorts in tamil nadu some 2 200 metres above sea level ooty or short for udhagamandalam is a resort town in the western ghats mountains founded as a british raj summer resort it retains a working steam railway line stone house a 19th century residence and the circa 1829 st stephenâ s church â making it worse the unp deputy leader sajith premadasa was stoically silent over the two incidents no statements have been forthcoming that the party is headless during a double crisis does not bode well for it wickremesinghe is due to arrive in colombo today he is scheduled to meet party seniors ahead of a meeting of the parliamentary group it is to take place either tomorrow or on january 2 â the main issue within the unp now is over the party leadership and the prime ministerial nominee wickremesinghe expects to retain the leadership and has declared he would concede the premiership to premadasa of course to wear that mantle he has to win the parliamentary elections yet the unp wants to define positions so that the members are not locked in disputes when the campaigning begins one of the main causes for the protracted delay is premadasaâ s on again and off again approach some of his own backers call it the aasai bayai or â love it but frightenedâ doctrine there is no gainsaying that he played the role of a presidential candidate remarkably well give or take a few bad lapses one of the lapses was to locate his campaign office in vauxhall lane and not at the unp headquarters at siri kotha in pita kotte as reported earlier the campaign was run from there by former unp general secretary tissa attanayake and former presidnt sirisenaâ s senior advisor shiral lakthilake it is now confirmed that the move was to make three top rungers in the unp livid they were malik samarawickrema mangala samaraweera and kabir hashim entrusted specifically with the campaign and side lined later the trio have on occasions confessed to close friends that the funds received were sufficient to run the campaign but premadasa has countered it by saying he is in bad debt this is the first time in the countryâ s political history that a party in power has not been able to muster sufficient funds for a polls campaign not even when they were touted largely as the winners unp reforms amidst the imbroglio wickremesinghe wants to make changes to his partyâ s constitution to â broad baseâ its leadership structure this can turn out to be the fly in the ointment during talks to reach accord wickremesinghe backers say that he wants to ensure changes and see party unity is restored should he decide to quit issues will have to be resolved almost immediately if the party is to launch even a reasonable election campaign â he does not want to give up when a crisis within the party is midway and face accusations of destroying it â said a source close to wickremesinghe of course others argued that the delay was to prevent premadasa winning the leadership parliament can be dissolved by the president any time after march 2 next year sections of the ruling alliance believe polls are likely only after the national new year season is over efforts are also under way to widen the membership of the national democratic front ndf by drawing the janatha vimukthi peramuna jvp informal soundings have already been made with the jvp and the tamil national alliance tna however jvp spokesperson vijitha herath said â we have already formed the national peopleâ s power movement and our next goal is to expand and strengthen to face the election we will not be forming any alliance with the unp â in an upcoming election campaign malik samarawickrema may not play a role he wants to retire from politics he has given up his private residence in colombo and opted to stay in an apartment mangala samaraweera who was touted as quitting politics after his image took a severe beating over his controversial remarks has chosen to remain in politics he is now holidaying in london for him it has been a paradoxical about turn he once asked premadasa to look in the mirror after the unp deputy leader called ranil wickremesinghe a napunsakaya or a eunuch weeks earlier premadasa without referring to him by name hit out saying there were ministers who made controversial remarks and that contributed to his defeat the post presidential election period saw premadasa literally withdrawing into a shell and turning non aggressive and staying incommunicado the post election developments are sure to affect premadasaâ s campaign however party general secretary akila viraj kariyawasa told the sunday times â we will strengthen every unp â balamandalaâ to secure a victory in the election during the upcoming year â he added â we are doing everything we can to maintain unity within the party but if we continue to move without it we will have no options â therein lies the crux of the problems within unp the more the crisis prolongs the more time the party would take to activate the grassroots level organisations and launch a campaign the unp also has to be mindful of the so called vaasi peththata hoiyya votes or votes for the side that has profited these votes will not come to the ndf another key issue would be who would lead premadasaâ s parliamentary election campaign besides the all important issue of funds the question arises because of the trio â samarawickrema samaraweera and hashim â were virtually left out during the presidential poll in the event of a unified agreement being reached a campaign committee and other related issues could be endorsed at a planned convention possibly in january next year parliament vote amidst these developments there was speculation in political circles over what would follow the ceremonial opening of parliament on january 3 formidable sections of the ndf want to seek a debate on the policy statement by president gotabaya rajapaksa it will enumerate the policies of the government including areas that will receive priority attention a main question over this is whether or not the opposition will call for a division at the end of the debate a government minister who did not wish to be named said there was no move â at all to prorogue parliamentâ and added that â there will be no issue in conceding a debate â however he refused to comment when asked about a vote â that is a matter to be decided at higher levels â he pointed out yet a group of slpp led alliance members are to raise the issue over speaker karu jayasuriya visiting the remand prison to meet former minister and jathika hela urumaya leader patali champika ranawaka a note prepared by them claimed that 16 mps who were then in the opposition were in remand prison but the speaker had not paid them visits speaker jayasuriya however contends that he paid the visit since he was not formally informed in keeping with parliamentary tradition that ranawaka an mp was arrested sirisenaâ s political moves the same alliance where the sri lanka freedom party slfp is a partner is yet to decide on the symbol under which their members would contest the parliamentary elections slfp general secretary dayasiri jayasekera told the sunday times he said the alliance of 18 political parties would contest to â form a strong stable government for the next five years â he said discussions on issues related to the parliamentary election would take place with slpp leaders maithripala sirisena who remained â neutralâ during the presidential election has not only regained slfp leadership but has now vowed both to president rajapaksa and premier mahinda rajapaksa that he would ensure a two thirds victory in motoring terms he has now gone on four wheel overdrive for this purpose to ensure the forthcoming election campaign produces that result how far that peace overture will go is not clear but the slpp leadership is incensed with the â neutralâ role he played they say they have many reasons to believe he tacitly backed premadasa that makes clear that premadasa will have no secret ally at the parliamentary elections and no tacit support that is not all it has also put paid to sirisenaâ s wishes to gain a top slot in the government as a cabinet minister yet he will contest the parliamentary elections on the slfp quota from the slpp led joint alliance the prospects of a victory for him are not in question another critical issue for the government in 2020 is the fate of the 19th amendment to the constitution whilst a formidable section of the government wants it to remain intact there are others equally formidable who want it abolished altogether the 19a is largely the product of two lawyers in parliament backing the unp its emergence also generated political controversy commenting on the advent of new years american journalist the late bill vaughan once remarked â an optimist stays up until midnight to see the new year in a pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves â â however it would be a different story when it comes to the next parliamentary elections both the optimists and the pessimists know the outcome already they do not have to lose any sleep over it
india s gdp growth has decelerated to 4 5 per cent in the second quarter of the current fiscal and the government remains clueless on how to deal with it neither consumption nor export nor private investment are supportive as of now india s economic growth is being driven by government expenditure however slowing economic growth will lower tax collections and cap the government s ability to finance any serious stimulus package from the expenditure side the magnitude of india s deepening slowdown can be observed in three of the four major components of the gdp consumption investment and export excluding government expenditure which comprises not more than 13 per cent the indian economy grew 3 05 per cent in the july september quarter thus the current situation is much worse than what the headline growth number shows export prospects let s start with exports the government has been hinting that global headwinds are behind sluggish exports and not without reason the us is increasingly turning protectionist president donald trump has removed india from the us gsp beneficiary list which had adverse implications on major export items such as chemicals pharmaceuticals and engineering goods american tightening of immigration rules has dampened it export prospects the eu is struggling to deal with brexit and slowing growth in its major economies such as germany the middle east another major export market for indian merchandise is troubled by its over reliance on oil and increasing political tensions between iran and saudi arabia supply chains are now sourcing more locally than before all these developments are bound to affect india s exports however what the government is not saying is that india s merchandise exports have been hovering around 300 billion for almost eight years now it was 305 billion in fy12 and 303 billion in fy18 in fy19 it rose to 330 billion but export prospects remain bleak in the current financial year obviously the problem lies somewhere else most of india s merchandise exports are commodities undifferentiated products with not much pricing power thus a weaker rupee doesn t make much difference to such exports countries like bangladesh and vietnam are fast replacing india in areas it traditionally dominated for example ready made garments in fact india s textile majors such as arvind and raymond are silently shifting their production base to ethiopia to take advantage of cheaper labour and electricity vietnam is doing far better in attracting top electronics manufacturers lowered demand a number of factors are responsible for slowdown in consumption comprising over 57 per cent of the country s gdp that fell to 5 1 per cent in q2 fy20 compared to 9 8 per cent in q2 fy19 continuing rural distress accentuated first by the note ban and then through domestic and global supply gluts caps rural demand the wholesale prices of most pulses crops such as tur red gram urad black gram channa bengal gram and oilseeds are 15 30 per cent lower now in contrast the cost of major farm inputs and equipment such as high speed diesel dap insecticides and pesticides tractors cattle feeds and electricity have gone up by 10 per cent or so squeezing margins lower margins reduce farmers income and affect their demand for goods and services high taxation and regulatory rent seeking in sectors such as automobile and real estate are aiding the demand slowdown for instance effective taxation is up to 50 per cent for automobiles similarly high gst on key inputs eg cement protectionism induced high priced steel along with the prohibitive stamp duty and registration charges are keeping home prices artificially high and capping demand given their strong backward and forward linkages with many other industries and services the demand slowdown in these two is bringing down dependent industries rising household debts and credit crunch in the shadow banking space important for automobiles consumer durables and homes are further contributing to the demand slowdown and forcing companies to operate below capacities no wonder investment as measured by the gross fixed capital formation gfcf grew by a meagre 1 0 per cent in q2 2019 20 even as its share in the gdp continued to decline the decline in capacity is reflected by the 5 8 per cent contraction in eight core sector industries which make up 40 per cent of the total industrial production government investments which generally bridge the gap during the slowdown started losing steam as state governments capex which makes up the major share of public investments has shrunk in the last two quarters tax collection nevertheless a 15 6 per cent increase in government expenditure in the second quarter compared to 10 9 per cent same quarter last fiscal has contributed one third of the 4 5 per cent gdp growth rate however government demand is primarily dependent upon tax revenue as it can t really borrow much without forcing interest rates to rise crowding out private investment direct tax including corporate and personal income tax grew 5 per cent in the april september period compared to the same period last year thus to achieve the budgeted target of 17 3 per cent in fy20 it must grow by a whopping 27 per cent highly unlikely gst collection remains muted due to slowing growth and a low base only 1 2 million out of 62 million companies are gst registered given this backdrop the ill advised corporate tax cut estimated to cost 1 45 trillion will further limit the government s ability to spend and support growth in the absence of adequate consumer demand corporates are using low interest rates to improve margins and indulging in share buybacks to further their stock market prospects similarly halving of corporate tax has not led to any big bang private investment lower return on bank deposits in a country wherein these remain the primary channel of savings for most indians especially the retired and senior citizens cutting interest rates may dampen consumption demand through their negative wealth effect that being said the government can do two things to revive demand and induce the private sector to invest even in short run the gst council should increase the rates on low gst items with inelastic demand and reduce rates for high gst items with elastic demand this will reduce rate differentials and discourage gst evasion and corruption boosting consumer demand and in turn prompting businesses to ramp up their capex plans as the revival of demand remains the key to reviving private investment it would help to consider reducing income tax rates for lower income people if not for all rather than increased import duties a weaker rupee can provide protection to domestic manufacturers and yet improve export competitiveness source the hindu business line
