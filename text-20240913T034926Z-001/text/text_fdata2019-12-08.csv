argentina is on the verge of a new economic disaster peronist alberto fernández thinks he can figure it out joaquin temes it is troubling that throughout the whole transition president elect alberto fernández hasn t made clear what his plans to put argentina back on its feet as his campaign slogan went are now with the cabinet unveiled and matías kulfas leading the production ministry and martín guzman in the economy ministry the only concrete concepts to expect beyond december 10 are tied to a social pact that is supposed to magically jumpstart the economy coupled with heavy money printing and a tough stance in terms of the debt renegotiation with the international monetary fund and private creditors a false sense of calm had taken over argentina since the october elections most relieved of all it seemed was president mauricio macri not only did he secure a major comeback in terms of his coalition s electoral outcome coming back from a humiliating defeat in the paso primaries to a dignified defeat but he had guaranteed the conditions to become the first non peronist president to finish his term in a nearly a century unfortunately the mechanism through which he bought stability is extremely corrosive to argentina s economy capital controls known colloquially as el cepo through hardened currency controls the central bank led by guido sandleris has managed to put a lid on the draining of foreign reserves a major preoccupation of the president elect yet the cepo has destroyed economic activity the black market rate has begun to take off with one of the several parallel rates reaching some eighty pesos to a dollar at one point as people have been limited to a mere us 200 per month in offical dollars it s clear that while macri s extreme liberalization of the foreign exchange market had the unwanted effect of feeding intense capital flight currency controls are the worst enemy not only of economic activity but also of foreign direct investment one clear example can be seen in the energy sector where the macri administration s populist freeze on gas prices had cramped production at the vaca muerta shale formation the freeze was finally lifted in mid november ypf the state owned energy firm has found itself locked out of international debt markets meaning it has been forced to use cash instead of refinancing its debts that cash could have been used for productive investments much needed in the capital intensive world of non conventional production yet macri will leave the economy with a cepo currency control just as he received it and alberto and his team will most probably keep that cepo in place at the root of the issue are two interrelated situations the need to control inflation and the need to renegotiate argentina s debt starting with inflation our country s true cancer alberto and his team s magical solution is a social pact which will come with some sort of agreement with producers regarding prices and wages this will also include the generally conflictive union sector which has already expressed its support for fernández and his running mate former president cristina fernández de kirchner the social pact would most probably raise wages while keeping prices fixed for some 180 days while at the same time include money printing in order to put money in people s pockets this given inflationary momentum after finishing 2019 with price increases of around 60 percent is extremely troubling some economists have justified the expansion of the money supply given the tourniquet put in place by sandleris central bank noting that inflation is not a monetary phenomenon and that stationary peso demand rises in december the social pact should put a lid on inflationary expectations for the coming six months despite a flooding of pesos that will not be absorbed or sterilized as short term papers leliqs aren t renewed the wave of pesos will grow at some point the cepo will need to be relaxed if alberto s pan peronist coalition dreams of attracting foreign investment at some point the situation will turn explosive in parallel alberto s teams have held informal meetings with argentina s creditors the biggest problem will be the imf which alberto has criticized consistently asking them to own up to macri s economic failure the imf s preferred creditor status can become problematic as wall street is looking to them to take the heat yet the multilateral institution claims the banks have to suffer so that moral hazard keeps the system honest throughout all this noise alberto repeated throughout the transition that argentina cannot pay its debts in these conditions and that he needs the economy to grow he indicated the country will not ask for the remaining money in the imf bailout the catch 22 is evident in order to put argentina s finances in order alberto and his team need to renegotiate the terms on the sovereign debt and relax capital controls the negotiation needs to be resolved quickly as it is a prerequisite of lifting some parts of the cepo but the rhetoric makes that unlikely as does the limited progress made thus far the appointment of martín guzman as economy minister suggests argentina s position in the negotiating table could be relatively tough fernández s secret weapon could be weirdly enough donald trump the president of the united states called him to tell him how great a president alberto would be in early november through an interpreter the president elect thanked him and told the press the donald would help him out with the imf this last point wasn t reported in the white house s version of events trump though could need an ally in alberto his buddy jair bolsonaro is facing a difficult time in brazil while the wave of anti establishment sentiment spreading throughout latin america threatens the region s stability and a return to leftist populism former brazilian president luiz inácio lula da silva has walked from jail after nearly two years behind bars he remains brazil s most popular politician chile is imploding ecuador has blown up evo morales was ousted in bolivia after manipulating his way into a fourth term trump has proven he s flexible when he wants to be cozying up with mexico s andrés manuel lópez obrador who was the first leader alberto visited as presidentelect argentina needs to regain trust trust of its people trust of the business community investors trust if alberto fernández manages to effectively renegotiate the debt on favorable terms ease currency controls and enact this social pact all in a relative short term he may have won the trust of a group of people having the main ingredient to curb inflation if and only if all of this works perfectly which i doubt then he must enact unpopular reforms that macri was unable to complete including a reduction in social spending and pension payments and he must do this as the electoral cycle picks up pace again with midterm elections in 2021 expecting all of this to flow seamlessly appears like wishful thinking let s hope it s not this piece was originally published in the buenos aires times argentina s only english language

home archives 2006 on 2019 india exits the rcep what happens next by kavaljit singh on november 4 india announced its decision to exit the negotiations on the proposed regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep a mega regional free trade agreement prime minister narendra modi conveyed the decision at the third rcep summit that took place in bangkok the summit was attended by the leaders of all the 16 rcep participating countries rpcs the full text of pm modi s address at the rcep summit is not yet available but according to a tweet by prasar bharati india s official broadcaster mr modi stated the present form of the rcep agreement does not fully reflect the basic spirit and the agreed guiding principles of rcep it also does not address satisfactorily india s outstanding issues and concerns in such a situation it is not possible for india to join the rcep agreement 1 during a media briefing at bangkok india s foreign ministry official added india had significant issues of core interest that remained unresolved india has participated in good faith in the rcep discussions and has negotiated hard with a clear eyed view of our interests in the given circumstances we believe that not joining the agreement is the right decision for india 2 with india opting out of the rcep negotiations the remaining 15 rpcs have decided to move ahead with the proposed agreement in a joint statement issued on november 4 the rcep leaders noted fifteen rcep participating countries have concluded text based negotia tions for all 20 chapters and essentially all their market access issues and tasked legal scrubbing by them to commence for signing in 2020 now onwards 15 rpcs will be working towards signing the agreement by late 2020 while still trying to resolve india s main concerns so that it could consider joining the pact what is rcep the rcep is a proposed fta between the ten member states of the association of south east asian nations asean and their six fta partner countries australia china india japan south korea and new zealand it covers a wide range of issues including trade in goods and services investment intellectual property rights competition policy e commerce dispute settlement and economic and technical cooperation the rcep negotiations began in cambodia in 2013 with an expectation to conclude the talks by the end of 2015 after missing several deadlines repeatedly the talks were slated for the conclusion by november 2019 during the 35th asean summit in bangkok just like any other rpc india s approach towards the rcep negotiations was guided by its core interests broadly speaking india was seeking a development friendly pact that can provide sufficient flexibility so that domestic producers can withstand competition while harnessing the gains from trade in services especially the it and it enabled services in which india enjoys international competitive advantage whereas china expects the rcep to complement its belt and road initiative in the region and thereby further strengthen regional economic integration door still open for india while the ruling and opposition political parties in india are claiming credit for the decision to exit the rcep negotiations the fact remains that india can still join the rcep before it is signed next year this option is underscored in the joint statement issued by the rcep leaders on november 4 which states india has significant outstanding issues which remain unresolved all rcep participating countries will work together to resolve these outstanding issues in a mutually satisfactory way india s final decision will depend on satisfactory resolution of these issues 3 later on the trade ministers of australia singapore and japan expressed hopes that india will continue talks on the outstanding issues 4 while the chinese vice foreign minister le yucheng stated whenever india is ready it s welcome to get on board 5 theoretically the probability of india joining the proposed trade pact cannot be ruled out even though there are slim chances of resolving multiple outstanding issues within the stipulated time domestically it may be difficult for the modi government to take a u turn on the rcep given the nationwide protests organized by a wide range of constituencies including farmers groups trade unions and political parties for india the rcep would have been its biggest fta and the country would have to offer far deeper commitments than already made under its existing ftas with the asean malaysia singapore south korea and japan hence most rpcs would like india to join the rcep as it offers them preferential access to the potentially large indian market for australia additional market access for agricultural exports would be substantial if india joins the rcep because it already has an fta with all rpcs except india some key concerns after joining the rcep india would have had to eliminate tariffs on almost 90 per cent of items from the asean japan and south korea and on more than 74 per cent of items from china australia and new zealand even the supporters of the rcep acknowledge that the fear of cheaper imports displacing domestic production is real and the proposed pact could negatively affect the livelihoods of millions of indians besides posing a potential threat to the make in india initiative in india the consequences of cheaper imports displacing domestic production would be far reaching as close to 93 per cent of the country s workforce is in the informal sector unlike australia new zealand and japan india lacks a comprehensive social safety net to fall back on the main concern is that india would be flooded with cheaper imported goods such as manufactured goods from china and dairy products from new zealand once the tariff and non tariff trade barriers are removed under the rcep this concern cannot be easily dismissed given the steep rise in imports from china in recent years in 2018 for instance the volume of bilateral trade between china and india reached 87 billion with the trade deficit hitting 53 billion in china s favour a trade deficit is not bad per se but such a massive trade deficit with china is not sustainable india has been demanding lower barriers for pharma and it exports to china but little progress has been made so far to address this issue equally worrisome is the composition of india s trade with china india s exports to china primarily consist of raw materials such as iron ore metals and cotton while china s exports to india are dominated by finished manufactured products such as mobile phones and electrical machinery in 2018 india registered a trade deficit with 11 out of 15 rpcs trade analysts have pointed out that india s trade deficit with the rpcs will further increase if it joins the rcep on the current terms 6 at the same time there was little interest among other rpcs to lower barriers to trade in services as india was keen to push for greater liberalisation of trade in it and it enabled services especially in mode 4 due to its globally competitive it sector the contentious investment chapter another contentious issue for india was the investment chapter of the proposed rcep the negotiations on the investment chapter were dragged on far longer than anticipated right from the beginning japan and korea were seeking higher standards for investment protection besides the incorporation of the investor state dispute settlement isds mechanism that would allow investors from the rpcs to bypass domestic courts of host states and sue a host state through international arbitration proceedings japan also sought a complete ban on caps on royalty payments and a ban on technology transfer on a negative list basis on the other hand india sought a more cautious approach based on public policy protection and limited coverage as the country is facing more than 12 arbitration suits under previously signed bilateral investment treaties leaked documents reveal that a compromise was reached at the final round of negotiations september 2019 for not including the isds in the present agreement because the negotiators wanted to conclude the rcep negotiations by november 2019 however under the work programme the rpcs agreed to enter into discussions on isds provision within two years after the entry of force of the rcep agreement and conclude them within three years from the start of discussions apart from the isds mechanism india was also not keen to include controversial clauses such as asset based definition of investment fair and equitable treatment and most favoured nation under the investment chapter of the rcep as these clauses are inconsistent with the new model bit text 2015 that defines india s overall policy towards investment agreements by accepting such provisions under the proposed rcep india would have effectively replaced its model text with a new template that gives extensive rights and protection to foreign investors while constricting the national policy space also india was not amenable to accept disciplines relating to intellectual property rights iprs and electronic commerce as demanded by some rpcs india s adverse experience with existing ftas as i have discussed elsewhere 7 india s experience with earlier ftas with japan south korea and asean countries has been far from satisfactory these ftas have not resulted in a more balanced and mutually beneficial trade post fta bilateral trade volumes have increased but imports from partner countries have increased at a faster pace than india s exports with partners due to its relatively higher tariff regime india had to reduce tariffs much more than partner countries with the result india s trade deficit with existing fta partners in the region increased consistently after the implementation of ftas apart from the lack of competitiveness indian exporters have not been able to achieve greater benefits from existing ftas due to low awareness and cumbersome rules of origin according to the estimates of the asian development bank the utilisation rate of india s ftas varies between five and 25 per cent one of the lowest in the region as far as the services sector is concerned india could not secure greater market access in its trade agreement with asean in the case of bilateral trade agreements with south korea japan malaysia and singapore where india successfully negotiated the mutual recognition agreements mras aimed at facilitating the movement of it and other service professionals anticipated gains have not yet materialised because of weak enforcement of the mras goodbye rcep hello india us fta while india has now opted out of the rcep negotiations it has not completely abandoned its policy of pursuing free trade agreements at present india is negotiating as many as 15 free trade agreements including with australia and new zealand while another 12 ftas are proposed under consultation and study currently bilateral discussions are underway between india and the us on a limited interim agreement in the near term and a highly ambitious and broader fta over the longer term the broader fta may also cover a wide range of issues including trade in services iprs e commerce and investment as the negotiations on a standalone india us bilateral investment treaty have not progressed both trading partners may incorporate an investment chapter under the broader fta in the interim agreement the us would like india to consider lower tariffs on ict items and agricultural products besides removing price controls on medical devices such as stents and knee implants whereas india would like the us to immediately restore benefits to indian exporters under the generalised system of preferences that was terminated by the trump administration in june 2019 the indian trade negotiators should draw red lines around many issues of india s interests to achieve desired outcomes from a trade pact with the us make no mistake indian trade negotiators will face daunting challenges particularly in the areas of iprs investments e commerce and agricultural sectors once they start negotiations on an ambitious india us fta with their american counterparts in the coming days the same will the case when indian and european trade negotiators resume negotiations on the long pending india eu free trade agreement stop chasing elusive strategic gains a section in the indian policy establishment strongly believes that free trade agreements could be useful policy tools to achieve geopolitical and strategic objectives and therefore should be evaluated through strategic lenses too to a large extent this viewpoint shaped india s approach towards ftas and paved the way for several trade pacts with east asian countries since the mid 2000s across the world there is plenty of evidence to show that free trade agreements are not useful tools to pursue geopolitical and strategic objectives to illustrate take the case of the north american free trade agreement nafta a trilateral agreement between the united states canada and mexico also known as the gold standard of the trade deal thanks to nafta 80 per cent of mexico s global exports go to the us but this trade agreement did not deter mexico from voting against the us over iraq at the un mexico pursues an independent foreign policy determined by its national interests in recent years mexico and the us have often differed on many strategic issues as a member state of the asean the philippines is a signatory to a free trade agreement with china yet this small country filed a case against china at the permanent court of arbitration pca in the hague in 2013 claiming that china had infringed on its territorial rights in the south china sea in 2016 the pca ruled in favour of the philippines back home india signed a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement ceca with malaysia in 2011 in addition to an india asean ceca that came into effect in 2010 even though both these agreements are currently in operation the malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad recently criticised new delhi s actions in kashmir at the united nations general assembly this year sri lanka and india have opposing views on several geopolitical matters despite both the countries having signed a free trade agreement way back in 1998 this is not to say that a trade pact may not have any strategic implications but one should not overlook the fundamental point that india s future engagements with the ftas should be premised on hard economic terms what must be kept in mind is the real economic costs and benefits rather than elusive geopolitical gains as fantasised by the successive indian governments in the recent past reshaping india s trade policy as there are strong protectionist sentiments against india s software and services exports industry in key markets the chances of india becoming an economic powerhouse through services exports are very slim at a time when the indian economy is passing through a difficult time with weak industrial growth agrarian distress and a severe unemployment crisis the government should pay more attention to boost domestic demand in the short and medium term a policy change is essential to ensure that unbridled integration through ftas should not accentuate multiple crises before expanding its global footprint through ftas india must put its own house in order by strengthening the domestic productive capacities enhancing r d and mobilising resources to improve the physical and social infrastructure so that domestic producers can compete in the international markets there are a host of domestic issues that needs to be addressed to make the indian industry globally competitive simultaneously new delhi should conduct a thorough review of india s existing ftas based on that review the government should delineate its policy approach towards bilateral and regional trade agreements all negotiations on future ftas should be carried out in tandem with or as part of the overall fta policy framework in close consultations with other ministries it becomes all the more important as nowadays ftas are increasingly becoming broader with provisions on trade in services public procurement investment e commerce and iprs the indian authorities should collect country wise data on trade in services and other transactions to assess the effects both positive and negative of free trade agreements on the economy domestically the government should initiate meaningful consultations with various stake holders including the state governments on all trade policy matters the rcep is not the last free trade agreement in the world there would be plenty of opportu nities for india to engage with bilateral and regional free trade agreements in the coming years what is needed is a holistic approach towards trade policy in general and ftas in particular india s overall trade policy needs to be much less ad hoc than it is now endnotes 1 2 the transcript of media briefing by secretary east during pm s visit to thailand november 4 2019 is available at

the massachusetts senator has built her campaign for the democratic presidential nomination around the idea that the time has come for those who have done really well in the last few decades to pay their fair share so others don t have to struggle as much to get by she would use the trillions in new revenue to pay for an ambitious set of social programs the latest tally 15 new or expanded revenue generating measures that warren says would raise more than 21 trillion over 10 years an amount equal to a little less than half of the 46 trillion that the congressional budget office estimates the federal government would already collect in taxes from 2020 through 2029 the wealthiest americans and corporations would shoulder almost all of the tab i have a plan for that senator elizabeth warren says she has a tax for that too advertisement but after carrying her into the top tier of candidates warren s momentum has stalled amid pushback from moderate democrats who worry that some of her proposals especially medicare for all the largest and most costly by far are too extreme and will alienate crucial middle of the road and swing voters get trendlines a business newsletter from globe columnist larry edelman covering the trends shaping business and the economy in boston and beyond enter email sign up this is more than a disagreement over the best political strategy to deny president trump a second term it s a tug of war for the soul of a democratic party split over just how far left it should tack to rein in what many voters see as out of control capitalism that has allowed the rich to get richer the poor to get poorer and the middle class to inexorably wither what is the fair fair share for one percenters and corporate america to pay how much control over markets and business should the government wield where democrats land on these questions will have profound implications not only for the 2020 election but for how the country charts its future economic course advertisement the gap i have a plan for that the quip that became a campaign slogan captures warren s political persona the distinct mix of dead serious policy prescriptions and a self deprecating nod to her ivory tower earnestness she s a dogmatic pragmatist but also unafraid to aim high and with boldness senator bernie sanders who in many ways blazed the economic populist trail for warren is a self proclaimed socialist who has long wanted to dismantle some core elements of capitalism and start anew warren who labels herself a capitalist wants to recalibrate the markets through aggressive regulation and taxation yet the two candidates have much in common including a unified theory of everything the us political and economic systems are rigged to keep wealth and power in the hands of the elite read through the 50 plus plans on warren s website and it s clear that many are designed primarily or as a secondary benefit to put more money and influence in the hands of ordinary people among warren s key advisers are two economists from the university of california berkeley emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman who have dug deeply into the issue of wealth and income inequality she frequently highlights two troubling trends that emerge from their work first the share of wealth held by the richest top 0 1 percent of american families or 75 000 households has risen nearly threefold to 20 percent from the late 1970s through 2016 while the share of the bottom 90 percent has dropped to 25 percent from 35 percent advertisement second that top 0 1 percent will pay an estimated 3 2 percent of their wealth in federal state and local taxes this year while the bottom 99 percent are projected to owe 7 2 percent warren s objective is to moderate such inequities and fix the system that perpetuates them to do so she would roll back policies adopted over more than 40 years first by republicans and later by centrist democrats that prioritize an unfettered marketplace and antipathy for social welfare and have disproportionately helped the wealthy instead to a degree not seen since the mid 1960s a warren administration would she says aggressively intervene to shrink the wealth gap limit the clout of big business and the rich protect the little guy and take on climate change wealth tax warren would use her tax hikes and revenue from closing loopholes and ending subsidies to pay for a host of spending initiatives aimed at shrinking the wealth gap free universal health coverage and subsidized child care student debt relief and elimination of public college tuitions money for k 12 education and affordable housing and more generous social security benefits first warren would repeal two thirds of the 1 5 trillion in tax cuts that mark the biggest legislative success of trump s administration while individual rates fell the changes including a reduction in the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and the immediate deduction of capital investments mostly benefited big companies and the rich advertisement her most discussed revenue generator is a wealth tax which warren estimates would bring in 3 75 trillion over a decade households with net assets of 50 million to 1 billion would pay a 2 percent annual levy on their wealth amounts above 1 billion would be taxed at 6 percent warren while noting that the rich have many strategies to reduce income taxes and are sure to resist her proposed levy says the surcharge on assets would not only pay for essential programs but also chip away year by year generation after generation at a wealth gap that is only growing wider and more pernicious while we must make income taxes more progressive that alone won t straighten out our slanted tax code or our lopsided economy she writes in her wealth tax plan critics of the wealth tax including some democrats raise concerns not only about fairness but also its effectiveness and potential to hurt the economy the organisation for economic co operation and development an international policy research group whose 36 member nations include the united states studied the issue and ticked off a list of possible negative outcomes a reduction in saving and investment disincentives for entrepreneurship a rise in tax avoidance strategies and a thicket of problems around how to accurately value the assets to be taxed larry summers the former president of harvard university who served as treasury secretary under bill clinton is a high profile opponent of wealth taxes in a blog post summers and natasha sarin an assistant law professor at the university of pennsylvania wrote that warren s plan would likely not raise as much money as the candidate estimates and would not dilute the economic and political clout of the richest americans as she intends advertisement investing substantial political capital into a tax model that is untried in the united states and has failed internationally strikes us as unwise they said wealth taxes were once popular in europe with 12 countries using some form of the levy in 1990 today norway spain and switzerland are the only european governments that still collect them beyond the wealth tax warren also wants to change how the rich pay capital gains taxes bringing in 2 trillion over 10 years to help fund medicare for all and expand the federal tax on inherited wealth to fund most of a 500 billion affordable housing plan and then there is social security known as the third rail of american politics because efforts to touch it are dangerous warren proposes to increase benefits for all current and future recipients by 2 400 a year and change rules to boost benefits for lower income families women people with disabilities public sector workers and people of color again the money to do this would come from the affluent the top 1 5 million families according to her social security plan the campaign hasn t said how much money the new social security taxes would bring in but points to an analysis by moody s that estimates warren s changes would reduce the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion over 10 years and extend the solvency of the social security trust fund by 20 years economic patriotism for warren leveling the playing field also means protecting american workers and reversing the agglomeration of power held by the country s biggest companies when the senator talks about corporate america manufacturing and foreign trade she hits some of the same protectionist notes as the president she loathes us companies must stop sending jobs overseas the government needs to pursue trade deals that help not hurt american workers the economy isn t expanding as robustly as it could be if we want faster growth stronger american industry and more good american jobs then our government should do what other leading nations do and act aggressively to achieve those goals instead of catering to the financial interests of companies with no particular allegiance to america she writes in her economic patriotism agenda warren peppers many of her plans with proposals to boost jobs and wages she would require directors of companies with more than 1 billion in revenue to weigh the interests of all corporate stakeholders employees vendors local communities and not just shareholders when making decisions and in another trumpian echo she would push to manage the value of the us dollar that is lower it relative to other currencies to support us manufacturers by making their products cheaper for foreign buyers she also has a long list of measures designed to curb the power of giant companies promote competition and protect consumers amazon facebook and google would be broken up into smaller companies to reduce their control of key markets and consumers personal data the nation s largest banks would be more closely regulated and too big too fail institutions would be downsized to prevent abusive practices and another financial crisis antitrust laws would be strictly enforced and past consolidations in technology agribusiness and pharmaceuticals would be revisited and potentially undone drug companies would be required to negotiate lower prices in a move that would disrupt the higher education sector in massachusetts and across the country warren has proposed forgiving student loan debt and making tuition at public colleges and universities free the idea is to make a good education accessible to more students and redirect money now going to tuitions and paying down debt into the economy but college leaders worry the initiative could swamp already resource strained public institutions while further limiting the appeal of private liberal arts schools of course the biggest and most sweeping of warren s proposals is for a government run health insurance system through the early stages of her campaign she was not eager to endorse medicare for all which is closely associated with bernie sanders and even less eager to explain how she would fund it but after being pressed by rivals and television debate moderators warren recently spelled out her financing plan she would use money from a variety of her new taxes and rely on wringing out significant costs from the health care system most important she would require employers to kick in 8 8 trillion essentially redirecting the private insurance premiums they pay now warren says employers would end up paying 200 billion less than they do under the current system medicare for all has emerged as the most divisive issue among candidates and democrat voters the prospect of being forced into a government plan scares many americans who have good coverage through their jobs the public option making medicare for all a choice under the affordable care act rather than a mandate is favored by moderates such as former vice president joe biden and minnesota senator amy klobuchar moreover a single payer system would not only put many private insurers and their employees out of business it is likely to squeeze many doctors hospitals and other service providers as the government leverages its buying power to drive down costs in massachusetts hospitals such as massachusetts

environmental outlook warren pitches her environmental agenda as a jobs and stimulus package a 21st century version of eisenhower s interstate highway program or jfk s moon shot in september she got behind washington governor jay inslee s plan to convert us electricity generation transportation and homes and commercial buildings to 100 percent clean energy and laid out a 10 year 3 trillion vision on how to get there with corporations paying the bill the main items 1 5 trillion for purchases of us made clean energy products for use by federal state and local governments and for sale overseas 400 billion for clean energy research and 100 billion to support exports of us made clean energy technology warren says these initiatives would create millions of good paying jobs and make the united states the leader in clean tech they would be financed in part by a new 7 percent tax on corporate profits exceeding 100 million there is a second big piece to warren s climate mitigation strategy 1 trillion to accelerate the shift to green building products zero emission vehicles and clean and renewable electricity the costs of this initiative would be covered by repealing the gop corporate tax cuts of 2017 political realities while warren pairs her trillion dollar spending plans with trillions of dollars in new taxes at some point it makes little sense to try to balance her campaign promise budget projections for government spending and revenue are notoriously hard to get right how much will it really cost to provide a no tuition public college education for anyone who wants one how much money will the government raise from a wealth tax which is a daunting undertaking that has stymied other countries can warren really drive down costs in health care then there is political reality even if warren becomes president many of her proposals would require the approval of congress and in the case of the wealth tax maybe even a supreme court ruling that it is constitutional primary voters in both parties lean toward the extremes which is an advantage for warren but it could be a problem in the general election where appeal to democratic and gop moderates independents and disillusioned republicans in swing states will be essential progressives young and old say that trump can be dislodged only with a promise of bold change they argue that requiring the wealthiest people to shoulder the cost of bread and butter programs like universal child care and student loan forgiveness will appeal to people in both parties who are struggling to get by is she too radical for the party michael dukakis the party s 1988 candidate said in an interview no this is basic democratic stuff dukakis said that when he ran against george h w bush wealth inequality was nowhere near

this article is more than 4 years old alberto fernandez s economic minister wants a two year moratorium on debt payments can wall street trust him knowing that his second in command is cristina kirchner photo by amilcar orfali getty images getty images argentina s new government wants a two year breather on its yawning 56 billion foreign dollar denominated debt mostly all of it owed to the international monetary fund will investors be able to trust this new government to improve the economy enough to make payments starting in 2021 if they do not trust it then they will not agree to the moratorium and once again argentina is at risk of default no one but a vulture fund will want to touch it anyone who invested in argentina during the presidency of mauricio macri who leaves office on december 10 was happy to receive roughly 8 in annual interest payments the money wasn t a gift the debt was also used by the argentine government hardly run by poor men and women who can t afford the shoes on their feet to keep the state functioning that means paying public workers too no government money no government jobs on friday new york economist martin guzman was tapped to be new president alberto fernandez s economic minister the market was waiting for this announcement his plan for revitalizing the economy is dependent on a two year loan deferment for money owed to bondholders and the imf the moratorium avoids haircuts on bond principal but may or may not include lower interest rates in order to make the debt more affordable as it is now the imf loan to argentina a record breaker is unpayable guzman said that he wanted a plan to be approved by march and herein lies the rub if it is not approved nobody gets paid argentina will default most of the talk has been around the need for the imf to endorse the guzman proposal in order to assure a friendly deal with bondlords in new york and london none of this sounds realistic says siobhan morden fixed income analyst for latin america at amherst pierpont securities she thinks any debt restructuring plan would only be possible if views were aligned on how argentina plans to pay it back in the first place the outgoing macri administration did not bring argentinians the planned prosperity they had voted for so they have chosen fernandez and his vice president cristina kirchner to give them some relief that relief will come in the form of subsidies and price controls on everything from the currency to gasoline current market prices for argentina s 100 year bond are vulnerable to the downside on the risk that guzman s plan fails coupled with the reality of an economy going nowhere and an electorate demanding more spending after venezuela argentina is south america s sorriest economy kirchner s return to power albeit as second fiddle shows a country that has no ideas left and no fresh leadership photo by spencer platt getty images getty images as of november 30 argentina s treasury deposits were around 700 million at the central bank with four times that owed to creditors in the near term sovereign dollar debt repayments are not overly onerous at 4 4 billion next year and another 2 3 billion for state owned companies against the current 14 4 billion of liquid foreign currency reserves which is an improvement from september reserves the real problem comes in 2022 when some 23 billion is owed to the imf while the selection of guzman as economy minister sends a clear signal of fernandez s endorsement of his view to defer debt payments out to 2022 rather than default how this gets sold to argentina s investors falls on the president martin guzman was designated as economy minister by argentina s president elect alberto fernandez on friday photo by juan mabromata afp via getty images afp via getty images the president elect once in office will fill in the colors of guzman s outline erase what he decides won t fly and will set up contingency plans if the necessary agreements are not reached by march or whenever fernandez decides is the deadline says kevin ivers vice president at dci group in washington a political risk consultancy working with investors many are focused on guzman s ties to economist and ex world banker joseph stiglitz rumors in argentina that stiglitz will help guzman lobby the imf to accept the debt deferment are largely a distraction says ivers anyone who understands argentina will give the same advice keep your eye on the ball and the ball is alberto fernandez it is not about what pressures philosophies or influences guzman brings to the table it s about what alberto faces inside the tribe of peronism he says of argentina s main political ideology of course a main ring leader in that tribe is his own vice president cristina kirchner who many believe is at least partially responsible for the mess argentina is in today cristina a two term president practically closed argentina s economy for a number of years making it harder for multinational companies to repatriate money back to the u s and elsewhere she also artificially inflated the value of the peso installed numerous capital controls and subsidized the heck out of the economy when macri tried taking that away he was met with resistance from unions and had to back off unable to make the fiscal changes to the economy he brought in the imf for help by his last year in office he was no different than cristina back to using price controls in an effort to curb inflation argentina is a quasi socialist economy surviving on the heavily dollarized portions of the economy real estate tourism commodity exports and wine fernandez must balance all the governors the argentina industrial union brazil president and major trading partner jair bolsonaro his apparent love of regional left wing mischief and says ivers his need for donald trump s good favor the u s has the biggest position in the imf and the most votes with 16 5 of the total that s nearly triple china another important argentina ally and eight times that of brazil if fernandez is going to play footsies with venezuela s ruling socialists united and promote chile style social unrest in brazil along with his friend and ex convict luiz inacio lula da silva then it gives washington little incentive to save an economy run by those working against its interests buena suerte argentina
trump s top economic advisor larry kudlow has hinted that another supposed middle class tax cut may be in the works a tax cut 2 0 to be delivered surprise surprise in time for the 2020 election season an bare naked ploy to try to convince average americans he really cares about and their economic interests as the saying goes buyer beware or as george w bush famously put it fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you can t get fooled again remember the tax cuts and job act of 2017 while most americans did it turns out very likely receive some tax benefit they didn t even feel its effect for the most part why well 60 percent of the total savings of the legislation went to the top 20 percent of earners while the top 1 percent were gifted 17 percent of all the tax cut dollars these numbers don t even account for the enormous dollars dropped on corporations when their tax rate was slashed from 35 to 21 percent a cut that further benefited the very wealthy disproportionately since they own the most stock to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily what was left the middle fifth of income earners paid about 780 less in taxes less than 70 per month and an even smaller and not so noticeable amount per paycheck was there a larger benefit though did the tax cut lead as promised to economic growth the short answer nope in fact the united states lost more tax revenue than any other nation in the organisation for economic co operation and development as the nation s tax to gdp ratio fell 2 5 percent from 2017 to 2018 these tax cuts benefited the wealthy and did not trickle down despite trump s promises that companies would invest in workers and not cut jobs companies like at t wells fargo and general motors lobbied for them promising to re invest their tax savings in their workers and companies to the benefit off the nation as a whole and yet all of these companies have engaged in massive layoffs or plant closings at t has eliminated over 23 000 jobs since the tax cuts went into effect despite receiving a 21 billion windfall from the tax cuts with the prospect of cashing in an additional 3 billion annually in tax savings in november 2018 gm announced it would be closing five plants eliminating 14 000 jobs in communities across ohio maryland michigan and ontario canada while buying back 10 billion in stock and earning a net profit of 8 billion on which the company paid no federal tax wells fargo did raise the minimum wage of its employees though the tax savings for the company were 47 times larger than the cost of that pay raise to the company and the company announced its plans in september 2018 to eliminate 26 000 jobs at the same time that it has raised health insurance costs for its employees reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent and saving corporations some 13 billion in taxes was supposedly to spur economic growth create more jobs and induce companies to raise wages while treasury secretary steve mnuchin trumpeted that 90 percent of working adults would experience an increase in pay tied directly to the tax cuts in fact only 4 3 percent of workers in fortune 500 companies have received either a one time bonus or an increase in wages businesses have reaped nine times more in tax cuts than what they have passed on to workers so is this latest tax cut scheme an honest bid to really bestow a meaningful tax cut on the middle class and not use the rhetoric of tax cuts as a distraction a sleight of hand while resources are diverted to the wealthiest among us well remember what bush said you can t get fooled again the whispers thus far about this rumored tax cut 2 0 suggest the plan is to reduce the 22 percent marginal tax rate to 15 percent according to reporting by cnbc s sarah o brien daniel bunn director of global projects for the tax foundation an independent tax policy research group concluded that actually wouldn t do much of anything to cut taxes for the middle class what would help most americans actually building up the nation s tax base as lost tax revenues and ballooning deficits finally translate into cuts to services and infrastructure upon which we have come to depend such as our public schools and universities our healthcare our roads our energy grids our water supplies and so forth and studies show that americans are more interested in policy that require all americans and corporations to contribute their fair share in taxes than they are in receiving tax cuts disinvestment in vital services institutions and infrastructure ends up costing taxpayers more in the short and long terms and we receive less for our tax dollars when increasing portions of those dollars go to service debt trump s tax cut 2 0 should it come to fruition would be a ploy to get himself re elected so he can avail himself of the office for another four years of enriching himself as the expense of the american people

by w a wijewardena damage control exercise by finance ministry in a background of some contrasting signals from various parties regarding the generous tax cuts introduced by the government the finance ministry has attempted to do a damage control exercise by issuing a press notice last week the confusion was on its short and medium term outcome specifically how it would serve as a stimulus package cabinet co spokesperson dr bandula gunawardane hailing the new tax cuts asserted among others that it would in fact leave more cash in the hands of both individuals and businesses enabling them to overcome the economic hardships they had been undergoing for some time the public at large welcomed it because they thought that they would have more cash to spend the business sector including the chambers watched the developments cautiously without making a too quick judgment at the same time moody s rating services branded the stimulus package as credit negative implying that it would lead to a downgrading of the country s present rating of b1 stable unless it is managed properly fitch rating warned that the stimulus package would derail the budget disciplining exercise started by the previous government a similar view was opined by imf s sri lanka country head too in a similar note the outgoing central bank governor dr indrajit coomaraswamy has indicated that the stimulus should not undermine the debt sustainability exercise being carried out by the government the world bank s chief economist for south asia hans timmer delivering a public lecture at the central bank s centre for banking studies was more polite in expressing his concerns he said that though there may be reason for fiscal stimulus there is no space for it in sri lanka and the policy makers should strike a proper balance between fiscal stimulus and the need for preventing the overheating of the economy a situation where the aggregate demand rising faster than the aggregate supply what it means is that if sri lanka s potential growth is low stimulating the economy either through fiscal policy or through monetary policy would simply increase the demand causing the prices to increase and the exchange rate to fall bothe these outcomes are what the government wants to prevent from happening at any cost meanwhile sri lanka sovereign bonds maturing in 2027 and 2028 witnessed a fall in market prices by about 4 us cents raising market interest rates from 6 8 to 8 against these contrasting signals finance ministry to its credit has assured that the programme to consolidate the budget will not be halted and the government will stick to its budgetary targets by cutting down the unnecessary expenses it had also reiterated that it would continue to negotiate with imf to save the present extended fund facility or eff of which the final instalment is due to be released in mid 2020 the irrelevant laffer curve for sri lanka as pronounced by the cabinet co spokesperson dr gunawardane the rationale for the tax cuts has been to lower the rates and rope in more taxpayers so that the overall revenue of the government would increase over the time this logic is indeed in line with what is known as the laffer curve named after the american economist arthur laffer according to laffer there is an optimal income tax rate up to which the revenue will increase and if the rate shoots over that optimal rate revenue will begin to fall hence when a country is in the revenue falling region the reduction of the income tax rate would certainly increase revenue instead of reducing it empirical studies have shown that this optimal income tax rate stands at around 70 for most of the countries sri lanka s marginal income tax rate is just 24 and therefore it has not yet reached the level of taxation that prompts an increase in revenue if the rate is cut hence it is not the laffer curve which may have prompted sri lankan authorities to cut tax rates but some other consideration that is to provide an additional income to the hands of the taxpayers catch more liable people into the tax net and increase the tax revenue by getting more people to pay taxes this last goal had been expressly mentioned in the election manifesto according to press reports the tax cut is intended to address both the individual taxpayers and the corporate taxpayers promised relief to individuals may backfire in the case of individuals the presently available tax free allowance of rs 1 2 million in two slots namely rs 700 000 for employment income and rs 500 000 for non employment income will be increased to rs 3 million the applicable marginal tax rate will be reduced from the current 24 to 18 at the same time the advance tax collection mechanisms involving the pay as you earn or paye out of employment income and the withholding taxes or whts on interest dividend and non employment income at 5 at source will be abolished all these are final taxes at present and therefore once they are abolished all individual taxpayers are required to pay income tax on those incomes too provided the total income is higher than rs 250 000 per month or rs 3 million per annum the applicable tax rates are 6 on the first rs 250 000 12 on the next rs 250 000 and 18 on the balance the current timeline introduced by the inland revenue department or ird is to pay the due tax at the end of every quarter and make a final adjustment tax payment at the end of the year hence individual taxpayers who receive both employment and non employment income will have to make the due tax payment to ird quarterly according to the current law it is mandatory for every taxpayer to inform ird in advance the estimated tax liability in every quarter and pay the taxes accordingly hence the abolition of paye and whts will pass the burden of remitting the due taxes to ird from employers banks and other payment agencies to individual taxpayers in the case of employers and so on the payment software used by them have already been adjusted to deduct these taxes and remit to ird hence it is not a burden for them to make those payments however the individual taxpayers especially those of the small retail type will have to make an extra effort to meet the tax payment obligations in time expansion of vat coverage with regard to businesses the most explosive tax cut has been for the value added tax or vat that tax had been introduced as an improvement to the business turnover tax or btt which had reigned the country s indirect taxes since the early 1960s btt was a multi stage tax which taxed businesses again and again when they moved from one stage of production to another for instance consider the tyre industry assume that it has four stages of production just for clarity of explanation rubber manufacturing as a raw material wholesale trading of rubber tyre manufacturing and retailing those tyres to final users if input rubber worth of rs 100 is sold by wholesalers to tyre manufacturers for rs 150 and the tyre manufacturer converts it to a tyre worth of rs 200 and the retailer sells it to the final user for rs 250 a btt of 10 would impose taxes in the following manner causing higher prices for each of the users in the production and consumption chain the rubber producer rs 10 which is added to the price which he charges to the wholesaler the latter prices it at rs 160 charging a btt of rs 16 from the tyre manufacturer his price is not rs 200 but rs 216 over which he collects a btt of rs 21 60 from the retailer by adding it to the price the retailer s buying price is now rs 237 60 and comes up with a selling price of rs 287 60 over which he collects a btt of rs 28 76 from the final user accordingly the price payable by the final user is rs 316 26 the total btt collected by the government is rs 76 36 if it is a value added tax of 10 it is equivalent to a tax on the final product which is simply rs 25 because of this position if the governments are to earn a higher tax revenue they have to adopt a multitude of strategies that was what each successive government did in the past increasing the rate expanding the number of vat payers by lowering the turnover limit to rs 12 million per annum for eligibility and bringing more economic activities under its base will vat changes help the government it in fact did the trick and the revenue increased from rs 171 billion in 2009 to an estimated rs 600 billion in 2019 the yield also increased from 3 5 of gdp to 4 of gdp during this period from the government s point vat has therefore been an efficient tax however more tax revenue means more resentment by taxpayers the present government appears to have yielded to that resentment and introduced a sweeping change to vat thus the rate has been reduced from 15 to 8 with the exception of vat on banking insurance and financial services at the same time the eligibility threshold of turnover has been increased from rs 12 billion per annum to rs 300 billion taking out a large number of small businesses from the tax net it is not a relief to businesses but a relief to consumers since vat being an indirect tax is supposed to be passed on to the latter in addition condominium property has been exempted from vat while tourism sector businesses have been exempted for five years provided they increase the use of local inputs to 60 of their revenue the former will boost condominium sales which are not doing well due to general economic slowdown the latter will not help tourism sector businesses since vat is as a general rule passed onto the tourists it will therefore reduce the costs of tourists and encourage them to seek sri lanka as a tourist destination thus it could have been implemented as an incentive for tourists without bringing the 60 input requirement into it the revenue loss due to vat reduction is estimated to be around rs 300 billion in 2020 relief to businesses the other business related tax cuts are the abolition of economic services charge or esc nation building tax or nbt and the capital gains tax or cgt the telecommunication levy which stands at 15 now has been cut by a fourth so that new levy rate becomes 11 25 it is not a revenue earning by the government but by the telecommunication regulatory authority or trc further the debt repayment levy which had been imposed on banking and financial institutions as a way to get their support to repay debt has been abolished there have been production related tax cuts as well accordingly income from agriculture fishing and livestock has been exempted from income tax similarly income from information technology or it enabling services has also been exempted from taxes professional income being received by sri lankans in foreign exchange and interest income on foreign currency deposits have also been exempted from income tax the estimated loss in revenue based on the estimated revenue of the government in 2019 from the taxes which have been abolished or reduced the immediate loss of revenue to the government ranges between rs 650 billion and rs 680 billion this loss amounts to a third of the government revenue or about 4 of gdp in the medium term a part of this could be recovered by roping in more taxpayers into the tax net but in the short term the government will have to raise these funds by borrowing from the market after increasing the government s borrowing limits through parliament but when such a large amount is put on the market there will be pressure for interest rates to rise defeating the government s objective of keeping interest rates below 10 the immediate jump in the interest rates could be avoided if the same is borrowed from the central bank but it would amount to increasing the money supply putting pressure for domestic prices to increase and exchange rate to depreciate it thus will defeat the government s objective of keeping inflation below 5 and strengthening the exchange rate this is a policy paradox which brings in harmful outcomes whatever the course of action the policy makers would be taking the plight of individual taxpayers the abolition of the paye tax and the wht on interest and non employment income will have a dubious effect on individual taxpayers at present the paye tax collected at the time of earning income and wht collected at 5 at source are considered as final tax payments hence after they are abolished the individual taxpayers are required to indicate them in the annual tax returns and pay taxes at the normal tax rates if they have a tax file or open up a file and pay taxes if they do not have a tax file provided the amalgamation of incomes from all these three sources exceed the minimum tax free allowance of rs 3 million there is a relief by way of a reduction in the marginal tax rate from 24 to 18 however this relief is being subsumed by two factors one is the addition of two income sources which had been declared as final tax payments earlier to income which is now subject to income tax the other is the reduction of the tax slabs from rs 600 000 earlier to rs 250 000 now as a result even at lower rates a taxpayer will have to pay more now compared to the previous system it would in fact increase the total tax income as expected by the government conditions for success the success of the present tax reduction in raising revenue in the medium term will therefore depend on the efficiency of the inland revenue department in roping in more taxpayers and collecting taxes from them with the new revenue administration management information system or ramis and the arrangement to pay taxes through lankapay operated by lankaclear it is not a serious issue for ird to upgrade its systems and handle more tax files with the available human resource base but it takes time and unless it is handled carefully the stimulus package will backfire causing a large gap in the budgetary financing avoiding this pitfall should be the topmost priority of the gotabaya rajapaksa administration the writer a former deputy governor of the central bank of sri lanka can be reached at waw1949 gmail com
damage control exercise by finance ministry in a background of some contrasting signals from various parties regarding the generous tax cuts introduced by the government the finance ministry has attempted to do a damage control exercise by issuing a press notice last week the confusion was on its short and medium term outcome specifically how it would serve as a stimulus package cabinet co spokesperson dr bandula gunawardena hailing the new tax cuts asserted among others that it would in fact leave more cash in the hands of both individuals and businesses enabling them to overcome the economic hardships they had been undergoing for some time the public at large welcomed it because they thought that they would have more cash to spend the business sector including the chambers watched the developments cautiously without making a too quick judgment at the same time moody s rating services branded the stimulus package as credit negative implying that it would lead to a downgrading of the country s present rating of b1 stable unless it is managed properly fitch rating warned that the stimulus package would derail the budget disciplining exercise started by the previous government a similar view was opined by imf s sri lanka country head too in a similar note the outgoing central bank governor dr indrajit coomaraswamy has indicated that the stimulus should not undermine the debt sustainability exercise being carried out by the government the world bank s chief economist for south asia hans timmer delivering a public lecture at the central bank s centre for banking studies was more polite in expressing his concerns he said that though there may be reason for fiscal stimulus there is no space for it in sri lanka and the policy makers should strike a proper balance between fiscal stimulus and the need for preventing the overheating of the economy a situation where the aggregate demand rising faster than the aggregate supply what it means is that if sri lanka s potential growth is low stimulating the economy either through fiscal policy or through monetary policy would simply increase the demand causing the prices to increase and the exchange rate to fall bothe these outcomes are what the government wants to prevent from happening at any cost meanwhile sri lanka sovereign bonds maturing in 2027 and 2028 witnessed a fall in market prices by about 4 us cents raising market interest rates from 6 8 to 8 against these contrasting signals finance ministry to its credit has assured that the programme to consolidate the budget will not be halted and the government will stick to its budgetary targets by cutting down the unnecessary expenses it had also reiterated that it would continue to negotiate with imf to save the present extended fund facility or eff of which the final instalment is due to be released in mid 2020 the irrelevant laffer curve for sri lanka as pronounced by the cabinet co spokesperson dr gunawardena the rationale for the tax cuts has been to lower the rates and rope in more taxpayers so that the overall revenue of the government would increase over the time this logic is indeed in line with what is known as the laffer curve named after the american economist arthur laffer according to laffer there is an optimal income tax rate up to which the revenue will increase and if the rate shoots over that optimal rate revenue will begin to fall hence when a country is in the revenue falling region the reduction of the income tax rate would certainly increase revenue instead of reducing it empirical studies have shown that this optimal income tax rate stands at around 70 for most of the countries sri lanka s marginal income tax rate is just 24 and therefore it has not yet reached the level of taxation that prompts an increase in revenue if the rate is cut hence it is not the laffer curve which may have prompted sri lankan authorities to cut tax rates but some other consideration that is to provide an additional income to the hands of the taxpayers catch more liable people into the tax net and increase the tax revenue by getting more people to pay taxes this last goal had been expressly mentioned in the election manifesto according to press reports the tax cut is intended to address both the individual taxpayers and the corporate taxpayers promised relief to individuals may backfire in the case of individuals the presently available tax free allowance of rs 1 2 million in two slots namely rs 700 000 for employment income and rs 500 000 for non employment income will be increased to rs 3 million the applicable marginal tax rate will be reduced from the current 24 to 18 at the same time the advance tax collection mechanisms involving the pay as you earn or paye out of employment income and the withholding taxes or whts on interest dividend and non employment income at 5 at source will be abolished all these are final taxes at present and therefore once they are abolished all individual taxpayers are required to pay income tax on those incomes too provided the total income is higher than rs 250 000 per month or rs 3 million per annum the applicable tax rates are 6 on the first rs 250 000 12 on the next rs 250 000 and 18 on the balance the current timeline introduced by the inland revenue department or ird is to pay the due tax at the end of every quarter and make a final adjustment tax payment at the end of the year hence individual taxpayers who receive both employment and non employment income will have to make the due tax payment to ird quarterly according to the current law it is mandatory for every taxpayer to inform ird in advance the estimated tax liability in every quarter and pay the taxes accordingly hence the abolition of paye and whts will pass the burden of remitting the due taxes to ird from employers banks and other payment agencies to individual taxpayers in the case of employers and so on the payment software used by them have already been adjusted to deduct these taxes and remit to ird hence it is not a burden for them to make those payments however the individual taxpayers especially those of the small retail type will have to make an extra effort to meet the tax payment obligations in time expansion of vat coverage with regard to businesses the most explosive tax cut has been for the value added tax or vat that tax had been introduced as an improvement to the business turnover tax or btt which had reigned the country s indirect taxes since the early 1960s btt was a multi stage tax which taxed businesses again and again when they moved from one stage of production to another for instance consider the tyre industry assume that it has four stages of production just for clarity of explanation rubber manufacturing as a raw material wholesale trading of rubber tyre manufacturing and retailing those tyres to final users if input rubber worth of rs 100 is sold by wholesalers to tyre manufacturers for rs 150 and the tyre manufacturer converts it to a tyre worth of rs 200 and the retailer sells it to the final user for rs 250 a btt of 10 would impose taxes in the following manner causing higher prices for each of the users in the production and consumption chain the rubber producer rs 10 which is added to the price which he charges to the wholesaler the latter prices it at rs 160 charging a btt of rs 16 from the tyre manufacturer his price is not rs 200 but rs 216 over which he collects a btt of rs 21 60 from the retailer by adding it to the price the retailer s buying price is now rs 237 60 and comes up with a selling price of rs 287 60 over which he collects a btt of rs 28 76 from the final user accordingly the price payable by the final user is rs 316 26 the total btt collected by the government is rs 76 36 if it is a value added tax of 10 it is equivalent to a tax on the final product which is simply rs 25 because of this position if the governments are to earn a higher tax revenue they have to adopt a multitude of strategies that was what each successive government did in the past increasing the rate expanding the number of vat payers by lowering the turnover limit to rs 12 million per annum for eligibility and bringing more economic activities under its base will vat changes help the government it in fact did the trick and the revenue increased from rs 171 billion in 2009 to an estimated rs 600 billion in 2019 the yield also increased from 3 5 of gdp to 4 of gdp during this period from the government s point vat has therefore been an efficient tax however more tax revenue means more resentment by taxpayers the present government appears to have yielded to that resentment and introduced a sweeping change to vat thus the rate has been reduced from 15 to 8 with the exception of vat on banking insurance and financial services at the same time the eligibility threshold of turnover has been increased from rs 12 billion per annum to rs 300 billion taking out a large number of small businesses from the tax net it is not a relief to businesses but a relief to consumers since vat being an indirect tax is supposed to be passed on to the latter in addition condominium property has been exempted from vat while tourism sector businesses have been exempted for five years provided they increase the use of local inputs to 60 of their revenue the former will boost condominium sales which are not doing well due to general economic slowdown the latter will not help tourism sector businesses since vat is as a general rule passed onto the tourists it will therefore reduce the costs of tourists and encourage them to seek sri lanka as a tourist destination thus it could have been implemented as an incentive for tourists without bringing the 60 input

this article is more than 4 years old getty if i had a dollar for every time my clients and students told me in 2008 2012 that derivatives markets would collapse from the weight of new financial regulation i would be a billionaire now despite regulations and new standards enacted in the group of 20 countries beginning in 2009 global derivatives markets are larger than ever according to the analysis and data in the bank for international settlements quarterly released today daily foreign exchange volumes are 6 6 trillion spot forwards and options trading in foreign exchange markets has risen almost 30 from the last foreign exchange survey in 2016 and 560 from when i worked in the foreign exchange group of the federal reserve bank of new york in the early 1990s daily interest rate derivatives trading has also soared and is now 6 5 trillion in comparison exports of goods and services globally were less than 100 billion per day in 2018 bank for international settlements market participants should be aware that the global foreign exchange market is much less transparent than many other financial markets such as the fixed income and equity markets because it is organized as an over the counter otc market built upon credit relationships as andreas schrimpf and vladyslav sushko of the bis explain in sizing up global foreign exchange markets in recent years changes in market structure such as the internalisation of trades in dealers proprietary liquidity pools further reduced the share of trading activity thatis visible to other market participants the triennial survey provides a comprehensive albeit infrequent snapshot of activity in this highly fragmented market bank for international settlements in 2019 the bis foreign exchange and interest rate derivative data comes from almost 1 300 dealers mainly banks located in 53 countries foreign exchange transactions have grown enormously due to the growing economy in the u s chasing higher returns because of a very low interest rate environment the increase of nonbanks in derivatives markets and the advent of electronic and automated trading bank for international settlements the increase in foreign exchange turnover between 2016 and 2019 is particularly evident in offshore markets there is also an increase in geographical concentration in foreign exchange trading london new york singapore and hong kong sar increased their collective share of foreign exchange global trading to 75 in april 2019 up from 71 in 2016 and 65 in 2010 trading in otc interest rate derivatives markets was also increasingly concentrated in those few financial centers especially london bank for international settlements banks continue to be the largest participants in foreign exchange markets the largest global dealers in the world are banks like bank of america citibank deutsche bank goldman sachs jpmorgan and morgan stanley inter dealer trading accounts for 47 of all foreign exchange swap turnover bank for international settlements while foreign exchange trading with institutional clients has declined trading with nonbanks has grown substantially shrimpf s and shushko s detailed analysis shows that dealers trading with other financial institutions a category that includes nonreporting banks hedge funds and ptfs institutional investors and official sector financial institutions grew notably since 2016 by 1 trillion to 3 6 trillion this is a 260 rise in just three years many of these nonbanks use algorithmic trading strategies that use instruments featuring a high degree of electronification especially spot and most recently forwards while having the heterogeneity of counterparties in foreign exchange can be very good to reduce banks counterparty concentration it is important for traders and investors to remember many of these nonbanks are not regulated and examined the way that banks and insurance companies are hence the level of capital that they allocate to sustain unexpected losses from derivatives can be considerably less shrimpf and shushko remind us that the entire industry was jolted on 15 january 2015 when the swiss franc moved by an intraday maximum of 39 against the euro after the swiss national bank abandoned its exchange rate ceiling although they recovered by the end of the day key chf exchange rate crosses against usd and eur moved by as much as 12 standard deviations on that day the shockwaves were felt in all corners of global fx markets prime brokers risk management models were simply not set up to take into account such an extreme tail event individual losses to banks providing pb services to specialised retail fx margin brokers were in the hundreds of millions bank for international settlements this means that systemic regulators around the world such as the federal stability oversight council fsoc in the u s should collect spot and derivatives data from nonbanks many of which are quite opaque to measure the risks posed by all derivatives and foreign exchange spot transactions systemic regulators should also ask probing questions about these firms risk management practices while nonbanks do not hold deposits they are incredibly interconnected to banks through loans funding facilities repurchase agreements and derivatives bank for international settlements emerging market currency trading grew more rapidly than trading of the u s dollar euro and the japanese yen bis data shows that the share of emerging market currencies in global foreign exchange turnover rose to 23 in april 2019 in comparison with 19 in 2016 and 15 in 2013 in these markets in addition to the counterparty risk that participants globally should be measuring and monitoring investors should be more attuned to the volatility and illiquidity of many emerging market currencies bank for international settlements while notional amounts do not tell us the credit or market risks that these instruments represent to traders and investors the continued rise of derivatives should compel regulators legislators and journalists investigate how companies and financial institutions using derivatives establish robust risk management practices this involves having highly qualified professionals who can identify measure control and monitor the counterparty market and liquidity risks of these instruments 24 7 especially at internationally active companies and financial institutions the more derivatives transactions increase the more demands there are at companies and financial institutions to improve the relevant data that they need to price derivatives and to measure their risks accurately rising transactions also puts pressures on companies technological systems unfortunately we have plenty of financial institutions such as allied irish barings bear sterns daiwa jpmorgan lehman société générale and ubs which have suffered significant financial losses and in some cases imploded when risk management around derivatives trading failed spectacularly
montpelier for about an hour lawmakers and policy experts gathered at the pavilion building to hear a comprehensive report by legislative economist tom kavet on the state of the vermont economy and how it fits into the larger national trends i don t think at this point we are seeing huge changes in what we would expect by the end of the fiscal year so revenue is pretty much on track kavet said he continued by noting revenues are up significantly the strongest area of the general fund is personal income tax revenues they are up maybe 2 to 3 percent above targets while the presentation generally acknowledged that the economy is in an upswing at no point was president donald trump given credit for the booming national economy and stock market secretary of administration susanne young told true north last week that personal income tax revenues are up 4 2 percent for the year and in 2018 the first year after the gop led tax cuts were implemented they were up 6 5 percent despite all time highs in federal revenue since those tax cuts kavet spent much of his presentation assessing the potential for a major economic downfall massive deficit spending via unfunded tax cuts have also pumped the economy but with longer term costs as the national debt has soured at a time in the business cycle it would be expected to recede he said this could limit counter cyclical fiscal policy in the event of another recession kavet said the biggest risk to the continued economic expansion is trump s trade war with china it s clearly the trade wars he said it s very difficult to know where we re at at any point in time a lot of it has been conducted by tweet and so far it s lowered exports and imports but not created more domestic production kavet continued to break down all the different facets that play into the health of the state and national economy for instance he explained how the federal reserve money printing policy is affecting housing prices there s been a series of quick drops in interest rates and that has had and housing prices are again picking up he said we re seeing a lot more of existing home sales we re seeing other credit sensitive sectors doing better and so that s been something of a life line kavet pointed to a survey of 75 economists by the wall street journal in which a third of them predict a recession by next year and 100 percent predict one before 2025 as far as consumer confidence is concerned interpretation of the data depends largely on party affiliation kavet said those that are republican are way more optimistic than those that are democrats he said and the independents tend to be very close to about halfway in between kavet made an observation about minimum wage laws and how that impacts real wages he said while new hampshire has no state minimum wage which defaults to the federal minimum wage of 7 25 an hour for the most part it hasn t made a big difference from vermont where the state minimum is set to rise to 10 96 on jan 1 there are very few jobs that are below the vermont minimum wage in new hampshire because the prevailing market wage is a lot higher he said he added that while vermont wages are jumping about 3 percent per year that s still relatively low when considering the state s unemployment is at a record low 2 2 percent joint fiscal office chief fiscal officer steven klein who also spoke at the meeting gave a broad overview of the state s revenue versus expense situation he said progress is being made on increased revenue and fewer deficits but increasing retirement obligations for teachers and state employees is a looming problem it s going to take a fairly steep effort to try and ensure that we pay those down he said for example 145 million of the 2018 general fund went to teachers retirement young said last week these costs are more than offsetting increased revenue all the programs that we have just to fund them at our current service levels we still have a gap even with this good news and this surplus she said klein presented pie charts breaking down total expenditures and education continues to be the biggest piece totaling 2 billion or about a third of the entire 6 1 fiscal year 2020 budget the next biggest piece is medicaid funding at just over 1 8 billion the next two big spending items are transportation and human services at about 600 million each michael bielawski is a reporter for true north reports send him news tips at bielawski82 yahoo com and follow him on twitter truenorthmikeb image courtesy of michael bielawski tnr
reasons behind currency devaluation by brazil argentina sobral rejects the idea that currency fluctuations in brazil and argentina are hurting american farmers who are actually being struck by chinese retaliation measures amid trump s protracted trade war with beijing commenting on trump s vocal discontent with the peso and real devaluation the academic highlights that the latin american economies high unemployment rates indebtedness and deep recession have prompted them to resort to the measure however according to him the exchange rate variations in brazil and argentina are of different natures argentina has collapsed in repayment of its international commitments then a loan has been made to the imf and this loan is what has ensured that these payments are due he points out there is widespread suspicion about the peso that has been devalued by the international currency market due to the conclusion that the argentine government is unable to honour its external commitments it is a classic crisis of mistrust in the currency and not the result of an argentine government action to devalue sobral foresees that the trump administration will not make it easier for argentina s new left leaning government according to the academic washington is interested in sabotaging the alberto fernandez cabinet with tariffs in order to prevent the economy from recovering on the other hand the devaluation of brazil s currency is caused by a huge leakage of dollars mainly from the stock market big investors are withdrawing shares of brazilian companies leaving the local stock exchanges he underscores the central bank of brazil has been working to prevent the devaluation of the brazilian currency by selling dollars from its foreign exchange reserves the academic says there is a speculative movement and that large transactions in the currency market have given huge profits to people who are enjoying this mechanism he highlights that the country s central bank is consciously or unconsciously favouring mega international speculators new protectionist era is opening according to sobral there s a profound change in the us policy under trump who is apparently seeking to return to a pre theodore roosevelt closed american economy donald trump is moving away from the idea of trade globalisation led by the world trade organisation protectionism becomes the norm in relations between the united states and other countries he needs to ensure an increasingly closed market for jobs to be kept internally he doesn t care much about income distribution he wants to keep jobs and the level of domestic economic activity trump s logic is to achieve increasingly favourable trade agreements to maintain growth and ensure re election the professor elaborates the academic believes that the current situation is largely a consequence of the 2008 crisis in which the markets of each country is becoming increasingly closed and in greater dispute
george soros a former partner for 9 plus years unparalleled success was predicated on his uncanny ability to recognize a new trend before anyone else add to his position over time often using leverage as long as he believed it was not fully recognized by others and then selling the position when it was recognized by others and selling at full value naturally he was quick to reverse his view if he felt he was wrong we at paix et prospã ritã have the same philosophy however we are primarily stock investors rather than buying selling futures options on stocks indices currencies and commodities as george did we combine both a top down global perspective analyzing economic monetary fiscal trade and regulatory policies by region combined with a bottom up stock specific approach to investing utilizing our independent research we do hedge our portfolios if we deem it prudent and as we have said before our long term record of outperformance speaks for itself as you know we turned bearish last year when the fed tightened policy way too much jeopardizing our economy while trump was tweeting incessantly about trade tariffs against any country most notably china that was not trading on a level playing field with us and stealing our ip however we shifted our stance at the end of last december after the fed finally reversed its monetary stance easing policy lowering rates and acknowledging that it would do all in its power to sustain the economic expansion while trying to raise the inflation rate up to its 2 target we wrote many times this year that all monetary authorities globally were now overly accommodative providing more liquidity to the system than was needed by the global economy such that the excess liquidity would move into financial assets thereby increasing prices for stocks and bonds while forcing investors further out on the risk curve we recognize that there is a lag time between monetary authorities easing policy and the global economy responding by expanding once again this was further complicated by a sharp slowdown in global trade such that the countries relying on exports production like china germany and japan suffered much more than the countries like the u s who were much more reliant on consumption it also helped the u s that trump added tremendous fiscal stimulus and regulatory reforms to our economy whereas germany and japan had refused to budge china s economy was hurt the most as its economy was so reliant on production exports and the shift to consumption was just in its early years our portfolios were concentrated domestically in defensive stocks with yields far above the 10 and even 30 year treasury rates the u s was by far the best safest house on the block to invest in we began to shift our view 8 weeks ago when we recognized that the global economy was nearing an inflection point such that growth was finally basing and would begin to accelerate as we entered 2020 therefore we slowly began to transition our portfolios to more economically sensitive stocks domiciled in the u s selling at recession valuations with above average yields generating significant free cash flow while also shrinking their market capitalizations technology was then and remains today the largest area of concentration in our portfolios as corporations would invest in it earning a significant return on their tech investments while enhancing their competitive position beside our view that all this excess monetary creation would find its way into financial risk assets we held firmly to our belief that the stock market multiple would trend up over time to 20 times earnings moving above the historic trend of 13 to 17 times earnings as interest rates were 300 600 basis points below their historic norm while bank capital liquidity ratios risk were moving well above historic highs too we eventually became far less concerned about trade tariffs conflicts recognizing that most of the tariffs were eaten by the overseas manufacturers the strength of the dollar and supply chain movements these trends core beliefs were and remain our friend as we are more convinced today that the global economy is bottoming out and 2020 will be a better year trade is far less a problem to the u s than perceived with china at risk as its economy continues to weaken thereby jeopardizing china 2025 putting the u s in the driver s seat due to the inherent strength of our economy bolstered by strong consumer demand and tremendous fiscal stimulus global monetary policy remaining overly accommodative in excess of economic needs therefore boosting the value of financial assets while forcing investors further out on the risk curve low inflation is not transitory due to global competition technological advancements and disruptors everywhere stocks market multiples will trend higher over time as the fed investors become more convinced that low inflation is here to stay such that interest rates will remain 300 600 basis points below their historic norms with bank capital liquidity ratios remaining at all time highs most corporations are running lean and mean with dividend yields above the 10 and 30 year government bond rates while generating large amounts of free cash flow investors are significantly over weighted bonds just as the yield curve has begun to steepen and under weighted equities even after the 20 advance this year let s take a look again at the four key issues that investors are focused on trade monetary policy brexit and trump trade we believe that the odds of a phase 1 trade deal continue to increase as evidenced by both the comments and actions out of the u s and china last week china began the process friday of waiving tariffs on imports of u s pork soybeans cotton corn and sorghum let s be clear that china needs our agricultural goods as food inflation has risen out of sight trump on the other hand realizes that the u s is in the catbird seat such that the president said at the nato conference that he may be willing to wait until after elections to finalize a trade deal with china in our opinion china cannot afford to wait running the risk that companies will only accelerate their supply line shifts elsewhere and the democrats if elected may take a more aggressive stance against china especially for environmental reasons coal trump also showed that he is more than willing to use tariffs to combat trade issues he proposed duties of 2 4 billion against french products in retaliation to a french tax against u s tech companies and he also reinstituted tariffs on steel and aluminum from argentina and brazil as he criticized them for cheapening their currencies to the detriment of u s farmers japan s parliament approved the trade deal with the u s monetary policy all of the major monetary bodies continue to support overly accommodative policies ecb president christine lagarde joined fed chairman powell stating that the ecb will be resolute on hitting its 2 inflation mandate good luck by the way the fed pumped another 70 1 billion liquidity into the markets last week brexit it appears that johnson will receive a mandate at this week s upcoming election on 12 10 to pass his brexit bill if not successful we still do not expect a hard brexit as it would hurt both the british and european economies which both can ill afford trump we continue to believe that trump recognizes that he needs a strong economy and stock market to win the election therefore it is doubtful that he will do anything that would jeopardize his chances to win we expect him to propose a new round of tax cuts benefitting the lower and middle classes and pay for it by closing loopholes that benefit only the wealthy an infrastructure plan and a healthcare drug pricing plan now let s take a brief look at the most recent data points that confirm that the u s is doing just fine while other economies continue to struggle however they

bernanke and the fed have put america and the world on a path that mirrors the same unsuccessful path bailing out the very people that caused many of our problems with the government financing almost 40 percent of its annual budget through debt it becomes easy to draw comparisons between greece and japan while adding to the markets move higher across the globe the latest move by prime minister shinzo abe should do little to boost confidence in the small island nation entering the third quarter of 2019 reuters reported their monthly tankan survey showed that japanese manufacturers had again turned pessimistic about business prospects confidence in the service sector also plunged amid the escalating sino u s trade war and problems in china the survey results showed the weakest sentiment reading since april 2013 concerns about weakening global demand intensified after a closely watched bond market indicator pointed tothe u s china trade war in conjunction with japan s export curbs to south korea and the rising yen has put a lid on sales this has stoked the fears of recession and raised questions over how much longer domestic demand can remain resilient enough to offset rising external pressures private consumption constitutes about 60 of the japanese economy adding to the stress is the fact japan s economy is now under pressure from this increase took place on oct 1st the bank of japan has estimated this will generate a net burden of 2 2 trillion yen on households in fiscal 2020 as a result of its economic growth slowing down and slumping to its weakest point in a year this is the first stimulus package in three years and centers on measures to ignite consumer spending by promoting cashless sales and public works spending to bolster infrastructure we have crafted a powerful policy package aimed at helping overcome economic downside risks prime minister shinzo abe said as part of its economic package to spur consumer spending for this the government will set aside about 280 billion yen this would start in september next year say people familiar with the matter the stimulus package also contains public sector spending of 13 2 trillion yen which wouldand strengthening infrastructure to reduce future damage abe s package broadly aims to improve labor conditions support small companies and promote advanced technology development this means the government will increase job training services to help people in their 30s and 40s as well as provide subsidies to small and medium sized companies to spur their capital spending it will also supply more computers to public schools and the package also contains steps to help expand exports of farm products to take advantage ofstill the key issue here is thatjapan again finds the need to stimulate its economy this should be considered several earlier posts focusing on how trends in japan such as the boj buying stocks how japan s tight ties with china and japan s reliance on exporting to america help explain how japan has held its economy together instead the government of japan ran huge deficits and ran up massive debt while they claim otherwise in many waysthe japanification of the world s economy however may play out far worse for the global financial system than it did for japan not all economists see more deficit spending as the answer to japan s problems and argue that more spending will only hurt efforts such as the recent consumption tax hike to improve japan s overall fiscal health japan holds the title of having the industrial world s heaviest public debt burden its debt is more than twice the size of its 5 trillion economy the world s negative yielding debt hit a record 17 trillion at the start of september mostly as a result of most japanese debt trading in negative territory as the bank of japan continues to monetize the country s debt since that time the amount of negative yielding debt has fallen this folds back into what might be viewed as the boj s stealth tapering kuroda is now monetizing just a tiny fraction of the bonds the boj was mandated with buying because it has almost run out of monetizable debt what we see occurring in japan stems from a far greater problem than simply slow growth at some point reality will set in and the yen will suffer as a result of these policies while this has been expected for some time it most likely will not be the catalyst for global financial collapse since the yen constitutes around only 4 of the world s reserve currency however it would gravely wound fiat currencies and alter how they are viewed
historians have often cast the story of cigarettes in 20th century america in epochal terms smoking as that narrative goes insidiously afflicted public health and life expectancy decade after decade through the 1960s after which it was gradually banished by the light of science the stories within this narrative are familiar elite conspiracies against the public the struggle for truth in science and policy popular consumer products secretly delivering dependence and death we know those stories well but in her new book the cigarette a political history sarah milov tells a different story or more accurately several different ones she delivers not a singular epic but descriptions of historical episodes that function like well observed interconnected short stories each untangling a unique aspect of the tobacco industry s embeddedness in the united states s political economy by the end the clear outlines of the old epic s heroes and villains are considerably hazier as with any good short story writer milov s strength is her rhetorical restraint the cigarette is the macguffin that unifies these tales but it remains uninterpreted in itself the most she says in this respect is tobacco forces us to strip away sentimentalities about the twentieth century describing the politics of the cigarette in successive eras she engages deeply in analyses of political economy and yet the economy of her prose is not unlike that of flannery o connor who wrote of the short story a story is a way to say something that can t be said any other way and it takes every word in the story to say what the meaning is milov s first story draws on the milieu of another southern writer robert penn warren whose first novel night rider describes the wild and violent world of early 20th century tobacco production milov explains how that world was eventually tamed for many decades discord reigned in the growing regions of the south as farmers tried to resist the power of the american tobacco company a monopoly as powerful in its sphere as standard oil or us steel were in theirs the trust was eventually busted creating the ancestors of the tobacco companies we know today but as milov explains tobacco farmers understood that only a pantomime of competition existed among the companies buyers dominated the market through an auction house system prices varied wildly by the minute farmers had almost no bargaining power and profits were made in backroom deals in response the farmers organized creating associations to withhold tobacco from the companies until producers received a fair price growers who didn t get in line faced the wrath of their neighbors though lawsuits were more common than night riders actually burning fields in the first decades of the century writes milov these networks of growers became more sophisticated and genteel allying themselves with farm bureaus university agricultural extensions and crusading publications like progressive farmer in what she calls well worn networks of agricultural associationalism these networks initially prospered before ultimately being rejected as ineffective in the 1930s by the farmers themselves the relationships they created were nonetheless key to establishing the tobacco regime of the new deal era a quota system that remarkably lasted until 2004 essentially the right to grow tobacco became a new form of virtual property that was generated based on the acreage farmed in the 1930s milov shows how the establishment of these quotas was outsourced to local elites who exhibited the racism and favoritism one might expect the result was not a representative farmer democracy it was a fusion of administrative oligarchy and economic populism like other recent scholarship on racial and economic inequality these chapters of the cigarette do not so much emphasize the exclusion of the powerless as highlight the synthetic creation of the white middle class in the united states the quotas were a bureaucratic artifact and yet over time they came to be viewed as the patrimony of a mythical construct the american farmer citizen whose image the tobacco industry and its allies consciously and assiduously massaged through the emerging art of public relations farmers were instructed to think of themselves as citizens family patriarchs church members and community stewards and not as recipients of government aid writes milov the farm bureau encouraged members to consider the superiority of rural virtues but this said farm bureau members were not alone in assimilating government largesse into a sense of earned property indeed at the very same time suburban americans likewise began to understand single family homes purchased with federally subsidized mortgages as the birthright of the middle class these same organizations militated in favor of jim crow and against welfare programs that would have benefited african americans while at the same time supporting price controls that effectively sustained a welfare state for rural white people eventually rather than themselves doing the hard work of farming a majority of quota owners made their money by renting their rights to others if the influence of tobacco discolors the new deal it similarly stains 20th century foreign policy initiatives that might otherwise appear admirable the state had already given its blessing to the tobacco industry when it included cigarettes in the standard c ration during world war ii in the chapter cultivating the grower milov shows how savvy lobbyists were able to use postwar foreign policy to create overseas markets for surplus american leaf employing the same kind of associational influence they had used to help shape the new deal lobbyists secured federal purchases of tobacco for distribution abroad as part of the marshall plan and the agricultural trade development and assistance act later known as food for peace economic and political elites essentially used tobacco as a tool in the global struggle for democracy and against communism one virginia congressman said of war weary europeans tobacco is something they want and it will instill a desire to strive for the better things in life which can be obtained under freedom of initiative provided by democratic governments meanwhile economists lauded the fact that tobacco could generate tax revenue and almost as importantly encourage trade in dollars in short this american mercantilist moment is profoundly implicated in the global public health impact of tobacco throughout her book milov seeks to remind us of when tobacco was a normal part of american political economy if you want to know what the smoke filled rooms of midcentury america were really like this is the book to read as well she reminds us too that the establishment a term once ubiquitous and just as ambiguous included tobacco s advocates in government the cigarette changes tone and focus following the 1964 surgeon general s report a key document establishing the link between smoking and cancer she smartly opens the book in medias res with the scene of the press conference for the report which came out on a saturday so as not to disrupt the stock market many readers will find milov s treatment of the anti smoking movement most relevant for understanding political struggles today having introduced us to an america where cigarettes were a normal part of everyday life milov then dramatizes just how unusual were the efforts to combat tobacco as she explains the identity of the nonsmoker needed to be invented after all it seemed deeply counterintuitive at the time to assert opinions about what fellow citizens consumed today the hazards of secondhand smoke are obvious but not so in the 1950s milov shows how the political and cultural movement to protect nonsmokers in fact outpaced the science to advance their cause anti smoking activists borrowed tactics from consumer advocates like ralph nader as well as from the countercultural movement with names like ash action on smoking and health and gasp group against smoking pollution the founders of these groups seem pluckily heroic and even flagrantly eccentric in their zealous pursuit of public interest lawsuits and consciousness raising sloganeering thank you for not smoking milov reminds us that even removing the ashtrays from one s home in the 60s and 70s was considered bold but the stories of the cigarette are not told in heroic mode though she has an eye for charming details milov analyzes the tactics of grassroots groups with the practical spirit of a saul alinsky explaining how they decided for instance to target airplanes as sites for nonsmoking campaigns she shows how the character of anti smoking campaigns won over white collar women but alienated blue collar men along with their unions which brings the cigarette to the scene of its demise the workplace as milov tells it the tale of smoking bans in the workplace began as a dogged fight for citizens rights only to end in bureaucratic policies motivated by corporate costs this story starts in 1975 with the remarkable ordeal of donna shimp an at t employee with an extreme sensitivity to cigarette smoke when the office near her home closed shimp was transferred to a building laden with smoke her efforts to increase air circulation in the office were shut down by other employees finally she resorted to wearing a gas mask a company doctor insisted shimp be put on paid sick leave but her leave ended up lasting months instead of days eventually she was relocated to an even more distant office with fewer smokers but her respiratory issues persisted furthermore she suspected that management and the employees union were conspiring to get her fired with the help of ash shimp sued in the case of shimp v new jersey bell telephone co she won the right to work in a building where employees could only smoke on their lunch breaks examining the company s legal strategy milov suspects that bell telephone actually wanted the court to force its hand after all the ruling only applied to one employee regardless individual struggles like shimp s set in motion events that would lead to an entirely different tactic for creating smoke free workplaces during her absence from work shimp began marshaling evidence that smoking was detrimental to companies profits not just to their employees health she discovered taylorist productivity studies that convincingly showed that smokers were less efficient workers further the trial revealed that bell telephone already understood the extent of harm that smoke could cause its equipment and thus its bottom line over time these facts proved much more persuasive than legal arguments after the ruling shimp even found a new career helping other employers create smoke free workplaces where shimp failed as precedent donna shimp was determined to succeed by persuasion milov writes she was she realized a perfect consultant a source of knowledge strategy and inspiration for other americans suffering through smoke at work moved by the logic of scientific management 38 percent of companies had completely banned smoking by 1990 and 68 percent had some sort of official policy regulating it ten years before only 15 percent of companies had had any such policy milov makes it easy to see the downsides of how our present smoke free world came about by the 1990s hat has once been a novel expansion of workplace liability was now inside the circuitry of corporate risk analysis changes in smoking policies accompanied the decline of unions who were reluctant to give up workers treasured smoke breaks just as they were reluctant to condone policies rewritten outside the collective bargaining process companies today enjoy wide latitude to fire workers who smoke or even to refuse employment to job candidates with smoking spouses inevitably the burdens of this new regime fall on poorer americans who are more likely to smoke and less likely successfully to quit as is too often the case in this country the needs of those who don t contribute to the bottom line are ignored readers may or may not agree with milov s conclusion that the movement for nonsmokers rights while laudable unwittingly catalyzed a conservative political strategy whose far reaching effects are scarcely fathomable and all too real but her politically infused tales are likely to teach any reader something new about countless aspects of american government including for instance the role of big tobacco in creating the american legislative exchange council or the surprising anti smoking crusade of ronald reagan s surgeon general as a work of nonfiction the cigarette should be considered alongside other clear sighted takes on how politics in the united states is actually done including such works as marc reisner s cadillac desert or michael grunwald s the new new deal ultimately it was milov s style that really captured me her ability to deliver single sentences of incisive analysis fulfills flannery o connor s mandate for the short story applied masterfully to describe political moments for instance in describing american trade representatives assessing the french market for american tobacco she writes that they realized that taste was political not natural and it was always the result of negotiation at the macro level her work serves to recapture a sense of possibility in historical junctures that have already closed thus implicitly opening a wider range of future possibilities in her essay the fiction writer and his country o connor reacted to critics who called for more affirmative stories of america unless we are willing to accept our artists as they are the answer to the question who speaks for america today will have to be the advertising agencies she wrote where the artist is still trusted he will not be looked to for assurance those who believe that art proceeds from a healthy and not from a diseased faculty of the mind will take what he shows them as a revelation not of what we ought to be but of what we are at a given time and under given circumstances that is as a limited revelation but revelation nevertheless the united states s most pressing health crises today require exactly such circumstantial revelations about similar objects steeped in layers of significance the handgun the prescription pad the car and yes the corporation such reflections are long overdue for the past several decades discourse around american health has devolved into a narrow debate over the mechanics of the american health care system and more often into an even more blinkered fight over access to insurance yet most public health experts will agree that the greatest gains in american life expectancy in the 20th century were achieved through the demise of smoking today our greatest health challenges arise from inequality and racism which are squarely beyond the ambit of the formal health care system to undo these injustices milov shows us we will need to dig for stories with greater stakes than who gets to see the doctor and when

here s our summary of key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news of more strong gains in the relative value of the new zealand currency as our trade gains with china multiply china s exports in november shrank for the fourth consecutive month when valued in us dollars but actually rose when valued in yuan a turnaround they will be satisfied with but growth in imports was more stronger in both usd and yuan terms and may be a sign that beijing s stimulus steps are starting to work and china foreign currency reserves were essentially unchanged in november holding at about us 3 1 tln and a level they have been at for all of 2019 the trade war is showing no signs of eating into these reserves and iron ore prices are starting to rise again even if imports are down sharply prices are up more than 12 in the past month meanwhile china s imports of copper and oil are at or approaching record levels the same chinese data showed that new zealand exported about twice as much to china in november than we imported from them the politically sensitive trade with the us shows their exports to the us fell 8 4 while their imports from the us fell almost 20 leaving their large surplus with the us little changed in hong kong there was a massive street rally in support of democracy it is clear the beijing imposed administration does not have the support of the people of hong kong this protest was peaceful in the us consumer credit rose 4 8 in october and more than expected to a record us 4 165 tln or 19 3 of gdp that is up from 19 2 a year ago the october rise was the biggest increase in three months and was driven by a jump in use of credit cards the rises for car loans and student loans were more modest american consumer sentiment also rose underpinned by good employment numbers the us non farm payrolls survey data for november came firmer than expected 266 000 new jobs were added and there were minor positive adjustments to both prior month s data the end of the gm strike seems to have had a cascading impact however their low participation rate was unchanged at 63 2 so while the rise will be welcomed it isn t a sign more people are being drawn back into their labour market after adjusting for the gm strike manufacturing employment was flat it was down for mining read the oil patch unchanged in retail and up strongly in healthcare professional job numbers also rose us hourly earnings are up 3 1 over the past twelve months all this data supports the us fed in its stance that their monetary policy settings are about right and markets now don t expect any change when they next meet to review those settings on thursday nzt meanwhile trucking companies ordered 39 fewer big rig trucks in november compared with the same month a year ago and that was also 21 lower than for october a weak start for what is typically the busiest season for new equipment orders this comes as us freight volumes fell 5 9 in october compared with the same month a year ago while freight rates were down 2 5 on the same basis you can see what is driving these declines in the latest wholesale trade data which is 1 4 lower in october than a year ago and the bank of international settlements has said page 12 that a combination of a reluctance of four big american banks to lend their cash reserves when some large hedge funds needed secured funding explains the gyrations in the new york repo market that caused the federal reserve to have to step up with emergency liquidity in canada the situation is definitely not as positive for payrolls they recorded a drop in payrolls of 79 000 jobs in november and a rise in their jobless rate to 5 9 but over the past year jobs in canada have grown by an impressive 293 000 and most of that is for full time employment their participation rate is much better that their neighbours however at 65 6 and that clouds comparisons especially of the jobless rate in australia there is more evidence of a steep contraction in their construction industry and it is now at its lowest level since 2013 the contraction dived a worrying 3 9 points in november from october alone that is a big move the ust 10yr yield is at 1 84 and a similar level to this time last week their 2 10 curve is much more positive at 22 bps their 1 5 curve is more positive for the week at 11 bps their 3m 10yr curve is also more positive 32 bps the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 15 and an 11 bps gain for the week the china govt 10yr is now at 3 23 and up 3 bps for the week the nz govt 10 yr is now at 1 49 up a remarkable 19 bps for the week gold is now at us 1 460 oz and down us 4 for the week us oil prices are up further to just under us 59 50 bbl and that is a rise in a week of us 4 the brent benchmark is now just under us 64 50 bbl pushing them to this 3 month high has been an opec move to curtail supplies further the kiwi dollar is on a tear now up at 65 7 usc and 1½c higher than this time last week and at its highest since the end of july four months ago in the past month it is up a remarkable 3 7 on the cross rates we are firmer too up at 96 auc and another 1c gain in a week in fact since the start of november we have gained more than 3c against the aussie dollar against the euro we are up at 59 4 euro cents and that is also more than a 1c gain in a week that puts the twi 5 at just on 70 8 bitcoin is little changed

cambridge with interest rates on government debt at multi decade lows a number of leading economists have argued that almost every advanced economy can allow debt to drift up toward japanese levels over 150 per cent of gdp even by the most conservative measure without any great concern about long term consequences advocates of much higher debt might be right but they tend to downplay or ignore everything that can go wrong first and foremost the new view of debt understates the risks to other claimants on public tax revenues such as pensioners who might be thought of as junior debt holders in the twenty first century welfare state after all most social security systems are debt like in the sense that the government takes money from you now and promises to pay it back with interest when you are old and for governments this junior debt is massive relative to the senior market debt that sits atop it indeed governments in oecd countries are currently paying out an average of 8 per cent of gdp in old age pensions and a staggering 16 per cent in the case of italy and greece actuarially future taxes earmarked for paying pensions swamp future taxes earmarked for paying debt by a significant multiple although many governments have been trying to adjust pensions downward gradually as europe did during the financial crisis and mexico and brazil have done under duress more recently unfortunately slow growth and aging populations mean much remains to be done thus even if it seems that governments can take on much more debt without having to pay significantly higher market interest the real risks and costs may be hidden economists alan auerbach and laurence kotlikoff made a similar point in an influential series of papers back in the 1990s second and perhaps even more critically the current complacency regarding much higher debt implicitly assumes that the next crisis will look just like the last one in 2008 when interest rates on government debt collapsed but history suggests that this is a dangerous assumption for example the next wave of crises could easily stem from a sudden realisation that climate change is accelerating much faster than previously thought requiring governments simultaneously to stall the capitalist engine and spend vast sums on preventive measures and remediation not to mention dealing with climate refugees and the next global conflagration could be a cyber war with unknown ramifications for growth and interest rates moreover aggressive experimentation with much higher debt might cause a corresponding shift in market sentiment an example of the nobel laureate economist robert lucas critique that big shifts in policy can backfire owing to big shifts in expectations and frankly any realistic assessment of current global economic risks must acknowledge that the world s most important economy is in state of political paralysis with impulsive decision making leaving it ill equipped to deal with an outside the box crisis should one arise the bottom line is that there is no guarantee that interest rates will fall in the next global crisis none of the preceding arguments undermine the strong case for investing now in high return infrastructure projects including in education that more than pay for themselves in the long run as long as governments adhere to sound debt management criteria balancing risk and cost when choosing maturities today s ultra low interest rates offer great opportunities but the broader claim that issuing government debt has become a veritable free lunch similar to government profits from currency issuance has been dangerously overblown if the aim of government policy is to reduce inequality the only sustainable long term solution involves raising taxes on high earners debt is not a magic shortcut for giving to the poor without taking from the rich true in many advanced economies current real inflation adjusted interest rates on government debt are below the real rate of economic growth presumably therefore governments can take on much more debt without ever having to raise taxes after all as long as income is growing faster than the stock of public debt simple arithmetic shows that the ratio of debt to gdp income will fall over time yet things are not quite so simple interest rates are ultra low in part because global investors are starved of safe assets that will still pay out in the event of a sharp downturn or economic catastrophe but can governments in fact provide that insurance for free if there is a risk that interest rates will rise in the next major systemic crisis a recent international monetary fund study of 55 countries over the last 200 years showed that although economic growth exceeded interest rates on government debt almost half the time this was not a good predictor of whether the surveyed countries were safe from interest rate spikes in a crisis last but not least how sure can investors be that they will come first in line in the next crisis as they did in 2008 will the united states government again put wall street before main street and honour debts to china ahead of obligations to pensioners modern economies have many important uses for debt but it is never a risk free option for governments which is why it should be taken on and managed wisely even when rock bottom borrowing costs prevail kenneth rogoff

the outsized role of unfettered finance in chile has only worsened inequality that led to recent uprisings in september this year less than a month before frustrated chileans took to the streets in santiago on chile day former finance minister felipe larrain announced new legislation that it was hoped would make chile into a regional financial center the new bill would contains regulatory changes to facilitate registration of foreign securities in chile and eliminate tax differences between locals and foreigners that affected the ability of finance to move seamlessly in the domestic economy these measures were announced to commemorate chileday in london where conor burns minister in the uk government praised chile s macro economic growth and fiscal management under the sebastian pinera government after years of trying to make the country into a financial regional center the new bill concretized the government s intentions larrain explained that the initiative meant to relax existing rules of financial regulations through a number of areas including reduce paperwork for foreign investors introduce new international practices in the local fixed income market for investors to access liquidity simplify tax laws and contracts for short term finance and make mutual funds more flexible in this way the government sought to enable growth in profits of financial assets which are primarily held by wealthy investors and high net worth chileans protestors move into the affluent providencia neighbourhood to up the ante a few days ago known as chile s financial district ironically represent the apogee of this relationship after unease spread about the social conditions in chile after the increase on metro fares minister felipe larrain who retained the position from pinera s 2010 administration was sacked larrain s firing is emblematic for several reasons much of the recent analysis while rightly focusing on worsening social conditions for the majority of chileans few commentators have pinpointed one if not the most important culprit of high inequality since chile became a democracy ended in 1990 chile s embrace of financial globalization has been at the forefront of higher levels of inequality in chile for over the last 2 decades during both left and right wing governments the planned growth of the financial sector while good for investors and those with idle assets it is not positive for the majority of chileans the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean shows ownership of financial assets are concentrated in the pocket books of the 1 per cent in 2017 the net worth of households was extremely distorted while the poorest 50 of households had an average net worth of us 5 000 the sum for the wealthiest 10 averaged us 760 000 and the richest 1 owned us 3 million to make matters worse the richest 10 made a whopping 92 2 of investments in shares and mutual funds other forms of equity holdings and investment portfolios and 77 4 of deposits in savings accounts and long term fixed deposits in comparison the lower 50 per cent of the population held just 7 7 of total physical assets like motor vehicles and real estate as a result many chileans are swimming in debt owing a total of us 116 billion about 44 percent of gross domestic product a significant portion due to mortgages and showing increases by 12 per cent since 2010 in its 2018 economic survey the oecd laid out the conditions that have led to the current crisis as many 30 per cent of chilean workers engage in informal work or on short term contracts with high concentrations among women youth low skilled and indigenous groups while unemployment benefits are virtually nonexistent self employed workers earn 20 less than a formal waged employee with the same skills and experience financial sector employees also make more than twice the average worker and even mining sector workers over the years this wage inequality and labour informalisation have been facilitated by deregulating labour markets whereby workers have less bargaining power of labour unions labour unions calls to increase their stake in the congress therefore offer some hope for workers to gain more of the share of national wealth increases in labour income as eclac shows have a positive effect on macro economic growth pinera s obstinacy to these initiatives seem to protect his economic standing rather than promote a resolution in workers favour government resistance would only encourage further polarization chile s financial sector has expanded at a rate more than any other economic sector and realized a significant portion of total income and profits in the country in terms of asset base as a percentage of gdp the financial sector including money bank deposits and of other financial institutions it has growth from 64 in 1984 to 67 in the late 1990s surpassing the 100 mark in 2010 in 2016 this ratio reached 117 after mexico chile has the highest capital penetration of foreign banks in latin america which has counter intuitively reduced the amount of credit available to small local businesses to finance production in new products and sectors in the meanwhile foreign investment has however expanded in areas that do not employ great numbers large mining businesses which employ fewer numbers of chileans also have a disproportionate access to international markets for credit chile s pension system is also privatized and seen as source for financial sharks to make a killing which fluctuates according to traders optimism and can lose as it did in late 2018 when investors lose confidence increased privatization of the state and narrow industrial policies promoted by agencies like the inter american development bank bolster the role of finance using a number of instruments and incentives compared to years prior to the dictatorship and for a short period during pinochet reign after the banking crisis of the 1980s finance was largely well regulated and credit expanded to sectors that generated a large number of jobs now rather than expanding employment and increasing high value industrial exports chile has since the 2000s suffered becoming more and more specialized in mining even as private investment flows increased in copper mining during the 2000s this has not had a broad effect on re industrializing the chilean economy the opposite is true in fact the majority of the country s lithium is manufactured outside of the country while some economists have suggested that that higher inequality was due to the end of the high price commodity boom in chile in 2014 the historical record shows that inequality was rampant during pinochet s dictatorship and only slightly decreased from the 1990s onwards inequality was practically baked into the tax system as well as the housing and transport policies of successive governments as chileans found it hard to seek work opportunities in its capital city santiago this has earned chile the infamy of the most unequal country in latin america and the oecd as a whole according to certain analyses as the world awakens to the reality that the expanding finance do not lift all boats or trickle down if there is to be a successful resolution to the current calamity that dates back to the reforms of pinochet democratizing finance is critical to return power to the hands of chileans

your weekly shop could get pricier if boris johnson is returned to power writes louise mcbride the outcome of the uk general election this thursday will have repercussions for brexit and in turn for irish people brexit will take a toll on the day to day finances of irish people in coming years so how exactly might the uk general election impact your finances your weekly shop the weekly shop could become more expensive for irish consumers if british prime minister boris johnson and his conservative party win a majority in the general election if boris johnson wins and the conservatives get the brexit deal through sterling is likely to become stronger said independent economist alan mcquaid that would be good for irish exporters as their goods will become more competitive in the uk however a stronger sterling would make it more expensive to import goods to ireland from the uk and this higher expense is likely to get passed on to irish consumers ireland imports many goods from the uk including detergents kitchen items cereals confectionery baked goods yoghurts and beverages such as tea and coffee a stronger sterling could therefore push up the cost of such items by contrast a win for the uk labour party and leader jeremy corbyn would probably weaken sterling according to mcquaid corbyn has been accused of pursuing policies which could harm business although corbyn has insisted he is not anti business his tax plans which include a plan to raise corporation tax and to hike income tax for high earners in the uk has sparked alarm among the business community in the uk if corbyn is elected and is anti business sterling might weaken said mcquaid that would be bad for irish exporters but good for irish consumers as the weak sterling would make it cheaper to go on holidays to the uk and to buy goods imported here from the uk some believe a conservative majority could eliminate much of the uncertainty around brexit which should be good for the irish economy you could argue that if the conservatives get into power they could bring a degree of certainty to the brexit issue in the short term and that would have a positive effect for irish consumers and investors as it would likely boost consumer confidence and consumer spending said kieran mcquinn research professor in the economic and social research institute esri on the other hand some of corbyn s policies are left of centre and this could lead to uncertainty bear in mind though there are some who believe corbyn would deliver a softer brexit than johnson would and that a softer brexit would be better for the irish economy among other parties campaigning in the uk general election are the liberal democrats the scottish national party green party and brexit party none of these are likely to form a majority government though even if the conservatives get a majority and uncertainty around brexit eases in the coming months the threat of a hard brexit could return the conservatives want a free trade agreement fta between the uk and eu signed by december 31 2020 many experts believe there is not enough time the notion that the uk can negotiate a new fta in a year is not credible said mcquinn as a result you could have the spectre of the uk crashing out of the eu this time next year uncertainty around brexit could well return next year therefore with investors and consumers feeling the impact irish expats irish expats who moved to the uk for work and who bought property there could find it easier to return to ireland if sterling rallies after the uk general election with strong sterling expats would get more euros for the sterling sale price of their uk property than they would when sterling is weak so if the pound recovers it may become more financially feasible for irish expats to sell a uk property and move home if you are an irish owner of uk property the euro value of that property will rise if sterling strengthens though the sterling value of your property may have decreased in recent months due to the general flattening of the uk property market and uncertainty around brexit said gearoid keegan senior treasury dealer at investec investors the upcoming uk election could create new investment opportunities for irish investors depending on its outcome there are a lot of assets in the uk trading at a big discount and sterling is trading at a big discount too said peter brown co founder of baggot investment partners i d expect a rush of investors into uk investment trusts after the election if the conservatives get a majority a uk investment trust is a publicly listed company which invests in financial assets as with any investment be sure to understand the risks of a uk investment trust before investing in one brown expects a very strong rally in the uk currency after the election if the conservatives get a majority i d expect sterling to strengthen so 80p sterling would get you 1 said brown should the pound rally and correct itself towards the 80p euro to sterling rate this would be a big improvement on the currency s performance in recent months last august it fell to record lows of around 92p against the euro though in recent weeks sterling has got much stronger a stronger pound would boost the value of sterling assets and british property for an irish investor however it will cost more to buy such assets when sterling is stronger as their euro will be worth less against it so irish investors seeking to invest in uk property and assets need to get their timing right it is also important to choose the right type of investment to take a long term view and to understand that if the uk currency dives in the future the value of sterling based investments will also dive it could all go wrong if we don t get a majority government in the uk after the election or if we don t get a government at all said brown if we don t get a clear decision on the uk government any investment opportunities in the uk will be delayed if you get a conservative majority the investment opportunity is likely to be in early january but if the election is messy if boris johnson can t get a majority or if brexit is postponed it s more likely to be summer when the investment opportunities in the uk arise a labour victory would also delay uk investment opportunities according to brown the complication of corbyn getting in is that he will likely look for another brexit referendum and that will stall any uk investment opportunities for six months said brown a hung parliament is also likely to stall investment opportunities and weaken the pound if we were to get a hung parliament or a labour majority the value of sterling could fall and sterling could very well reach a level of 90p against the euro which would see the euro value of sterling investments fall said keegan any return to the threat of a hard brexit particularly if the uk does not pass the withdrawal agreement which outlines the terms on which the uk will leave the eu by the end of january or if the fta can t be negotiated by the end of 2020 could spell losses for investors there s a lot of uncertainty as to what a hard brexit might do to sterling and what it might do to assets exposed to the uk such as uk properties and sterling cash said dan moroney investment strategist with brewin dolphin a surprising number of irish people have such assets as there s such an uncertain outcome to brexit an irish investor with exposure to the uk should ask themselves why they have it and if the investment is worth hanging onto avoid rash investment decisions though an investor may have 25 to 30 years ahead of them said moroney to be making significant changes to an investment as a result of something that will happen over the next 12 months could be a mistake be it the uk election brexit the irish general election or the us presidential election as long as an investor has a long term horizon and is well diversified they should view elections as entertainment as opposed to a reason to make a major investment decision the irish us elections and your pocket irish election an irish general election is expected around may 2020 it will be brexit rather than the shape of the next government which will have most impact on the finances of irish people in the coming years according to independent economist alan mcquaid government policy irrespective of who is in power will be a response to how it sees things playing out on the economic front as a result of brexit said mcquaid many believe there is little difference between the policies of the main irish parties and so for that reason a change in the governing party would see irish people no worse or better off financially after a general election by and large the main parties are centrist so after a 2020 general election you re likely to see a continuation of what we ve seen in recent years where everyone gets something but not very much said mcquaid the stance taken by the government on environmental issues will however have an impact on the day to day finances of people the so called green wave where there has been an increase in the numbers seeking urgent action on climate change is one of the main reasons the government raised the carbon tax in the latest budget further hikes in carbon tax are expected in the coming years us election us president donald trump will seek re election in the poll of november 2020 given his unpredictable nature it is hard to call the impact which a re election of trump would have on investors the world economy and ireland trump is generally viewed as good for business however a number of his policies including the ongoing trade war between the us and china have rattled stock markets the present white house and trade policies have sparked a huge degree of uncertainty said kieran mcquinn of the esri the heightened tensions between the us and china have an impact on the irish economy we are an open economy any policies which cause uncertainty in global conditions will have a negative impact on the irish economy given the proximity of the presidential election some believe the chances of an escalation in the us china trade war before then are low as this could increase the risk of a recession which could in turn damage trump s chances of re election the stronger the us economy is the better it is for everyone as the us economy is the biggest economy in the world said mcquaid if the us economy is weak that could weaken the world economy which could lead to job losses in ireland any future moves by trump to penalise us multinationals with overseas bases in ireland could however damage the multinational sector here if multinationals were to withdraw from ireland that would lead to a much weaker economy here less jobs and lower disposable income said mcquaid

major central banks are set to keep pumping money into financial markets and economies next year although at a slower pace than recently the combined monthly balance sheet expansion of the federal reserve european central bank and bank of japan will end this year at the highest level since 2017 as each sucks up bonds either to boost their economies or ease strains in money markets according to bloomberg while the rate of buying will peak at the turn of the year and slow throughout 2020 the expansion still marks a reversal from the start of this year when the total balance sheet was shrinking with the fed actively paring its holdings and only the boj adding purchases debatable is how potent the buying will prove as the world economy remains threatened by the u s china trade war the bloomberg calculations show the combined balance sheet growth of the three biggest central banks will reach almost 100 billion a month by the end of this year the spike will fade somewhat in 2020 reaching about 50 billion by the middle of next year one difference from previous episodes of qe is that although the ecb and boj are actively seeking to stoke economic growth by restraining market borrowing costs the fed argues it s purchasing treasury bills at an initial monthly pace of 60 billion because of recent turmoil in money markets one force which is back in evidence is central bank liquidity matt king global head of credit product strategy at citigroup inc wrote in a recent note to clients despite the fed s protestations that its adjustment to bank reserves is not qe its turnaround this year has helped drive global central bank securities purchases from 10 year lows to decade average levels nevertheless investors are welcoming the extra liquidity that s despite fed chairman jerome powell s protests that the new u s purchases are in no sense quantitative easing because they re focused on very short term assets and aimed at alleviating a cash shortage in the money markets the msci world index of stocks is up 21 this year the bulk of the effect is psychological said stephen stanley amherst pierpont chief economist the fed is expanding the balance sheet the public sees this as an easier monetary policy even as the fed insists that it is not a change in policy and thus asset prices rise whether the bigger balance sheets will actually power economic demand is still in doubt though global growth remains modest despite a decade of ultra loose monetary policy there is plenty of liquidity sloshing around but firms are reluctant to invest said chua hak bin at maybank kim eng research pte in singapore pointing to the u s china trade war as a source of uncertainty ben emons managing director for global macro strategy at medley global advisors in new york is more optimistic he argues that the renewed burst of qe will be more effective than previous cycles given the world economy isn t in crisis and so the liquidity is more likely to spur spending at the fed the balance sheet is growing faster than when it was first on its way to 4 trillion six years ago the institution had been gradually shrinking its massive securities holdings but the process drained too much cash out of the system contributing to a spike in market rates in september it reversed course to restore ample liquidity and officials have uniformly argued it s not aimed at affecting asset prices economists at societe generale sa say it ll be less clear cut whether the new round of buying amounts to qe when the fed replaces temporary funds with permanent purchases which could total 200 billion the strategy of swapping maturing agency mortgage backed securities with u s treasuries may also have qe style effects they said in a report to clients this month meantime the boj s balance sheet which has expanded rapidly since governor haruhiko kuroda launched massive monetary easing in 2013 has grown 4 2 over the past year to 577 trillion yen 5 3 trillion as of nov 20 well beyond the economy s size the pledge to pump cash into the economy until inflation stays above 2 in a stable manner means there s no prospect of it shrinking any time soon inflation stripped of food and energy prices grew just 0 4 last month over at the ecb president christine lagarde is taking on a balance sheet that has soared to almost 4 7 trillion euros 5 2 trillion or four times the size it was prior to the global financial crisis much of the increase has come from quantitative easing which spent 2 6 trillion euros from 2015 until the end of last year and which has just resumed at 20 billion euros a month to combat renewed economic weakness others may even join in reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe this week delivered a speech which highlighted a reluctance for quantitative easing yet laid out the conditions required for the unorthodox measures as well as what the rba would buy source bloomberg
by joe foster portfolio manager and strategist for vaneck global trade deal or no trade deal there was not much news of significance to drive markets in november as such markets became fixated on whether or not a trade deal might happen between the u s and china gold fell to its low for the month of 1 445 per ounce on november 12 amid press reports of a phase 1 tariff deal that has yet to materialize however there was little movement in the dollar or interest rates and the stock market turned giddy once again with the s p 5001 zooming to new all time highs perhaps the stock market is also responding to the resumption of quantitative easing style stimulus disguised as support for the overnight lending market for which the u s federal reserve the fed has started purchasing 60 billion of u s treasuries per month during november the gold price declined 48 99 3 2 to 1 463 95 gold stocks performed in line with gold as the nyse arca gold miners index2 fell 3 46 and the mvis global junior gold miners index3 declined 2 79 correction continues but warning signs are flashing the gold price remains elevated above 1 450 as it enters its fourth month of correction after reaching a six year high of 1 557 on september 4 in early november global gold bullion exchange traded products etps experienced their first significant outflows since early september though small inflows did resume later in the month it is difficult to see much market movement in the near term as the fed s rate outlook appears to be on hold brexit was postponed again and there has not been much change on global trade geopolitical risks continue to escalate with persistent protests in hong kong and latin america brazen terrorist attacks have gripped west africa while conflicts continue in the middle east political unrest has yet to have a significant impact on global financial markets despite its increasing breadth and frequency we believe late cycle financial risks will increase and with no end in sight to the spread of geopolitical turmoil we believe gold might see significant gains in the coming year growth strategy from exploration to m a the mining journal reported s p global markets estimates for 2019 exploration spending australia is now the top country in the world for exploration followed by canada and the u s gold remains the leading metal with 4 29 billion allocated towards exploration down 12 from last year despite the jump in the gold price as well this is actually the first year that mine site or brownfields budgets have accounted for the largest share of exploration spending with past spending results typically dominated by new or greenfields exploration we believe that this reflects the current strategy of many producers to focus on getting more from their existing assets to create value organically rather than building in new areas while this strategy is working quite well we believe that it has its limits and that eventually companies will need to increase their greenfields efforts or engage in mergers and acquisitions m a m a activity has increased recently and particularly for companies in the vaneck international investors gold fund the fund on december 2 zijin mining not held in the fund agreed to acquire continental gold 3 9 of fund net assets in a 1 05 billion all cash deal valued at a 29 premium over continental s 20 day volume weighted average stock price continental is our largest junior position in the fund the company is building colombia s first world class underground gold operation set to start production in 2020 continental has done a phenomenal job of discovering and developing the buritica project while zijin is paying a hefty premium our valuation indicates that if the company can navigate the recent political turmoil gripping colombia and properly manage the start up risks that all new mines face they too will realize a generous return on their investment a closer look at the kirkland detour deal on november 25 a friendly acquisition was announced between mid tier producers kirkland lake gold and detour gold 8 2 and 1 2 of fund net assets respectively the two combined have a market value of roughly 12 billion kirkland company presentations estimate 2019 production of 960 000 ounces mainly from two high grade underground mines in canada and australia at all in sustaining cost aisc of 540 per ounce detour estimates 2019 production of 600 000 ounces from a large low grade open pit in canada at aisc of 1 140 per ounce we hold both stocks in our fund and kirkland is our top holding both companies have been stars kirkland has been our top performing gold producer for the last two years this year the stock is up 60 and still one of our top performers in our view the company has extraordinary gold deposits and sound management detour is in the process of a turnaround under its new ceo and its stock has embarked on a re rating it is our best performing producer in 2019 to date with a gain of 119 source bloomberg the acquisition provides a third cornerstone asset for kirkland kirkland also has the capital needed to advance exploration and hopefully increase detour s production by up to 50 while the strategy behind this acquisition makes sense we are extremely disappointed with the structure of the deal this is an all stock deal where kirkland has offered a 24 premium for detour as we detailed in our october report premium all stock deals usually result in substantial declines in the acquirers share price in addition large quantities of the stock winds up in the hands of m a arbitrageurs and can churn in the market for months keeping further pressure on the stock unfortunately this deal has followed the same share price pattern we have seen in past all stock deals in the two days following the announcement kirkland declined 17 8 nearly wiping out detour s premium the decline cost 2 billion of market value for kirkland shareholders shareholders will vote on this deal in january it will be interesting to see if they accept the recent loss of value in exchange for the promise of a stronger future or whether they reject a deal structure that has destroyed value for other companies in the past in our opinion gold companies that are not willing or able to pay cash must find more innovative ways of doing m a deals that preserve and enhance value

as hunger continues to ravage through rural matabeleland and other parts of zimbabwe villagers who have had to contend with twin the sevils of food politicisation and its questionable distribution have another headache by nqobani ndlovu as hunger continues to ravage through rural matabeleland and other parts of zimbabwe villagers who have had to contend with twin the sevils of food politicisation and its questionable distribution have another headache they are failing to access the grain distributed under the social welfare programme after failing to raise money required to transport it from the grain marketing board gmb depots to their respective wards fuel prices have been going up as the sector tries to keep pace with the united states dollar to zimbabwe currency exchange rate however the rationalisation of the pricing structures in the fuel sector has done little or nothing to solve the shortages of the commodity the high fuel costs are adding another stress to the food insecure households such as child headed families and the aged who have no money to pay for transportation of the grain to their respective areas for the disabled and the vulnerable such as grannies that are taking care of their grandchildren child headed families and the terminally ill with no source of income to fend for themselves and to raise the grain transport money the situation is terrible said ndodana moyo a villager in the matobo district of matabeleland south unemployment levels are regarded as high in the southern region of the country with three provinces namely matabeleland south north and bulawayo most of the families in this part of the country rely on foreign currency they receive from relatives in neighbouring countries such as botswana and south africa the situation is critical for those with no such remittances from relatives abroad as they have to make do with hand to mouth operations to survive and not everyone is benefiting from the government food for work programme under the district development fund ddf where beneficiaries receive 160 and a 50kg of maize a month under the programme communities work with government on several community developmental projects such as maintenance of roads construction of bridges and classroom blocks in matabeleland south the programme that targets able bodied people between the ages of 18 and 60 started in september after president emmerson mnangagwa declared the drought situation in that province a state of disaster those above 60 years and the vulnerable such as people living with disabilities orphaned children and the chronically ill are supposed to get maize for free but sunday southern eye established that transport monies are still required from them vumani ndlovu who is the coordinator of the rural communities empowerment trust rucet a lupane based independent non governmental organisation said communities are facing serious food shortages in the rural matabeleland north one 50kg bag a month allocated to the elderly over 65 years through social welfare department is not enough to take care of an average of eight people in a family ndlovu said they have to also contend with transport costs to deliver the maize grain from the gmb deport which they do not have for example from lupane centre to their respective wards and villages consequences of this are dire as transport costs tend to be high due to the high cost of fuel ndlovu said the majority of villagers also cannot afford maize sold by the gmb which retails at 205 per 50 kg to supplement that one bag that they would have got under the social welfare programme in matobo north it is understood that villagers are required to part with as much as 50 per household for fuel for the transportation of grain to their villages from the gmb depots the grain is delivered at the ward centre and then the same grain has to be transported to their homes after distribution at an extra cost and this is costly to the already poor villagers the government should step in and provide transport to mitigate the long suffering said artwell sibanda a fortnight ago hilal elver the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food who was in the country on a working visit beginning november 18 to 28 warned of a man made humanitarian disaster in zimbabwe the majority of the children i met were stunted and underweight elver said in her preliminary report child deaths from severe malnutrition have been rising in the past few months at least 90 of zimbabwean children aged six months to two years are not consuming the minimum acceptable diet i saw the ravaging effects of malnutrition on infants deprived of breast feeding because of their own mothers lack of access to adequate food opposition mdc secretary general abednico bhebhe and former nkayi south mp weighed in saying the government needed to act fast to prevent deaths in the region the situation demands urgent attention from parliament to come up with a supplementary budget to pay for the transportation of social welfare food aid right up to village level to avoid the spiralling crisis before it degenerates into a full blown crisis he said bhebhe also expressed concern over the politicisation of food aid in the constituency those that are deemed not loyal to the ruling zanu pf are deprived the right to social welfare food aid he said that situation has forced many into prostitution sexual exploitation and solicitation of bribes in one way or the other transportation of the aid poses another challenge to the food crisis affecting the elderly child headed families who are required to pay varying amounts of money to carry social welfare food aid to the villages the el nino induced drought has also affected the urbanites amid estimates that as much as 2 2 million people in the urban areas are also food insecure the harsh economic crisis mirrored by high inflation has made the situation a lot worse by pushing the cost of food and other basics beyond reach mdc s matabeleland north deputy chairperson jabulani hadebe and zapu southern region communications director patrick ndlovu emphasi sed on the need for government to intervene unfortunately decisions on how to undertake the social welfare programme to feed the vulnerable are taken at a central office by someone who has never been to the ground using a questionable template ndlovu said the only workable solution is the empowerment of local communities if the resources grain are left in the hands of local communities planning of

stocks have been buoyed in recent weeks by the prospect of a light at the end of the trade war tunnel with investors anticipating an imminent phase one deal with china that upward trajectory abruptly reversed on tuesday after president donald trump said there might be no resolution until after the 2020 election in some ways i like the idea of waiting until after the election for the china deal trump told reporters from the nato summit that begins today in london adding i have no deadline the benchmark dow jones index fell 400 points shortly after opening its biggest drop in two months in response to the news economists top concern is a tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese imports primarily consumer goods that is set to take effect on dec 15 a trade deal was widely expected to suspend the implementation of those tariffs now all bets are off i think it has to go into effect otherwise trump loses his credibility said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy i think investors are factoring in that it s going to go into effect he said predicting that the market could fall by up to 10 percent goldberg remained optimistic though that a broader market rout was unlikely this is not going to be in my opinion a repeat of year end 2018 he said pointing out that concerns about inflation and higher interest rates that triggered a december selloff turned out to be unfounded i still think the market has a lot of wind at its back he said listing corporate buybacks low interest rates and solid consumer spending some experts are less sanguine saying investors have been viewing the trade war through rose colored glasses markets have been far too complacent in the whole treatment of this trade war said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics i think they re also greatly underestimating the longer run effects of this trade war he said slapping a new round of tariffs on everything from coats to computers would send shock waves through the consumer economy and threaten to derail consumer spending kirkegaard said i certainly don t think markets are pricing that in i think the reaction to that will be significantly more negative than what we ve seen in markets to date nothing good will come out of it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics referring to the trump s statements on tuesday zandi said if what he means is if he allows the tariff increases he s threatening on dec 15 to go into effect then i think we get a recession next year on those grounds some economists argue that the tariffs almost certainly will be suspended or delayed the economic fallout would be too great to risk i suspect even the china hawks in the white house don t really want to impose the december tariffs they were supposed to be a threat to win concessions from china actually implementing them would just put up prices for american families said mark williams chief asia economist at capital economics in addition to pinching household budgets and reducing consumer spending power more tariffs could hurt american job growth as well zandi estimated that the trade war thus far has probably cost the labor market around 40 000 jobs each month it s obvious in manufacturing he said adding that more tariffs could accelerate job losses on monday the president blamed the federal reserve for the contraction in manufacturing writing in a pair of tweets manufacturers are being held back by the strong dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the federal reserve the fed should lower rates there is almost no inflation and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will soar but economists say trade policy not monetary policy is the hurdle facing american manufacturing which dropped for the fourth month in a row according to figures released monday from the institute for supply management global trade remains the most significant cross industry issue timothy fiore chair of the ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in a statement and unlike last year there are fewer mitigating actions the federal reserve could take if the market plummets this time i think it s very unlikely that the fed is going to somehow surprise the markets by easing more kirkegaard said the fed has pretty clearly signaled that they re on hold now that means there is no parachute if there is a significant contraction

my grandfather has plenty of wild stories about his undergraduate years at the university of california but none is wilder to me than his stories about paying tuition from when he started as an undergraduate until the day he graduated the cost of a semester at uc berkeley was a mere 27 50 even by the standards of inflation that is paltry 27 50 in 1947 dollars is 362 92 today the cost of undergraduate tuition for berkeley for the 2019 2020 academic year is 7127 per semester meaning tuition has increased 21 8 times as fast as inflation since 1947 as of late there is talk among some progressives and leftists of making public university and community college free of course public university in the united states has never been entirely free and indeed there is a difference between free and 27 50 per semester still we can look to the past to get a sense of how our relatives back then viewed the idea of public higher education quite differently a college education for my grandfather was not a consumer good a product that one buys on credit and pays for the rest of their life likewise the tuition was not seen as the literal price at 27 50 it is clear to all that the state is subsidizing the experience tremendously as many critics have argued exorbitant college tuitions teach something to students they teach us to view college as a finishing school and as a consumer good that one buys rather than an enlightening experience the more expensive school is the more likely students are to study applied fields like finance and business rather than enriching disciplines that might make them look inwards the number of undergraduate business majors went from 8 percent before world war ii to 22 percent in 2006 that was only 70 years ago an era that many consider the halcyon days of our nation contrast that perception of college with these words spoken in october by presidential candidate amy klobuchar a democratic contender who has emerged as a favorite of media elites i just don t agree with these policies i think know that they don t make sense when you take off the veneer and put them on a bumper sticker i actually don t agree because it think it s not the best policy they may be bold ideas but i think they re bad ideas and there s a better way to do this a cbs reporter then asked why student debt forgiveness and free college proposals were popular to which klobuchar replied because people like it they like to hear that they re going to get everything free right they like it that s how andrew yang started his speech at the debate about giving people a free on thousand dollars so that s a lot of what the discussion is right now this isn t necessarily about a free college or a free degree it s about how can you help people afford the education they want on the path they want and have it fit with our economy klobuchar s sentiments that free college and complete debt forgiveness are for some reason impossible have been echoed by other presidential candidates former vice president joe biden has proposed free community college and slightly more generous student loan payback rules senator kamala harris who ended her campaign this week issued a proposal that graduates could achieve 20 000 in student debt relief if they were a pell grant recipient who started a business in a disadvantaged community and kept that business running for three years democratic party wunderkind pete buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana seems to share the same sentiment about the cost of college specifically that not everyone s debt should be forgiven and that free or affordable college isn t necessarily a right as he wrote quixotically on twitter instead of providing free college tuition for the children of millionaires and billionaires i will open doors of opportunity for americans who choose not to go to college with massive investments in apprenticeships workforce training and lifelong learning programs buttigieg is very explicit in that his plan too is not universal it will not apply to the children of millionaires and billionaires actually it won t apply to families making over 100 000 specifically his plan as proposed would make public college and university tuition free but only for those families who earn less than that he also hopes to increase pell grants there is something peculiar about all these democrats plans for college and student debt they do not propose universal access to free college they do not presuppose that everyone deserves affordable or free education they attempt to define rubrics to determine exactly who deserves that kind of education and under what circumstances as the history of college tuition in the united states shows it wasn t always like this at some point in recent political history the welfare state went from a universal conceit to something piecemeal this person judged by this rubric or bureaucrat receives such and such social program but as the multifarious opinions of the moderate democratic candidates attest the judges who dole out benefits have different ideas about what deserving means this phenomenon of the piecemeal social welfare state is not confined to the world of student debt the same thing has happened around the conversation with health care only warren sanders and sort of andrew yang support medicare for all plans the

different buy ins and private actors to function ultimately it left 28 1 million uninsured at the end of obama s term it too was only partial in its application the vision of what government does in the case of all these democrats is intriguing inasmuch as their programs are to solve problems what is the point of having a welfare state if it is not universal if they are not citizens rights and if

infected the brains of these aforementioned centrist democrats to such a deep extent that they can hardly articulate an alternative moreover they have ceased to be able to see social welfare as a right it too has become a commodity and therefore one can argue as buttigieg did that we shouldn t award such commodities to the rich as they can buy them on their own such arguments belie the idea of social services as a right and strengthen the overall case to keep the neoliberal mode of political thought dominant the dems often worry about being tarred as the tax and spend party joseph m schwartz a professor of political science at temple university told salon so they often opt for means tested programs that would garner more middle class support if they were truly universal e g

strength with upbeat comments from rbnz deputy governor bascand providing support the nzd aud cross broke above 0 96 for the first time since august all eyes are on hyefu this wednesday for the details of labour s significant fiscal package the key driver of markets on friday night was the big upside surprise to payrolls the us recorded monthly payrolls growth of 266k in november well above the 180k consensus even taking account of the returning gm workers who had been on strike payrolls was still an impressive 220k while upward revisions of 41k to prior months added to the robust tone of the report payrolls has now averaged 180k in 2019 down on 2018 s 225k pace but similar to that recorded in 2017 such a pace of job growth should be sufficient to push the unemployment rate lower over time all else equal for november the unemployment rate fell to 3 5 equalling its lowest level in 50 years while average hourly earnings were slightly higher than expected on a year on year basis at 3 1 the strength in the labour market goes a long way to explaining the resilience of the us consumer in the face of the trade war indeed the university of michigan consumer survey released later on friday revealed that us consumer confidence had returned to near its cycle highs also supported by recent gains in equities separately the atlanta fed s gdpnow estimate for q4 was lifted to 2 q q annualised from 1 5 although the ny fed s nowcast has a much more downbeat 0 6 forecast equity markets rose sharply with payrolls assuaging any lingering fears of an abrupt slowdown in the us economy the s p500 closed over 1 higher to within a fraction of its recently set record high some positive comments on us china trade talks by white house economic advisor larry kudlow added to the positive market sentiment kudllow said the deal is still close it s probably even a wee bit closer than when i made that statement in november adding that we re coming down to short strokes to finalise the agreement he did however caution that trump was prepared to walk away from negotiations if he didn t get what he wanted december 15th when tariffs are scheduled to rise on chinese consumer goods imports looms in the background rates rose after payrolls although the reaction was relatively subdued the 10 year treasury yield rose 3bps to 1 84 with the market continuing to price a full 25bp rate cut for the fed into the curve by the end of next year the fomc meeting is on thursday morning with no change universally expected there will be interest in the so called dot plot which showed an unusual degree of dispersion between fed officials interest rate forecasts at the september meeting some officials forecasted hikes while others forecasted cuts however since then it appears that fed officials have coalesced around an on hold policy for the foreseeable future at least based on the fed s baseline economic forecasts payrolls helped the usd to its first rise in six trading sessions with the usd indices we monitor up by around 0 2 the usd remains in its broader uptrend for now in terms of individual currencies the cad was the worst performer down 0 6 after a large fall in jobs in november and a surprise increase in the unemployment rate the gbp consolidated its recent gains it was up 1 7 last week as the market looks ahead to this week s general election in the uk the gbp was down 0 1 to 1 3140 near a seven month high weekend polls generally showed the conservatives maintaining a large lead over labour anywhere between 6 and 15 the nzd was the best performing currency on friday up 0 3 to 0 6566 despite the broad based strength in the usd upbeat comments by rbnz deputy governor bascand on friday added to improving sentiment towards the nzd bascand described the economy as near or around that turning point adding that additional fiscal stimulus from the government would be growth supportive and that the bank capital rules were unlikely to have major economic impacts bascand s comments follow those from governor orr on thursday in which he mentioned that monetary policy was in a holding phase recent rhetoric from senior rbnz officials suggests they plan to keep the ocr on hold although they have a watchful eye on global events including us china trade the nzd was also the best performing currency last week recording a 2 2 increase the backdrop of strong nz commodity prices signs of a bottoming in nz business confidence an impending significant fiscal stimulus and an rbnz that now seems likely to be on hold for some time have all helped support the currency additionally there were signs that speculators were starting to close short nzd positions with cftc data showing a reduction in the net short position in futures from around 2 3b to 1 8b in notional equivalent terms last week the nzd aud traded above 0 96 on friday for the first time since early august nz rates continued to track higher on friday with the 2 and 10 year swap rates closing at four month highs of 1 25 and 1 66 respectively that made it an 11bp rise on the week for the 2 year and an 18bp rise for the 10 year a big underperformance versus the us and australia the highlight in the week ahead is the release of the half year economic and fiscal update hyefu on wednesday where finance minister grant robertson will reveal the details of the government s significant fiscal package focused on infrastructure last week robertson said that the government would start targeting core crown debt within a range of 15 25 of gdp immediately rather than from 2023 as he had previously indicated given robertson went out of his way to flag this as a significant package we can only assume it will be sizeable and the government bond programme will be increased the fiscal stimulus will when implemented provide a boost to growth and may exacerbate labour and broader costs in the construction sector in turning helping to boost overall inflation the market has reduced the probability of rbnz easing to what is now just 10bps or 40 much will depend on the size of the stimulus and the timeframe over which it s implemented and the market will be eagerly awaiting its release the prospect of fiscal stimulus means that near term nz data is likely to be downgraded in importance by the market including gdp next week finally oil prices hit a three month high on friday brent crude 2 after saudi arabia said it would implement voluntary production cuts of 400 000 barrels per day over and above the 500 000 bpd agreed by opec in the week ahead there is the fomc meeting on thursday morning our guess is that this is likely to be one of the least interesting fomc quarterly meetings for some time with market participants comfortable with the fed s on hold stance the uk election is thursday while christine lagarde will oversee her first ecb meeting as president although no policy changes are expected

buffalo news ny dec 8 albany in 2020 state officials will examine whether to turn to new york residents and businesses for more tax revenues with the state facing a gaping hole in its finances and if history is an already well known guide to new yorkers that s hardly a bold prediction but how that s the 6 1 billion question the new state budget is due in march and democrats who control the state capitol are already talking about potentially major tax hikes on wealthy individuals and corporations considering past red ink periods in the annals of state budget making however low and middle class taxpayers could get caught up in the revenue raising frenzy they might not be directly affected by tax hikes already given names like the ultra millionaires tax or the pied a terre tax but those with less lofty incomes could find themselves hit directly or indirectly with any range of levy increases or higher nuisance fees affecting how much it costs for them to drive a car or heat a home or make a widget rank and file lawmakers kicked off talk about potential tax hikes two weeks ago after gov andrew m cuomo released a report on the health of the state s finances midway into the 2019 fiscal year it was gloomy a 6 1 billion deficit is at hand driven mostly by rising medicaid costs assembly leader tax don t cut assembly speaker carl heastie last week was not shy about his tax raising preferences the bronx democrat raised alarms about deep medicaid cuts no one s going to want to see their health care to be cut he told reporters heastie lined out the basic choices cut services or hike taxes for us in the assembly we would always rather raise revenues than cut he said we think new york has some very generous people and i m saying that facetiously that we would always like to call on them to do more in that regard instead of cutting health care or denying health care what heastie was talking about will be a move in 2020 to again raise taxes on new york s super wealthy earlier this year cuomo and lawmakers for the fourth time since the tax was imposed in 2009 approved an extension of a personal income tax surcharge on high earners in new york it s a tax worth about 4 5 billion annually a plan advanced by heastie and other democrats to create a new three bracket tax scheme was aimed at ensuring new york s wealthiest pay their fair share as the democratic conference put it at the time the top bracket at 10 32 would have kicked in on people making over 100 million annually that idea died in march another dead item already resurfacing for 2020 talks is a pied a terre tax which would establish a property tax surcharge on homes valued at more than 5 million a revised version of that idea addressing constitutional concerns raised this year is gaining traction among some lawmakers senate democrats as a group are in a tighter squeeze than assembly democrats who dominate their 150 member chamber senate democrats control 40 of 63 seats but importantly they are in their first year of control after ousting the gop in the 2018 elections all state legislative seats go before voters again in november senate democrats looking to maintain or increase their majority will be hard pressed to enact sweeping tax hikes which would give the gop ammunition in battleground long island districts but taxing the super wealthy many lawmakers believe could work even for the most moderate of senate democrats senate majority leader andrea stewart cousins a westchester county democrat declined to comment before she meets with democratic colleagues who head to a suburban albany hotel on monday and tuesday for closed door meetings on their 2020 priorities mike murphy a stewart cousins spokesman said senate democrats want tax breaks though he did not specifically rule out a 2020 budget that might turn to tax or fee hikes on higher income people the senate majority continues to be committed to alleviating the tax burden on middle and working class new yorkers he said the cuomo administration which has the upper hand in budget crafting isn t ready to show its hand opinions are relevant when they are based on facts and we will present actual numbers and options when we do the budget as otherwise this is all just speculation said richard azzopardi a cuomo senior advisor tax the insanely wealthy an assortment of groups on the political left influential with some democratic lawmakers are finalizing a 2020 tax the wealthy package michael kink executive director of the strong economy for all which is funded by labor and groups that advocate for homeless and low income residents said new revenue raising efforts are being worked on by advocates targeting billionaires and the most destructive big corporations he did not elaborate a key state senator said it is important to ensure medicaid money is spent wisely but cuts to hospitals and nursing homes affecting patient care should be off the table democratic state sen gustavo rivera said nearly 90 of the patients who go to the main hospital in his central bronx district are on medicaid rivera can flex his muscle on the issue in 2020 he is chairman of the senate health committee which has legislative jurisdiction over the medicaid program the idea that we re going to cut on their backs is not something i m willing to participate in rivera said of low income people who rely on medicaid instead he said revenues should be raised not from lower and middle class new yorkers but from the folks who are insanely wealthy rivera said ideas that should be explored include new higher tax brackets for new yorkers with 5 million or more in annual income a straight up wealth tax on billionaires a stock transfer tax and a state carried interest fairness fee imposed on hedge fund managers venture capitalists and private equity investors none of them impact working class people he said of the ideas nor will such tax hikes he insisted over the objections of some fiscal watchdogs push wealthy people to leave new york they live in manhattan for a reason he said rather it is the middle class being pushed out of new york and it s incredibly important that any tax and fee hikes in 2020 do not hit them if you re making over 5 million a year you can afford to pay a little bit more in taxes he added trickle down tax hikes in the past decade much of the lobbying and media attention has gone to tax hikes targeting high income earners such as the 8 82 top tax bracket on people with annual incomes of 1 million and above in the years when that upper income tax surcharge was extended albany found ways to hit lesser income new yorkers they don t get the attention that often gets put on the so called millionaire s tax but there s a history of those taxes extending to a lot of different type of taxpayers said greg biryla new york state director of the national federation of independent business which represents small business interests take just this past spring for instance the budget approved april 1 continued the millionaire s tax surcharge until 2024 and it added taxes on the sales of multimillion dollar homes in new york city at the same time the budget continued a lucrative tax break program for the film and tv industry and it approved another year of a middle class income tax decrease but it also raised taxes on people who rent vehicles upstate use vaping products buy over the internet from third party sellers on sites such as ebay and make opiods it also eliminated sales tax exemptions on certain gas and electricity transmissions gap closing closely eyed cuomo in january will unveil his 2020 budget plan along with his ideas to close the 6 1 billion deficit which could worsen or improve by the april 1 fiscal year start two thirds of the operating deficit is caused by rising medicaid costs an ongoing boost in the state s minimum wage cost the state 700 million this year to cover the wages of medicaid reimbursed health workers and long term care and other factors are driving unanticipated other health costs it is a situation being eyed outside albany medicaid spending becoming achilles heel of state budget moody s investors service used as the headline on a report it issued last week about new york s finances moody s noted that a solution to new york s medicaid cost hikes is not yet in sight that the state is set to outpace the nation in medicaid growth and overall that recurring budget gaps only get worse through at least 2023 it did not touch new york s current credit ratings but it called the budget situation a credit

berlin the european central bank s ecb decision in september to pursue more monetary policy easing was controversial with one board representative from germany resigning over the move but one of the most remarkable features of the ecb s position has not gotten enough attention the admission that inflation expectations have become de anchored and that without fiscal policy support the central bank will probably fail to fulfill its price stability mandate for the foreseeable future in fact many observers and even several members of the ecb s governing council now argue that the bank needs to adapt its mandate with a new definition of price stability in mind they are right but there is one crucial caveat since central bank independence was strengthened in the 1990s it has become clear that in normal times the specific mandate does not matter much the united states federal reserve managed to guide expectations and achieve price stability with its dual mandate price stability and maximum employment just as well as the bank of england or the ecb with their narrower price stability mandates after the global financial crisis however the traditional mandate proved inadequate to cope with large scale financial instability fickle market confidence and political paralysis developed country central banks had to devise policies on the fly without a guiding framework each in its own way pursued unprecedented monetary easing massively expanding its balance sheet in order to provide much needed support to the economy in many ways these measures succeeded monetary expansion played a major role in pulling the economy back from the brink but over time central banks capacity to affect the real economy declined today and for the foreseeable future domestic inflation is increasingly affected by global rather than local developments and financial in stability and fiscal policy are far more influential than monetary policy for the ecb this generates a particularly serious challenge after all unlike other central banks it must account for the preferences of 19 sovereign national governments with little to no structural or fiscal policy coordination the eurozone is also highly fragmented financially lacking a common capital market a unifying safe asset or macroeconomic stabilisation tools the ecb needs a more realistic and flexible mandate given the eurozone s fragmented nature that mandate should probably still be centered on price stability but it should also recognise that the current definition of price stability below but close to 2 per cent inflation over the medium term is too narrow a broader definition is needed according to which the ecb pursues a symmetric inflation target of 2 per cent within a 1 5 2 5 per cent band over a longer time horizon some advocate an even higher target for example olivier blanchard a former international monetary fund chief economist has proposed re anchoring expectations at 4 per cent a different proposal from new york federal reserve president john williams is to target a price level rather than an inflation rate a commitment to more broadly defined price stability in the long term would give the ecb more space during times of crisis thereby enabling it to account better for risks to financial stability and the real economy this would help it to stabilise prices more quickly bolstering its credibility by contrast when the ecb consistently fails to meet its price stability objective as it has for the last five years it loses credibility and indeed the ecb has faced harsh criticism sometimes warranted often not over its implementation of untested expansionary monetary policies since 2008 partly because the measures were often poorly understood by the public the loss of credibility has undermined the ecb s capacity to fulfill its objectives creating a vicious circle that threatens its de facto independence this is why the timing of any mandate change must be chosen very carefully if the ecb tries to move the goalpost while it is missing the shot the short term blow to its already diminished credibility could be serious given this the ecb must work to strengthen its standing before it adjusts its mandate including by attempting to reach the existing price stability objective after years of failure at the same time the ecb must communicate better what its capabilities are some have urged the ecb to try addressing the solvency problems of banks or governments during the crisis others would like the ecb to discipline governments to do the right thing and consolidate spending a central bank must do neither and would utterly fail if it tried but these attempts have hurt the ecb s standing particularly in germany and have diminished its credibility clarifying the contents of the ecb s policy toolbox including sovereign bond purchases and other non standard measures would go a long way toward protecting the ecb from such attacks in the future and when the time comes to shift its objectives the ecb must communicate the change which to be sure may not need to be as big as many believe clearly and thoroughly us president john f kennedy was right the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining the ecb cannot revise its mandate until the current storm has passed but with water pouring in it cannot afford to wait very long the sooner the ecb does what is needed to restore its credibility the sooner it can do what is needed to protect itself from future storms marcel fratzscher a former senior manager at the european central bank is president

the stock market is hitting new all time highs with it many of investors favorite stocks are becoming rather expensive there are certainly fewer cheap value stocks today than there were last december that s for sure but don t despair the rise in the s p 500 and other stock market indexes hasn t caused all stocks to rise uniformly many companies have missed out on the rally some of these value stocks are held back by headline news such as the trade war others of these value stocks are overlooked for more subtle reasons regardless it s time to start sleuthing out some of the market s best holiday deals before the new year kicks off here are seven value stocks that need to be on your radar now investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips value stocks to buy intel intc after a big earnings beat can intel stock continue its momentum source sundry photography shutterstock com like several of the companies on this list intel nasdaq intc is currently dogged by trade war concerns the lack of certainty around the future of u s china business relations puts a crimp on semiconductor spending this has caused intc stock to stall out just below the key 60 resistance level yet again despite sharply improving operating metrics in recent quarters even as intel stock has moved higher in recent years the price to earnings ratio has failed to expand to any meaningful degree now at 56 per share intel sells for just 12 times forward earnings intel s earnings you should remember are up from less than 2 50 per share in recent years to more than 4 per share today yet the market is still pricing intel as though it were a little to no growth business this idea that intel is just a stagnant pc chip business really needs to be retired the company has heavily invested in all sorts of new growth avenues to move beyond its legacy cash cow intel s strides in autonomous vehicles are particularly impressive yet it still sells at a bargain bin price all the better for investors buying intel stock today however intel pays a healthy dividend and has bought back more than 1 billion shares of intc stock over the course of this decade story continues sooner or later the market will catch on to the huge earnings growth and capital return story that intel is offering its shareholders wells fargo wfc source kristi blokhin shutterstock com beloved by warren buffett and known for its sterling reputation wells fargo nyse wfc used to be the cream of the banking crop then the scandal headlines and customer lawsuits started hitting and wells fargo s reputation went from outstanding to infamous virtually overnight with it so did wells fargo s valuation despite a roaring stock market in general and earnings growth at wells fargo over the past five years wfc stock has gone absolutely nowhere five years ago in december wfc stock sold for 55 per share now it is at 54 in that time it s gone from being highly priced to being a deep value stock why is it time to forgive wfc for its mistakes and buy into the story today for one all the old management has been cleaned out the company has gotten rid of those with ties to the scandals and brought in highly respected former visa nyse v ceo charles scharf two the company is set for massive earnings growth in coming years it is buying back 10 of its stock annually which boosts earnings per share plus wells fargo has billions in extra legal and compliance costs right now related to the bad customer practices of yesteryear as those costs wind down going forward profits will surge even assuming flat revenues due to the difficult interest rate environment wells fargo should be able to get to 6 of eps over the next two years which would lead to 35 upside for the stock assuming a reasonable 12x 13x p e ratio suncor su ses stock is purely speculative and likely to trend lower source kodda shutterstock com most investors hate energy stocks right now it s not hard to see why oil prices crashed in 2014 and have failed to meaningfully recover since then meanwhile natural gas has been getting more and more oversupplied with every passing year energy prices have been in steady retreat so the industry has faced a calamitous downturn smaller exploration and production companies have been going bankrupt in droves and things haven t been looking too good for the midstream pipeline companies either don t throw out the baby with the bathwater though the major oil companies are still great investments in fact the longer oil prices stay down the better the oil majors will do when the cycle finally turns up again that s because the shortage of capital in the industry now is forcing severe layoffs and cutbacks on expansion plans in future years supply will drop significantly thanks to the absence of new production efforts on top of that the majors have been buying up assets on the cheap to take advantage of current market conditions that s where suncor nyse su comes in the canadian integrated oil giant has been quietly building an oil sands production and refining empire over the past decade oil sands have become one of the world s cheapest sources of oil with suncor producing for just 25 per barrel or so it also has supplies to last for many decades oil sands unlike shale do not deplete quickly suncor s refining capacity has also insulated it from low crude oil prices in north america as it can sell higher value gasoline and other finished petroleum products add it all up and suncor is a cash flow machine it is offering a 12 cash flow yield giving it room to pay a 4 dividend yield which it tends to hike by double digits every year the company also has enough left over to both buy back stock and pay down debt when oil prices turn up suncor stock will be set for a massive rally altria mo despite headwinds altria stock is still a solid long term opportunity source kristi blokhin shutterstock com tobacco leader altria nyse mo isn t quite the cheapest of value stocks at least not compared to a month or two ago altria shares have recovered from 40 to 50 but don t think you re too late altria is still a relative bargain today keep in mind that mo stock traded as high as 75 per share not that long ago it s not hard to see why altria stock crashed the company has seen its cigarette sales volumes decline more aggressively in recent years the annual declines have moved from low single digits to closer to 5 this makes it hard to keep revenues flat or increasing merely from price hikes altria seemingly panicked as a result and paid way too much for its minority stake in vaping leader juul investors have punished altria mercilessly for this ill timed blunder as the federal government has cracked down on vaping juul s valuation has sunk however the worst is over for mo stock see the bears can t have it both ways if cigarette sales decline sharply people are going to want to get nicotine from another source of which vaping is the easiest alternative meanwhile if the federal government limits vaping too much people will simply go back to cigarettes as long as people crave their nicotine altria will get its revenues one way or another the government has seemingly realized this and is now backing down on some of the harsher vaping rules molson coors brewing tap source oleksandrshnuryk shutterstock com if cigarettes and vaping aren t up your alley how about beer this brings us to molson coors brewing nyse tap which makes those namesake beer brands along with other well known labels such as miller and blue moon the company acquired 100 ownership of miller along with many other assets in 2016 when anheuser busch inbev nyse bud acquired sabmiller and regulators forced the combined entity to sell off some brands for antitrust reasons molson coors took advantage and grabbed these assets at a seemingly favorable price however it took on a lot of debt to complete the deal and combined with weak sales in recent years its financial results have underwhelmed this in turn has caused investors to dump tap making it one my favorite value stocks it s down from a high of 110 to just 51 now however the tide is starting to turn the balance sheet is getting stronger and management just rewarded shareholders for their patience with a gigantic dividend hike this year as a result tap stock now trades for just 12x earnings and pays a 4 5 dividend yield the craft beer movement has already lost steam craft is barely taking any additional share from big beer it s only a matter of time until molson coors gets revenue growth to kick in again and the stock should move back up above 15x earnings leading to sizable capital gains on top of the healthy dividend yield eastman chemical emn source michael vi shutterstock com with its recent selloff eastman chemical nyse emn is back into the deep value stocks zone emn stock is now going for just 10x earnings traders have dumped shares of the former eastman kodak spinoff thanks to the trade war which has caused a bit of an earnings slowdown eastman was originally supposed to make about 7 75 in eps this year now it will be closer to 7 20 regardless for a 75 stock that s fantastic impressively eastman is on track to produce more than 1 billion in cash flow this year meaning it is selling for less than 10x that metric with all that cash eastman can pay a 3 3 dividend yield buy back stock and pay down debt all at the same time investors aren t enthused for chemicals stocks right now because they are seen as cyclical that plus global trade concerns have the sector in the penalty box make no mistake though if this federal reserve easing cycle leads to any signs of an economic pick up in 2020 these left for dead chemical stocks like eastman should come roaring back corporacion america airports caap source shutterstock finally we get to the last of our value stocks and this one is deeply under followed that s because corporacion america airports nyse caap is both a fairly recent initial public offering and a company whose operations are centered in argentina the ipo was unfortunately timed as argentina s economy soon went into a tailspin after caap stock started trading on the new york stock exchange to make matters worse argentina voted in a left wing government this fall triggering a rout on argentine stocks add it all up and caap stock has hit massive turbulence dumping from the ipo of 16 per share to just 4 now oddly enough given the fall in stock price the actual business is still going reasonably well the company has a healthy balance sheet and passenger traffic is still rising across its portfolio of airports caap gets about 60 of its airport traffic from argentine airports but it also has major holdings in brazil italy ecuador and various other countries as a result the market has now crushed caap stock for a 75 loss despite the fact that only 60 of its business is in argentina even if argentina goes into an economic depression the other airports should more than support the stock price here if the argentina airports face a moderate decline in traffic and the rest of the portfolio performs as is the stock would be trading for less than 5x its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization that s an insane price for an airport operator publicly traded comparables in mexico sell for around 12x ebitda european airport operators tend to sell for 15x 20x ebitda currently another emerging markets airport operator in thailand is selling for nearly 25x just getting to 12x where mexican airports sell for would cause caap stock to nearly quadruple from today s prices there s no guarantee it will happen but the odds favor an upturn in sentiment toward argentina rather than a further darkening from the already despondent mood when things turn back up caap stock should soar at the time of this writing ian bezek owned emn intc wfc su caap mo and tap stock you can reach him on twitter at irbezek more from

johannesburg zimbabwe s central bank has asked the international monetary fund to overlook the country s shortcomings in achieving fiscal targets and allow a program to help restore the economy to run its course eddie cross a member of the monetary policy committee who attended the meetings held with the washington based lender s delegation on thursday said policy makers expected a tough report from the imf team which is in the country until wednesday dec 11 to review progress under a staff monitored program we asked them to recognise the achievements we have made in such a short space of time cross said in an interview in the capital harare we urged them to recognise that our fundamentals are now sound cross said some of the achievements include a reduction in the budget deficit the establishment of an interbank market and reducing state employee costs an electronic interbank system will go live later this month as the central bank tries to bring transparency into the trading system so far 15 lenders have confirmed their participation however the gains have been overshadowed by the worst economic crisis in a decade inflation surged to 38 percent in october and while the statistics agency has stopped publishing an annual price growth rate cross puts it at 400 percent according to bloomberg calculations based on the statistics office s consumer price index data the rate was 440 percent in october a drought has also left nearly half the population of 14 million people food insecure rising food costs forced the government to make an about turn on scrapping grain subsidies the government will shoulder this cost and it s likely to attract scrutiny from the imf after it called for tighter monetary measures and curbs on government spending in its last review the staff monitored program is seen as a precursor to getting debt relief that is needed to restore the economy and is due to end in march cross said he was sure that the imf would grudgingly agree to let the program run its course

cnn sen elizabeth warren has big plans for america if she s elected president the massachusetts senator would provide free health care for everyone she would wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions of people and give free child care to millions of kids she would increase social security benefits by 200 a month and invest heavily in clean energy technology these big ideas along with others the 2020 democratic candidate has announced come with an equally big price tag more than 30 trillion over 10 years if enacted her proposals would balloon federal spending by more than 50 over a decade on top of the nearly 58 trillion already projected by the congressional budget office to pay for it warren would increase taxes on the wealthy corporations and wall street while expecting employers and states to chip in too she s got a very very ambitious you might almost call it a muscular program of what government should do said william gale senior fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution it s firmly based on the idea that some problems lend themselves to government solutions better than others do it s a no apologies approach to policy warren and her 2020 democratic rival sen bernie sanders are proposing a major expansion of government involvement in americans lives as a way to boost the middle and working classes they stand in contrast to former vice president joe biden and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg whose plans call for a more moderate broadening of federal spending in addition to her spending proposals warren also wants to wield the government s power to help consumers and smaller businesses her accountable capitalism plan would require very large corporations to consider the interests of all stakeholders not just shareholders and she would mandate that workers at big companies elect no less than 40 of board members warren also wants to use federal power to break up large industries such as big tech and big ag and increase oversight on wall street it s not about big government or small government said bharat ramamurti the campaign s deputy policy director for economic policy it s about who government works for warren s vision harkens back to the major social programs of earlier eras president franklin d roosevelt launched a series of federal initiatives known as the new deal in the 1930s to stabilize the nation and help it recover from the great depression some efforts such as the works progress administration which provided jobs for the unemployed were short term but others including social security unemployment insurance and federal agricultural subsidies still exist roughly three decades after the new deal president lyndon b johnson spearheaded the great society which wove the government even deeper into the nation s social fabric it created medicare and medicaid as well as head start and other anti poverty environmental and consumer protection initiatives warren continues in this tradition taking the view that government involvement can be beneficial said julian zelizer history professor at princeton university and cnn contributor what s more he said one of her central issues is that america s free market philosophy has left the middle class struggling which is why government needs to step in to provide crucial services she wants to make the argument that s why we need a different path right now zelizer said the largest of warren s proposals is her medicare for all plan which would create a national health insurance system that would cover everyone at no cost but it would increase federal spending by 20 5 trillion over a decade which she plans to cover mainly by requiring contributions from employers and by raising taxes on the wealthy corporations and wall street she says she d aim to implement the program the brainchild of sanders by the end of her first term warren also wants to invest 2 trillion in researching developing and manufacturing clean energy technology to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 warren would spend another 1 trillion on additional protections for workers and transitioning american infrastructure and industry away from fossil fuels she would beef up social security benefits at a cost of 3 1 trillion and provide free or subsidized universal child care which comes with a 1 trillion price tag and warren would make all public colleges tuition free while eliminating the student loan debt of tens of millions of americans she also wants to invest in k 12 education and affordable housing warren maintains all this additional spending would be covered by taxes and would greatly boost economic growth by helping millions of middle class americans but some budget watchers are worried that her plans do not include reining in the nation s debt the us budget deficit soared to nearly 1 trillion for the 2019 fiscal year the treasury department reported last month largely due to the 2017 republican backed tax cuts

by frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer for us global investors another year another thanksgiving i hope all of my american friends and readers had the chance to spend some quality time with family as we begin the busy holiday shopping season the leading retail trade group expects sales in november and december to increase as much as 4 2 percent over last year for a total potential value of 730 7 billion part of this growth is due to the market selloff that happened at the end of 2018 but there s more to the story than that as i recently told you the u s purchasing manager s index pmi a leading indicator of economic activity turned up for the third straight month in november this is a good reflection of healthy demand and a possible signal of further upside there s still a month left to 2019 and yet stocks are already up an incredible 28 percent below are some more need to know numbers you might have missed from this last week 0 01 increase for a thanksgiving dinner one of the more interesting ways to measure u s inflation is by tracking the annual price of a typical thanksgiving dinner for 10 that s what the american farm bureau federation afbf has been doing for the past 34 years and in its most recent survey the group found that the total cost was effectively flat rising only 0 01 from 48 90 in 2018 to 48 91 today that s as little as 5 per person as evercore isi pointed out in a research note this week the cost of a thanksgiving dinner is lower now than it was eight years ago the first time we ve seen that since 1947 americans continue to enjoy the most affordable food supply in the world commented afbf chief economist john newton 55 million travelers if you traveled at all last week i hope you planned ahead an estimated 55 million people in the u s were expected to hit the road or take to the skies this thanksgiving season up 1 6 million people or nearly 3 percent from last year according to the american automobile association aaa that s the most people since 2005 looking at air travel alone some 4 45 million americans are expected to fly on domestic airlines an annual increase of 4 6 percent 10 billion stake in u s airlines speaking of airlines in last week s equity and bond report murenbeeld co analysts brian bosse and chantelle schieven brought to our attention a lesson inspired by warren buffett namely investors must change when the facts change as recently as 12 years ago buffett was famously warning investors to steer clear of the airline industry which had been destroying capital at least since deregulation in 1978 after the industry consolidated and restructured a couple of years later however airlines have committed themselves to capacity growth discipline and returning value to shareholders when an industry changes from reliably destroying shareholder capital into providing reliable positive returns which create economic value then astute investors should take notice boose and schieven write buffett certainly took notice and today his stake in the big four carriers stands at just under 10 billion another industry that murenbeeld co call out for transforming from money wasters to money spinners the mining industry 3 7 billion deal like airlines before it the gold mining industry is seeking to improve shareholder value through consolidation among other means last week we learned that kirkland lake gold will be buying rival detour gold in an all stock deal valued at c 4 9 billion 3 7 billion this is just the latest deal in the current wave of consolidation that began last year with the barrick randgold deal and newmont goldcorp deal 12 trillion in negative yielding debt one of the key drivers of the price of gold this year has been the surging mountain of negative yielding government bonds according to murenbeeld this amount as of november is a mind boggling 12 trillion that s down from 17 trillion in august but if you look below you ll see that more than half and in some cases close to 100 percent of some economies outstanding debt is trading at negative yields 16 700 percent return in 50 years last week marked 50 years since the debut of the hang seng index the widely quoted gauge of the 50 largest companies trading in hong kong from its launch in november 1969 the hang seng is up some 16 700 percent making it the world s best performing stock index by a wide margin originally intended as a measure of local firms the hang seng has increasingly become a proxy of china s economy today about half of the hang seng is represented by mainland chinese heavyweights such as tencent china mobile and geely automotive shares of chinese e commerce giant alibaba began trading in hong kong for the first time last week with a market cap of 4 trillion hong kong dollars 513 billion alibaba is already the city s biggest stock meaning we ll likely see it join the hang seng possibly as soon as its next rebalance again i hope everyone had a blessed holiday weekend i often say that

washington dc abhijit banerjee and esther duflo two of this year s recipients of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences are the latest among leading economists to remind us that gross domestic product is an imperfect measure of human welfare the human development index published by the united nations development programme aggregates indicators of life expectancy education and per capita income and has long been available as an alternative to per capita income alone in 2008 joseph e stiglitz amartya sen and jean paul fitoussi outlined the many failures of gdp for the french government sponsored commission on the measurement of economic performance and social progress subsequent oecd sponsored work elaborated on their findings and related research by the brookings institution s carol graham on subjective wellbeing and duke university s matthew adler on the measurement of social welfare has received well deserved acclaim nonetheless gdp continues to reign supreme in the halls of power policymakers around the world are constantly awaiting the latest quarterly data on gdp growth and variations of one tenth of a percentage point are regarded as significant indicators of macroeconomic performance the international monetary fund s world economic outlook may include in depth analysis across a wide range of topics but it always starts with gdp to see why treating gdp growth as a proxy for progress even in terms of income alone is highly problematic consider the case of a country with 10 citizens and a gdp of 190 where nine citizens start with 10 each and the tenth citizen starts with 100 moreover assume that gdp is equal to national income so that net factor income from abroad is zero now imagine that the first nine citizens experience no income growth in a given year while the tenth enjoys a 10 per cent increase gdp will have increased from 190 to 200 implying an annual growth rate of approximately 5 26 per cent this is reflected in the usual way national income is computed individuals are weighed by their share of total income and that 5 26 per cent rate represents a weighted average in which the income growth of the 10th citizen counts nine times more than that of each of the other nine citizens contrast this example with one in which the same country uses a democratically measured growth rate weighing each individual equally as a share of the population rather than as a share of total income here the growth rate would reflect the weighted sum of nine zero per cent growth rates and one 10 per cent growth rate each weighed at one 10th with a resulting total growth rate of 1 per cent the weighing of individuals by their share of income is not generally perceived by the public but this implicit practice is important to point out because it enshrines the principle of one dollar one vote rather than one person one vote it is essential for assessing the total size of a market or the economic power of a country but it does not capture an economy s performance for its citizens this is hardly the only reason why gdp is an inadequate measure of human wellbeing it also ignores people s need for respect dignity liberty health rule of law community and a clean environment but even if all of these other democratic goods were satisfied gdp still would fail as a metric of progress purely in terms of income alone building on work by the economists thomas piketty emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman the center for equitable growth has proposed gdp 2 0 a metric that would complement existing aggregate gdp reports by disaggregating the income growth of different cross sections of the population such as income quintiles providing this kind of distributional picture regularly would require increased coordination among government departments as well as some conventions on for example how to use tax data to complement the usual national accounts but conventions are also needed for existing national income accounting provided that distributional data are routinely available one could compute a growth rate based on the weighted average across each decile of the income distribution with equal weighting for population as in the example above individuals would still be weighed by their incomes within each group which is why it would be preferable to use deciles rather than quintiles but the final product would be much closer than current methods to the democratic ideal one of the main advantages of gdp growth is that it is expressed with a single number whereas other performance indicators either are presented within dashboards comprising multiple metrics or aggregated in essentially arbitrary ways the implicit use of income shares as aggregation weights is perfectly appropriate for macroeconomic analysis and is not arbitrary the problem arises when gdp becomes a proxy for progress what we can measure easily and communicate elegantly inevitably determines what we will focus on as a matter of policy as the stiglitz sen fitoussi report put it what we measure affects what we do publishing a democratic metric like the growth rate of gdp 2 0 is no pipedream a gdp growth rate using equal weights for each decile of the population would also produce a single number to complement the usual growth rate true it still would not capture the substantial differences within the top decile in many countries where the top 1 per cent have been gaining disproportionately compared to everyone else and we still would need other metrics to measure performance in dimensions other than income but as a single figure published alongside gdp growth it could go a long way toward changing the dominant conversation about economic performance kemal dervi former minister of economic affairs of

approximation for measuring economic activity in the country s business landscape contracted 4 3 percent against a contraction of 1 percent in the previous month due to subdued performance across segments barring intermediate goods analysts expect the iip in october to see further contraction around 5 percent due to consistent weakness in major segments core industries which are 40 percent of iip declined 5 8 percent in october on the other side retail inflation in november is likely to inch up further over 5 percent against 4 62 percent in the previous month due to higher food inflation higher cpi numbers due to supply constraints will also act as an impediment for quick economic growth the sooner the cpi numbers cool down the better it is for economic recovery jimeet modi said after its policy meeting on december 5 rbi raised its cpi inflation projection upwards to 5 1 4 7 percent for second half fy20 but downwards to 4 3 8 percent for the first half of fy21 oil prices international benchmark brent crude futures rallied more than 3 percent and wti over 7 percent during the last week after opec members agreed for additional cuts of 5 00 000 bpd for the first quarter of 2020 taking total production cut to 1 7 million barrels per day the opec nations surprised with additional cuts to avoid the oversupply in the global oil market but there was a new development after the friday meet with russia wherein saudi arabia stated that the total oil production cuts implemented will be 2 1 mbpd currently they were limiting its oil production by 1 2 mbpd as agreed by the members during 2018 saudi further said that they will continue to voluntary cut its oil production by 4 00 000 bpd if all producers strictly maintain its full quota the reason behind this move is the group expected the demand slowdown in the first half of 2020 and us continue with its expansion plans after this move the global demand supply picture balanced a little with the market showing a smaller surplus of 0 5mbpd into the first half of 2020 said sakina mandsaurwala commodity analyst at narnolia financial advisors she expects this opec move to help balance the oil market and keep prices supportive at 55 per barrel on the nymex also if the us china signs the phase one trade agreement it would further boost the investor sentiment and help oil prices rally she said ujjivan small

by richard m ebeling the spanish philosopher george santayana 1863 1952 is usually credited with the phrase those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it nowhere is this truer than with the renewed idea and demand for the establishment of a socialist economic system a noticeable number of intellectuals inside and outside the ivy tower of academia as well as a vocal segment of those on the progressive side of american politics are insisting on the desirability and necessity for ending the neo liberal capitalist system and replacing it with a democratic socialism dedicated to social justice identity politics and relatively comprehensive centralized planning of economic and social affairs listening to and reading the arguments of these proponents of the new socialism you would think that nothing had happened over the last one hundred years that in any way shape or form had anything to do with the case for and likely consequences from introducing socialism into 21 st century society in their minds what have been considered to be socialist regimes in the 20 th century were either false forms of socialism not representing what a real socialism could and would look like or they were socialisms that went wrong because the wrong people were in political power in socialist countries around the world or the full possibilities and potentials of those socialist experiments were undermined and weakened due to american imperialist interference trying to make them fail or the new socialists just try to ignore the history of socialism over the last one hundred years sending it all down an orwellian memory hole early anti socialists warned of tyranny and plunder their naïve optimism and confidence might have been understandable and even excusable before the first world war before then socialism was still primarily a political ideal and dream of those wanting to make over society so mankind could have a beautiful and more just and prosperous future but even then in the 19 th century critics of the socialist promise warned in often amazingly prescient ways given all that has happened over the last one hundred years what socialism in practice would really mean those earlier critics of socialism warned that a triumphant socialism would mean a terrible tyranny socialism would mean comprehensive government ownership and control over all the means of production such total control by those in political power and directing the central planning of all economic activities in the society would hold the destiny of everyone in their hands a socialist government would determine where and how you lived the type of work and employment opportunities you had the education that you and your children would be allowed the types and quantities of goods to which you would have access as well as the political cultural and philosophical ideas you would be permitted to read and learn about and discuss nothing would be outside of the restricting reach of the socialist state of the future each person would be nothing more than a cog in the collectivist machine commanded controlled and when necessary coerced to serve and be sacrificed for the wider and more important socialist good in spite of all the rhetoric and promise of the liberation of man under the socialism to come the actual individual human being would be lost in the collective mass of the people as a whole for which all that the socialist state implemented was the rationale and justification the critics of socialism also warned that human nature was not a moldable putty to be remade into a new altruistic man unconcerned with personal self interest once common ownership had replaced private ownership over the means of production and once a new generation had arisen that was sufficiently re educated by the state to have been freed from bourgeois thinking attitudes and proclivities of focusing on the self rather than the group all that would have changed was the institutional setting within which human nature manifested and played itself out such extensive and monopolized economic power as would exist under socialism would merely mean the motives and incentives would be shifted to gaining political control over the state to use its power to benefit oneself and others important to oneself at the expense of everyone else see my article john stuart mill and the dangers of unrestrained government early criticisms of economic planning finally a number of these critics of socialism pointed out the inherent unworkability of a socialist central planning system once private property competition and market based prices had been abolished through the nationalization of the means of production by the government how would producers know what to produce if competitive supply and demand did not generate the market prices to tell producers what it was that consumers wanted and the relative value they placed on those goods indeed how could supply and demand be brought into coordinated balance if market based and changing prices did not constantly and continuously adjust the two sides of the market how would competent directors of production be selected with the end of private enterprise absent entrepreneurs to direct those enterprises who had proven their worth through winning profits and avoiding losses how would labor be efficiently and effectively directed in their employments for assisting in the manufacture of the goods that consumers wanted if in the name of social justice wages were determined by the socialist redistributors of income rather than by market guiding wage incentives world war i ushers in government central planning virtually all of these earlier criticisms of socialism were ignored and went unanswered for the most part the socialists of that time set them aside as the misplaced rationalizations for those trying to defend the unjust immoral and exploitative capitalist system they were rearguard attempts to hold off the future by confusing the workers concerning the truth of the terrible system under which they lived there was a right side of history and it was the socialist society to come see my articles karl marx and a presumption of a right side to history part i and part ii but with the first world war and its immediate aftermath socialism was no longer a dream a promise of the future ahead of mankind the future had arrived during the conflict the belligerent governments on all sides had introduced systems of government planning to one degree or another in the name of marshaling the resources of the nation in the service of winning the war then in the midst of the war in november 1917 lenin and his bolshevik party overthrew the russian provisional government that had replaced the monarchy when the czar abdicated in february 1917 the declared goal was the overthrow of capitalism and the instituting of a socialist economy lenin s government soon implemented what he called war communism an immediate leap into full socialism as the means to harness and direct those parts of russia under its control in the civil war that broke out in 1918 between the bolshevik regime and the anti communist white armies then in 1919 short lived soviet regimes came to power in bavaria and hungary the democratic socialists running the postwar german government in berlin organized a socialization commission to study and plan the replacing of german private enterprise with a socialist economic system ludwig von mises challenges the workability of socialism in the face of all of this in 1920 the austrian economist ludwig von mises 1881 1973 published an article offering a devastating critique of economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth it was expanded into a full and detailed treatise challenging all facets and forms of collectivism two years later in a book that in its english translation has the title socialism an economic and sociological analysis 1922 revised eds 1932 1951 thus the year 2020 marks the one hundredth anniversary of ludwig von mises s demonstration of the inherent and inescapable unworkability of a socialist central planning system though spiced in a few places with biting and satirical rhetoric about the socialist vision of the world mises s 1920 article and the book that followed are serious and methodical analyses of the institutional nature of a socialist economic system and the limits and barriers it places in the way of rational and efficient decision making of the scarce resources of society for satisfying consumer wants in a social setting without private property markets and prices mises wished not to question the benevolent sincerity of those wanting to establish a system of central planning the core of his argument makes no presumptions or accusations that those in charge of the socialist society will be malevolent tyrants or abusers of their political power to benefit themselves in addition he makes no assumption that come the socialist society individuals will be any less industrious and motivated to be as productive as they currently are found to be in private enterprise market oriented societies instead he asked when socialism will have nationalized the means of production and placed it in the hands of those directing the central planning of the society when as a result markets and competition for the purchase and sale of the factors of production will no longer exist and when as a consequence there will be no existing price system for the factors of production how will the central planners know the most highly valued and cost efficient uses and allocations of the land labor and capital under their command and control retail prices might exist and function under socialism his answer in a nutshell they will not know it could be imagined that prices might still exist for consumer goods instead of a strict allocational rationing by the state the central planners will have decided how much of the various consumer items to produce in a given period and offer them for sale in the people s retail stores at prices set by the government existing inventories might be bought up more quickly than the central planners had anticipated or unwanted inventories might accumulate on the shelves because they were not the quantities or types of goods the citizens of the socialist society wanted to buy this would indicate the need for the central planning agency to raise retail prices to slow down the rate of purchase to prevent wanted goods from disappearing from the state retail stores too quickly until the next shipments arrived and the need to lower other retail prices to clear out the unwanted inventory of those goods in lesser demand this would also indicate mises said the need for the central planners to increase the output and availability of the former goods and reduce the planned production of the latter goods no prices for production goods means no economic calculation but the real question was in mises s view how would the central planners decide how best to produce the various goods with the means of production at their disposal land labor and capital are made up of physically distinct and technically varying possibilities for allocation and use this is not merely in the general sense that some physical means of production might be usable for say making hats but not for making cough syrup but that there exists wide and intricate ranges of possible complementarity and substitutability in terms of what combinations of these physical means of production might be used to make any number of different and competing finished goods in varying amounts that consumers want how could their respective values be expressed for determining what relative quantities might be their highest valued production use in one direction versus some other at the margin of decision making in the market economy this is made possible because rival private enterprisers compete for their purchase hire or rent in markets in which they are bought and sold in addition all of these heterogeneous and physically different means of production are reduced to a valuational common denominator in terms of the money prices at which there are bids and offers for those factors of production on the supply side of the market this enables the private enterprisers to estimate and appraise whether particular lines of production would generate profits or create losses if they seem possibly profit making the money prices for those factors of production enable a working judgment about which combinations of them might provide the least cost expenditures on the supply side to bring the good in question to market the problem that the socialist planners will face is that they will have done away with all the institutional prerequisites for this type of rational economic calculation with the abolition of private ownership of the means of production and therefore an end to markets and prices for their purchase hire or rent existing socialist societies did not imply economic rationality in several places in his 1920 article and in his later book on socialism mises made the stark statement that this meant that socialism was impossible as an economic system many critics later ridiculed this extreme statement of his as patently incorrect was there not the soviet union and after the second world war many other socialist societies that existed with systems of central planning that were producing allocating and distributing goods and services these planned economies had not disintegrated away into the planned chaos about which mises had many times warned in retrospect it is clear that mises s choice of words in the excitement of coming to his conclusions about a socialist economy was not perfectly chosen and he in fact in several places found it necessary to clarify what he had meant in speaking about the impossibility of socialism first he said that he was not suggesting that a centrally planned society could not exist it could and obviously did in the face of the soviet experiment with central planning the question was not whether a central planning agency could or could not allocate the factors of production under their control and command into various uses according to the plan designed and implemented the issue was whether the planning agency had the institutional ability to do so with the same rationality and cost efficiency in value terms as a functioning competitive market economy would the scarce means of production be allocated and utilized in a manner of getting the most out of those means as was possible not in technical terms but in terms of their distribution among alternative productions that reflected their most highly valued allocation expressed in the demands of the consuming public in a fully and comprehensive socialist society the answer had to be no with no private property in the means of production there is nothing legally to buy and sell with no buying and selling there are no potential gains from trade with no potential gains from trade there are no bids and offers and no haggling of the marketplace without bids and offers there are no agreed upon terms of trade without established terms of trade there are no prices without market generated prices there is no way to know what individuals who otherwise could compete for the use of those factors of production in a market economy really think them to be worth as stepping stones to hopefully earning profits by producing what consumers want and better than one s closest rivals who are also competing for consumer business in the same or other markets socialism is impossible in the sense mises was arguing in that it was institutionally unable to create incentives and opportunities for rational decision making concerning the use of society s scarce means in service of the consumers ends in any way approaching the efficiency and effectiveness of competitive capitalism the socialist ship would be like a sailing vessel on a cloud covered night out of sight of land without a working sextant or a functioning rudder to enable workable economic calculation the socialist ship could be moving about but had it selected the best means for moving the ship through the water and was it getting to where it wanted to go in the least time with the smallest expense of resource use to get there the central planning captains of the socialist ship would have no way of knowing the soviet economy was a socialist island in a sea of capitalism in addition mises made the point many times over the years that the soviet experiment was not occurring in a hermetically sealed economic environment having to operate totally on its own in trying to decide what and how to produce the soviet island of socialism existed in an ocean of surrounding market based societies as a consequence the soviet central planners were able to make more rational decisions than otherwise would have been the case because they would use what today is referred to as the shadow prices of neighboring market economies though the circumstances prevailing in those market economies did not have any one to one parallel with the conditions in say the soviet union they did offer guides and indicators for the soviet planners directing their methods for more rationally applying and using the means at their disposal for the ends they had decided upon this was no different mises explained than those instances of municipal socialism that existed even before the first world war in which towns and cities socialized various municipal services such as waterworks gas and electric supplies or bus and trolley rides within their local jurisdictions prices in the wider market in which these socialist services were provided for free or at a government determined price could still sort out whether they were using the resources they controlled for the supplying of these goods and services in cost efficient ways because many of the inputs used were still bought and sold and had prices usable for purposes of economic calculation market socialism offered as a reply to mises in the 1930s a number of socialists tipped their hats to mises for having emphasized and reminded the advocates of central planning that every economic system whether capitalist or socialist has to have an institutional mechanism for making rational cost decisions in determining how best to use the means of production to effectively fulfill the chosen ends prices were essential for making this possible and to be expressed in a monetary common denominator indeed one of the most famous of these socialists the polish economist oskar lange 1904 1965 even sarcastically proposed that in the socialist society of the future a statue of ludwig von mises should stand at the entrance to the central planning agency for reminding every good socialist how important prices were to successfully fulfill the socialist goals the answer lange and others gave to mises s challenge was to propose versions of market socialism the central planning agency would initially set prices for the various factors of production the factory managers of the socialist enterprises would be told to act as if they were attempting to minimize costs and maximize profits in other words they were to play at being private enterprisers buying the factors of production at the prices set by the planning agency though they were working for and being paid by the state and any profits earned primarily would be passed on to the central government if it was discovered that at the prices set by the central planning agency there was experienced surpluses or shortages in the supplies of the factors of production the central planners would change those prices up or down to move them into the direction of equilibrium just like private markets do it was claimed the central planning authority would retain ultimate decision making authority however concerning the allocation of capital otherwise the managers of the socialist state enterprises might attempt to expand or contract their physical capacities to produce output in directions inconsistent with the socially desirable goals and needs of the people as determined by the higher central planning decision makers mises had already anticipated and answered the market socialists lange and other socialists made their cases for market socialism as if they had found an undiscussed weakness in mises s original arguments against central planning the truth is that already in the 1920 article and certainly in the more detailed analysis in his book on socialism mises had anticipated much in the market socialist argument and had already responded to it mises pointed out that the real problems of market prices and economic calculation arose from the fact that we live in a changing world if the world was in a stationary equilibrium in which what happened yesterday will happen exactly the same today and tomorrow in turn will be just like the day before the prevailing prices could be used as an indicator of what and how things should be done with the means of production it s when yesterday s prices no longer reflect real supply and demand conditions as they exist today that the problems of economic calculation rise to the foreground first any price adjustments introduced by the central planners will lag behind the changes occurring in the market they will not be modified as quickly and responsively as when the price adjustment decision making is done by the interested and relevant private enterprisers in their respective corners of the market as they experience and discover the changed circumstances to which prices and production plans must adapt second markets and decision making cannot be played at the private enterpriser is risking his own capital or the capital that he has borrowed from others which he is under the obligation to pay back with interest the state enterprise manager is not risking his own economic well being and financial circumstance in the same manner as a private sector counterpart there are no losses to be avoided or profits to be made by the state enterprise manager in the same way as with the private businessman and entrepreneur and third market entrepreneurs and investors are guiding and directing the capital they own and use based on their estimates concerning where market profitability indicates labor resources and capital equipment should be redirected in those changing circumstances over time under market socialism lange and others were very clear that decision making concerning the allocation of capital could not and would not be determined by the state enterprise managers the state enterprise managers horizons went no further than the affairs of the particular firms over which they respectively had oversight the central planner s perspective was the socially necessary capital uses and investment looking at the socialist society as a whole thus the direction of the economy was assigned to the central planning agency and neither to private entrepreneurs guiding capital investment according to market based prices and profitability because they were gone nor by the state employees in charge of the government enterprises this meant that the ultimate use of capital in the socialist society was outside of any economic calculation and thus it was arbitrary based on the judgments of what the planners and the political leaders above them decided was the socially really needed the allocation and use of capital are outside of supply and demand and hence outside of rational decision making it was for these and related reasons that mises stated in 1931 that inasmuch as money prices of the means of production can be determined only in a social order in which they are privately owned the proof of the impracticality of socialism necessarily follows it alone will enable future historians to understand how it came about that the victory of the socialist movement did not lead to the creation of the socialist order of society with the end of the soviet union and the other socialist regimes in eastern europe in the early 1990s the general belief was that socialism and central planning had been shown to be failures neither freedom nor prosperity had been forthcoming government planning had turned out to be a disaster of economic wastefulness with little connection between supply and demand and misallocations and misuses of the means of production overlaid with perks and privileges through a hierarchy power and position within the socialist system the green new deal as a war strategy against global warming but in spite of all this and the debates over the workability of socialism during the last one hundred years the central planning idea is returning with a vengeance it is reflected in the proposal for a green new deal the planet is threatened with destruction due to climate change caused by man through the use of fossil fuels to feed the insatiable human appetite for material wealth and betterment with unhesitating hysteria it is warned that humankind has maybe a dozen or so years to stop and reverse the mounting effects of global warming before the seas rise enough to significantly flood coastal areas around the world rising temperatures will disrupt how and where we all live the death of planet earth is upon us the world can no longer afford the leisure of market based prices production and profit directed decision making so how should the problem of climate change and global warming be tackled the levy economics institute of bard college has recently published a paper how to pay for the green new deal by economists yeva nersisyan and l randall wray who offer what amounts to a central plan for america they insist that the threat of global warming must be viewed as a moral equivalent of war that requires single minded determination and willingness to do whatever it takes to defeat the fossil fuel enemy threatening an end to mankind america must think of the green new deal as this generation s version of pulling all together to defeat the nazis in world war ii back then there was no in between either the nazis won or we did either global warming wins and kills all life as we know it or we win and save the planet in their eyes that is the apocalyptic catastrophe and categorical choice facing humanity marginal decision making has no place clearly in wartime if this vision of mankind s situation is correct no price is too great to succeed the authors insist failure means well the end similar to a nazi victory which would have meant the end to freedom and global civilization the decision set is either or that is categorical and not incremental according to them the technologically possible to save the planet costs don t matter so what is to be done the economy will have to be directed from the center of political decision making and centrally planned they do not use the phrase central planning but a rose by any other name what matters they tell us is technical feasibility not the cost of what is to be done or as they quote another proponent of such policies whatever is technologically possible is financially feasible what is needed is a tabulating of what the resource needs would be to implement the technical requirements of replacing fossil fuel based production with renewable energy sources plus the resources and manpower to do the necessary infrastructure retrofitting and transformations in ways of living and producing that would be consistent with making over all the consumption and production activities in any and all ways that would no longer worsen the environment they admit that there must be some way to add up the costs of utilizing the needed resources and manpower to do all this and they say the easiest way are the monetary expenditures to bring those means of production to bear for the fight against global warming but what becomes the meaning and significance of these prices in the implementation of the green new deal they admit that undertaking this task requires shifting control and use of a significantly larger fraction of gross domestic production gdp over into governmental hands and decision making even when it does not require a literal transfer in the form of direct control government spending to bring about the needed reallocations of labor and resources and forms of production means that any market prices would reflect the central planner s demands for more and more of those resource uses through dollar spending and less on the value estimates of the consuming public through their private demands for goods and services the green new deal is also about social justice goals furthermore the authors say that the green new deal is not only about saving the planet from destruction but reducing income inequality guaranteeing jobs for all assuring a living minimum wage for everyone employed and fulfilling the promise of government provided health care for all plus a grab bag of many other good things increasingly the relative structure of prices and wages would no longer reflect market based and generated estimations of private sector consumer demands and market based appraisements of the opportunity costs of the factors of production in their alternative uses instead replacing it would be government created manipulated and imposed price relationships increasingly representing nothing real outside of the wishes of the green central planners in this circumstance how will the government planners know if they are cost efficiently using the scarce resources of the society for the competing uses of renewable fuel production methods versus health care for all expenditures versus infrastructure retrofitting manufacturing versus guaranteed jobs for everyone that create value added greater than the expense of employing them in ways directed by the government versus all the other rival activities the government will be expected to undertake plus in comparison to what remains as private sector demands and resource uses in society in other words all the marginal decisions and economic calculations do not go away even under a moral equivalent to war to defeat global warming the green new dealers presume bountiful idle resources so how will the green new deal central planners know how and what to do with the equivalence of market based price rationality the answer is the planners will not and cannot know they can assign money prices to various goods resources and labor services they can use prices still partly set by markets where government demands still openly compete with private sector demands but at the end of the day the resulting price structure increasingly has nothing to do with any real and reasonable basis for knowing whether the economy is being managed cost efficiently it is true that the authors make dollar value estimates concerning all the savings that the society will experience from for instance the asserted lower costs that will come from government provided and managed health care compared to the declared far more costly private sector provision of medical treatment the government will bring into use vast amounts of supposedly unemployed or underutilized labor supplies and wasted and idle resources just waiting for government to bring them into production the authors view the situation to use the jargon of the economist as one in which the american economy is operating far within its production possibility frontier of maximum feasible output so large quantities of land labor and capital are idle and wasting away and can be brought into use with no required trade offs of giving up some of one thing to have a bit more of another taxes price controls and compulsory savings to fight inflation to save the planet the government would only have to raise taxes if the economy reached full employment and price inflation were to set in higher taxes would siphon off the inflationary excess demand furthermore in the government s policy toolkit would also be general wage and price controls to fight inflationary threats but they admit that price controls can create shortages due to prices being fixed at levels not able to bring supply and demand into balance if full employment were to threaten to bring an end to their scarcity free war against global warming they have a preferred method of assuring that inflation causing spending does not get out of hand while seeing to it that all the needed resources are freed up to do all the green new deal work to be done inspired by a method proposed by keynes during the second world war about how to pay for the war they advocate the imposing of deferred consumption accounts for the working population rather than any full money wage increases under the pressure of government demand for resources and the resulting inflationary pressures on prices in general part of workers incomes would be shifted into mandatory savings accounts that sometime in the future when one presumes the war against global warming will have been won the accounts could be incrementally cashed out in the meantime income earners would be compelled to participate in a form of forced savings that reduces the level of consumption and the standard of living of the general income earning public as part of the price for victory over climate change but here again the government ends up dictating people s consumption savings ratios rather than income earners deciding on their own subjective personal time preferences concerning present and future consumption and therefore willingness to save all of this intensifies the underlying economic unreality and irrationality of green new deal central planning done away with are the values prices and costs that are only knowable when the people themselves inform each other what it is they want what they think it would be worth paying and what might be the reasonable costs to bring about the supplies of the competing productions to satisfy the market determined and reflected patterns of consumer demand but until tragically scarcity reemerges and forces on the green planners the necessity to choose and trade off among all the wonderful things they want to do there is the miracle of bank credit creation to fund and finance anything and everything that the government needs to do to save the planet and give the country a more intensive and intrusive welfare state and all at the same time according to the authors tragedy of the commons self interest and handling the rising tides if global warming represents the type of danger and threat reflected in the authors hysteria it will be in the personal interests of people as consumers and as profit oriented producers to discover ways to mitigate at the margin the full impact of such environmental change not every inch of coastline is really worth saving from a rising sea if we keep in mind that there are trade offs and marginal costs and benefits that people would and will make if confronted with such a problem if coastal properties are increasingly threatened in the ways feared insurance companies will incrementally nudge up home and property insurance policy premiums to differing degrees depending on where and the estimated degree of threat to insurable real property home and other property owners in these coastal areas would make the needed marginal decisions about the costs worth incurring to reduce the damage risk or to move away part of the futility of implementing an american green new deal to do away with fossil fuels is that global warming by definition is a global problem but it is an element of the tragedy of the atmospheric commons that other nations and their governments might formally or informally decide not to implement any comparable green new deals cartels are historically highly unstable due to cheating among the participants unless the government comes in and uses its threat of coercive penalty to assure an abidance of the rules governments are notorious on cheating when it serves their interests in terms of intergovernmental agreements and there is no super government to dictate terms and conditions and there will not be in any foreseeable future whether or not that is considered to be a good or a bad thing it seems better then to treat any danger from global warming as if it was caused by purely natural forces in the planet s own cycles of heating and cooling something in other words not man made that we can stop but to which we can only adapt and adjust to the best of our ability fully privatization not green planning to deal with global warming to assure the greatest incentives and flexibility to do so we should take to heart the lesson from ludwig von mises s critique of socialist central planning that is it is necessary to privatize as many such common areas and spaces as is in any way possible to internalize the externalities caused by man and nature and thereby create the incentives and profitable opportunities for people to discover the methods and find the mutually beneficial trade offs to minimize the individual and therefore cumulative social damages that such environmental change may bring with it privatizing as many of these common areas as is possible means that we bring them into the arena of markets and prices by doing so we introduce the rationality of economic calculation into areas in which that had not been possible before or far less completely and once we do we know the market based cost and value of something we discover what it is worth to have and to hold to preserve or improve or to set it aside because it s not worth it relative to the alternatives it may be a century now since ludwig von mises offered his famous critique on the impossibility of rational economic calculation under socialist central planning but the renewed call for a new democratic socialism and a green new deal of government planning shows that his argument remains as relevant today as when he penned it a hundred years ago this article is based on a paper delivered at the annual meeting of the society for the development of austrian economics in fort lauderdale florida november 25 2019 and originally apperaed online at aier org dear bob i have a new article on socialism and the green new deal are economically impossible this coming year 2020 marks the hundredth anniversary of the publication of austrian economist ludwig von mises s famous article economic calculation in the socialist commonwealth which appeared in german in 1920 and which was expanded into a full length book on every facet of socialism two years later in 1922 in this article and the later book mises demonstrated the inherent and inescapable unworkability of a centrally planned economy once government has done away with private ownership in the means of production and the resulting end to market competition and a functioning price system on the supply side of the economy what i try to show in my article is that mises s argument against socialist planning is more than a closed episode in the history of economic ideas with the rise of the new call for democratic socialism and the demand for a green new deal his critique of the command and control economy this time in the name of saving the planet from global warming is just as if not more relevant than ever in the face of what is actually being proposed for ending any sort of functioning competitive market economy by implementing the demand for a green system of central planning best richard

workers and investors got an early christmas gift with a blowout november jobs report that showed the u s economy is still capable of creating jobs and sustaining wage gains above the rate of inflation but the fly in the ointment is persistent trade war worry it indicates that the labor market is defying gravity as we enter the end of the year said glassdoor com senior economist daniel zhao economists said the addition of 266 000 new jobs nearly all of which 254 000 came from the private sector reflected how the labor market is pulling the disengaged and underemployed off the sidelines the labor market continues to be more than robust enough to continue to absorb new workers the unemployment and underemployment rates are going down at the same time said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute the two numbers often have an inverse relationship he said moving in tandem is an indication that there is a demand for more workers and that the labor force is meeting that demand at 63 2 percent the labor force participation rate has tracked at roughly the same level for the past four months it shows you there s a quite a bit of dynamism in the u s labor market samana said job seekers need to take advantage of it there s definitely pockets of growth and there s going to be pockets of decline said irina novoselsky ceo at careerbuilder com the supply and demand trends are very different in different zip codes she said those uneven rates of job growth could be holding back wage gains at an annualized 3 1 percent wage growth is still slightly below what many economists would consider a healthy range of 3 5 to 4 percent although market observers said the persistently low rate of inflation helps mitigate that it s faster than the rate of inflation greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com said of the wage growth rate we are seeing some growth in consumer buying power albeit modest he said if you look at the six month average you can see that there s been a continued deceleration in payrolls growth especially in manufacturing there s been a clear deceleration in wage growth samana said although he added that this trend does have a silver lining for companies when you start to meaningfully accelerate north of 3 percent that s when profit margins come under pressure he said market experts worried that a looming tranche of tariffs on 156 billion in chinese made consumer goods could drive up corporate expenses in unpredictable ways and more importantly hurt consumer buying power those tariffs are much more geared towards the u s consumer and if the u s consumer were to start to feel their costs rise meaningfully most people don t have a lot of excess savings samana said the consumer spends until they start to worry about their financial situation when combined with the cost pressures of tariffs a tight labor market could create inflation more quickly than demand for workers alone we re pretty concerned about the overall impact on inflation said john bredemus chief investment officer at allianz investment management higher inflation could drive up mortgage rates and contribute to a rising dollar a headwind for u s multinational firms for this reason some economists were less sanguine about the longer term outlook in spite of november s outsized job gains questioning whether the positive reading was too good to be true it seems like a candidate for a big downward revision said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics who characterized the report as an outlier in a client note a repeat of this performance in december would be a different story but we think downside correction is more likely he said economists said that while the effects of new tariffs wouldn t be immediate they would be hard to mitigate once set into play that does bear watching as we move into 2020 any tariffs that take effect and particularly those that hit the consumer pocketbook do pose a stiffer headwind mcbride said with consumer spending the key driver of today s economy in the face of anemic corporate investment anything that makes americans less willing or able to buy goods and services could spread the trade war s impact far beyond the manufacturing sector i think the concern is that as the dec 15 tariffs roll around if we don t have a trade agreement in place by then there is the potential that the trade war spills over into other sectors zhao said

ever had that sinking feeling you re in over your head that you ll never be able to get on top of that mountain of debt and what about interest rates how on earth would we cope if they ever returned to anything like normal the good news at least for those mortgaged to the hilt is that rates are likely to stay extremely low for a very long time we re talking years perhaps even a decade maybe even longer the reason is that hiking rates would cause way too much pain and possibly trigger a recession even worse than the crisis that shook western capitalism to its core a decade ago that s because central banks globally have boxed themselves into a corner they literally have nowhere to go they ve encouraged so many individuals corporations and governments to borrow so much by slashing interest rates to their lowest level in 5 000 years that any future rate hikes potentially could cause enormous damage here at home it s all about housing real estate now drives our domestic economy and rather than attempting to cool a runaway market the reserve bank once again is fuelling another boom in fact in the absence of further help from the federal government it has thrown caution to the wind and is banking on housing as its main weapon to keep our sputtering economy from stalling two years ago our monetary mandarins were fretting about a housing bubble blowing up the economy and successfully engineered a gradual deflation but as housing prices went south households stopped spending and the residential construction boom ground to a halt threatening to push unemployment higher even worse the price declines left thousands of households carrying more debt than the value of their property particularly in western australia that posed a serious risk to the banking system given our housing debt has trebled over the past 15 years to around 1 8 trillion central banks have encouraged individuals corporations and governments to borrow to an extent that any future rate hikes potentially could cause enormous damage supplied australian bureau of statistics the end result borrowing restrictions were relaxed and the rba since has cut rates three times with another due as early as february it s now hoping that higher house prices will make consumers feel wealthier and start spending again there s just one hitch housing prices again have surged in sydney and melbourne and if the recent blistering pace is maintained will be back at bubble levels early next year how wall street ate itself we re not alone in this cast your mind back to this time last year global stock markets led by wall street were in turmoil and a mild panic had begun to creep in the parallels with our housing market are uncanny the us federal reserve having narrowly avoided economic catastrophe in 2008 by cutting rates to zero and implementing three massive rounds of money printing figured it was time to unwind the stimulus between late 2016 and the end of last year it hiked rates eight times pushing them to 2 5 per cent most ordinary americans were unfazed by the gradual hikes unemployment was low and the economy seemed to be on the mend midway through last year however wall street caught a case of the yips investors hit the sell button as fears took hold that american companies wouldn t cope debt was to blame for the past decade corporate america has been on a borrowing binge us corporate debt now stands at an eye watering us10 trillion 14 6 trillion the problem is instead of tipping the cash into productivity enhancing investments corporate america ploughed most of that debt into buying their own shares that s correct their own shares last year alone american companies spent us1 trillion buying their own stock in fact share buybacks as they are called have been the bedrock of wall street demand in recent years why on earth would any chief executive do this first it s an easy and tax effective way to distribute cash back to shareholders but the real reasons are that the extra demand for stock boosts the share price and because there are fewer shares on issue it creates the illusion that earnings per share are rising it just so happens that most executive bonuses are based on rising share prices and earnings per share bingo this graph from investment bank morgan stanley highlights the folly of what has been occurring in the us once you add in dividends american companies have been paying out more than 100 per cent of their earnings to shareholders that s not sustainable as investors discovered in 2001 during the dotcom bust and 2008 as the gfc took hold american companies have been paying out more than 100 per cent of their earnings to shareholders supplied morgan stanley when interest rates are close to zero when the cash you re borrowing essentially is free those running the show look like geniuses but when interest rates start to rise that debt needs to be serviced that s why wall street began to tank late last year corporate america couldn t afford the higher interest payments because it had been borrowing cash just to pass on to shareholders all that debt and nothing to show for it under pressure from a furious president donald trump the us federal reserve reversed course and cut rates twice low interest rates were supposed to boost business investment instead they ve artificially inflated wall street and now the federal reserve is too scared to push rates any higher for fear of sparking a market crash as fed chief jerome powell noted in may could the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than currently appreciated my colleagues and i continually ask ourselves that question wall street punched through new records a fortnight ago as the longest bull run in american history continues role reversal once upon a time financial markets reacted to government and central bank policy now it s the reverse markets are driving policy once upon a time financial markets reflected or tried to anticipate what was happening in the real economy now they re leading it just as debt can turbocharge returns in a bull market it can magnify losses in a downturn and with so much outstanding debt with corporates and households so leveraged a rise in interest rates could undermine markets threatening consumption and growth that s what has trapped central banks they ve gone to the extreme end of monetary policy they ve encouraged a huge uptake in debt and they ve pushed asset prices into the stratosphere widening the gulf between those who have assets and those who don t it has distorted resource allocation and encouraged investors to take on far more risk than they d ordinarily be comfortable with just to get a return it has been hugely successful in staving off market collapses but for how long maybe years no one knows how to unwind this no one can afford to have it unwind the pain would be too much to bear
cnn sen elizabeth warren has big plans for america if she s elected president the massachusetts senator would provide free health care for everyone she would wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions of people and give free child care to millions of kids she would increase social security benefits by 200 a month and invest heavily in clean energy technology these big ideas along with others the 2020 democratic candidate has announced come with an equally big price tag more than 30 trillion over 10 years if enacted her proposals would balloon federal spending by more than 50 over a decade on top of the nearly 58 trillion already projected by the congressional budget office to pay for it warren would increase taxes on the wealthy corporations and wall street while expecting employers and states to chip in too she s got a very very ambitious you might almost call it a muscular program of what government should do said william gale senior fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution it s firmly based on the idea that some problems lend themselves to government solutions better than others do it s a no apologies approach to policy warren and her 2020 democratic rival sen bernie sanders are proposing a major expansion of government involvement in americans lives as a way to boost the middle and working classes they stand in contrast to former vice president joe biden and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg whose plans call for a more moderate broadening of federal spending in addition to her spending proposals warren also wants to wield the government s power to help consumers and smaller businesses her accountable capitalism plan would require very large corporations to consider the interests of all stakeholders not just shareholders and she would mandate that workers at big companies elect no less than 40 of board members warren also wants to use federal power to break up large industries such as big tech and big ag and increase oversight on wall street it s not about big government or small government said bharat ramamurti the campaign s deputy policy director for economic policy it s about who government works for warren s vision harkens back to the major social programs of earlier eras president franklin d roosevelt launched a series of federal initiatives known as the new deal in the 1930s to stabilize the nation and help it recover from the great depression some efforts such as the works progress administration which provided jobs for the unemployed were short term but others including social security unemployment insurance and federal agricultural subsidies still exist roughly three decades after the new deal president lyndon b johnson spearheaded the great society which wove the government even deeper into the nation s social fabric it created medicare and medicaid as well as head start and other anti poverty environmental and consumer protection initiatives warren continues in this tradition taking the view that government involvement can be beneficial said julian zelizer history professor at princeton university and cnn contributor what s more he said one of her central issues is that america s free market philosophy has left the middle class struggling which is why government needs to step in to provide crucial services she wants to make the argument that s why we need a different path right now zelizer said the largest of warren s proposals is her medicare for all plan which would create a national health insurance system that would cover everyone at no cost but it would increase federal spending by 20 5 trillion over a decade which she plans to cover mainly by requiring contributions from employers and by raising taxes on the wealthy corporations and wall street she says she d aim to implement the program the brainchild of sanders by the end of her first term warren also wants to invest 2 trillion in researching developing and manufacturing clean energy technology to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 warren would spend another 1 trillion on additional protections for workers and transitioning american infrastructure and industry away from fossil fuels she would beef up social security benefits at a cost of 3 1 trillion and provide free or subsidized universal child care which comes with a 1 trillion price tag and warren would make all public colleges tuition free while eliminating the student loan debt of tens of millions of americans she also wants to invest in k 12 education and affordable housing warren maintains all this additional spending would be covered by taxes and would greatly boost economic growth by helping millions of middle class americans but some budget watchers are worried that her plans do not include reining in the nation s debt the us budget deficit soared to nearly 1 trillion for the 2019 fiscal year the treasury department reported last month largely due to the 2017 republican backed tax cuts you still after doing all this haven t addressed the fundamental problem that is the long term fiscal unsustainability of our current policies said g william hoagland senior vice president of the bipartisan policy center a think tank
what plans does china have for its cbdc when mark zuckerberg stood in front of a predatory us congress to defend libra he warned that china was not idly waiting around when it comes to developing its own revolutionary tech his words seemed to trigger a switch almost immediately afterwards president xi jinping came out in support of blockchain technology he also said that plans for china s cbdc central bank digital currency would be accelerated but it wasn t a rapid or spontaneous response to libra china has been researching the possibility of a digital rmb since 2014 advertisement advertisement gavin brown senior lecturer and associate professor of economics policy and international business at manchester metropolitan university told coin rivet i was surprised and enthused that they had actually been researching it for the last five years it wasn t a knee jerk reaction it s something they ve been monitoring closely for some time and they deem it to have credibility so that for me straight away was interesting but what could china s cbdc be used for and what are the motives behind it china s cbdc could facilitate global trade slow and cumbersome bank transfers red tape exchange rates and existing payment rails currently slow down global trade then there s also the fact that the us dollar is currently the lead currency almost 50 of all international trade is conducted in dollars advertisement advertisement for countries hampered by us sanctions such as venezuela this pretty much cuts them off from the global economy christian oertel global marketing manager at chinese blockchain protocol conflux chain told coin rivet on a bigger picture it seems like another step towards dethroning wall street as the financial centre and the usd as the leading currency story continues brown agreed adding there is also the problem of dollarisation of oil oil is quoted in usd so china s cbdc could be used as another front of attack in the international and global currency wars the south china morning post recently reported that venezuela was considering paying chinese oil suppliers and contractors in yuan accounts in china as caracas looks for ways to survive without access to the us financial system paying suppliers in yuan would allow venezuela to use funds that it currently has available in china without touching the us financial system however there s still the complex and lengthy process of opening chinese bank accounts and transferring the money imagine how many roadblocks a digital yuan could overcome speeding up international transfers bobby lee co founder of the first chinese exchange btcc and founder of the ballet hardware cryptocurrency wallet told coin rivet china will control the ledger and it will be a digital rmb it will make the movement of the rmb much easier advertisement advertisement today the only way for me to give you money is to give you paper cash if i want to do a bank transfer i have to rely on third party entities business hours time zones and so on then there s the question of whether you have a bank account in china all these complex issues if there is a digital rmb i can send you digital rmb and i can send it to you right away oertel added it will surely speed up international transfers and bring the rmb to a pole position as leading currency within the belt and road initiative by being a pioneer in digitalising the national currency china s best practice can be adapted to other national currencies which would not only support the adapting governments transition into becoming cashless but also simplify their process of international transfers with the rmb as a leading currency a cbdc could be used to control its population brown believes that there are several ways that china s cbdc could be used facilitating international trade and transactions is just one advertisement advertisement the second part of the agenda is using it as an instrument of control internally for their own population after all permissionless currencies and corporate currencies present quite a threat to a country like china china has a billion and a half people and is at risk of being invaded by bitcoin that could wreak havoc in a country of such a scale brown remarked the ability to have similar technology in terms of speed and transparency but to do so in a state controlled manner is an extremely powerful tool as oertel points out china is already gaining the reputation of being a cashless society however becoming cashless also means relying on third party systems like alipay when it comes to payments or transfers advertisement advertisement a clear audit of the money trail is not necessarily provided or absolutely trustworthy in contrast when the digital currency is based on blockchain technology tracing the flow of money can be done without relying on audits of third party systems we often hear about the anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies however in many cases their transparent ledgers make them exactly the opposite i know everyone talks about the anonymity of cryptocurrency says brown but it s an auditor s dream you have an audit trail for every transaction that s ever happened in the history of the coin if it s done properly obviously bitcoin is pseudo anonymous and currencies like monero are completely cryptographically dark but a central bank digital currency has complete transparency on everything an alternative global monetary system like lee brown also points to the fact that the ease of use of a digital currency could greatly facilitate payments globally advertisement advertisement if you can come along to people with a mobile phone and internet connection and ask them if they want to use a digital currency backed by the second largest economy in the world many people would be interested in that this would clearly have repercussions such as undermining the currency of the nation states whose populations decide to move towards that however the future of currency is clearly digital whether it s led by governments or corporations it s not only china who s moving forward with plans of issuing a cbdc the bank of international settlements carried out a survey of 80 central banks across the world regarding their opinions on digital currency it found that almost three quarters of them were either actively researching cbdcs or undergoing feasibility tests the bank of england has also released papers on how a crypto pound would work in the uk economy advertisement advertisement brown adds if you re the central bank of a meaningful economy or nation state and a digital currency comes along as a direct threat it s in your interests to at least put together a research team to see how you might react to it what will the us s response be to china s cbdc while china appears to be steaming ahead the us may be dithering however it may be that the response doesn t come in the form of a fedcoin or a us central bank digital dollar i don t see the fed agreeing to tokenise the dollar and going toe to toe with the chinese brown remarks we may see a tech company like facebook flying the american flag instead of the government or a central bank advertisement advertisement corporations like facebook certainly have the reach half the world s population is on facebook whatsapp or instagram it seems clear that the response may not come from the fed in the us says brown it may come from a corporate so we may have a technological giant like facebook going up against a governmental giant in the form of the people s republic of china or the people s bank of china he continues my expectation for the future is not in the likes of bitcoin or permissionless currencies all of our direct spending happens with multinationals i think this is going to be a competition between corporate and nation states as more and more corporations launch their own currencies advertisement advertisement i see this as the next phase of globalisation corporates are so big now if facebook were a country it would be 60th in the world in terms of gdp this is going to be a regulated contest between nation states trying to retain monetary policy control and corporates trying to get in on the act it all sounds a little like the war of the worlds will the future of money actually be in the best interests of the end users or are we willingly handing over more control to governments and corporations only time will tell the post what plans does china have for its cbdc appeared first on coin rivet

by olga cotaga london reuters the unwillingness of the top four u s banks to lend cash combined with a burst of demand from hedge funds for secured funding could explain a recent spike in u s money market rates the bank for international settlements said cash available to banks for short term funding all but dried up in late september and interest rates deep in the plumbing of u s financial markets climbed into double digits that forced the fed to make an emergency injection of billions of dollars for the first time since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago while the exact cause of the squeeze is unclear with explanations ranging from large withdrawals for quarterly tax payments to a big settlement of a trade in u s treasuries bis analysts said the growing reliance on the biggest u s banks to keep the repo market functioning may have been a big factor the big four banks which bis did not name in its report have become net providers of funds to repo markets as they account for more than half of all treasuries held by banks in the united states at the federal reserve the repo market underpins much of the u s financial system helping ensure banks have liquidity to meet their daily operational needs in a repo trade wall street firms and banks offer u s treasuries and other high quality securities as collateral to raise cash often just overnight to finance their trading and lending the next day borrowers repay the loans plus what is typically a nominal rate of interest and get their bonds back in other words they repurchase or repo the bonds the system typically hums along with the interest rate charged on repo deals hovering close to the fed s benchmark overnight rate which it cut on wednesday to 1 75 2 00 from 2 00 2 25 but in late september interest rates shot up to as high as 10 for some overnight loans more than four times the fed s policy rate raising concerns about the fragility of u s dollar funding markets graphic u s banks atrophy after the u s federal reserve began to run down its 4 trillion plus balance sheet from october 2017 banks cash reserves at the fed also contracted while their holdings of u s treasuries grew rapidly the bis said that reduction in cash holdings at the fed sped up after the u s debt ceiling was suspended in early august the treasury drained more than 120 billion of reserves from aug 14 to sept 17 reducing the cash buffers of the big four banks and hence their willingness to lend in the repo market the bis found the repo rate rose to an intraday high of about 700 basis points with some trades reportedly occurring at up to 10 the dislocations suggest that central banks post crisis unconventional operations have left a profound imprint on market functioning said claudio borio head of the monetary and economic department at bis banks get used to a protracted period of abundant excess reserves withdrawing them may result in unpredictable and sudden market adjustments it is as if a muscle had atrophied he said that rush for short dated secured funding was exacerbated by hedge funds who had ramped up their treasury repos to fund arbitrage trades between cash bonds and derivatives the bis also noted that the spike in the repo rate spilled over into the currency derivatives market on which banks rely increasingly for short term funding in the past three years fx swap volumes have grown to make up as much as 49 of the overall foreign exchange market due to the growing participation of lower tier banks which depend on swaps for funding as they lack direct access to u s dollar markets repo markets alongside the fx swap market for u s dollar funding may again find themselves in the eye of the storm should financial stress arise at some point borio said the surge in fx short dated swap trading underlines this risk
it s not neo liberalism that s to blame it s capitalism in marx s day the doctrine that the government should not interfere in the operation of the capitalist economy was known as manchesterism after the city in the north of england where capitalist industry was then most developed and whose capitalists wanted to be free to pursue profits as they thought fit its advocates preached free trade the abolition of tariffs on imported goods and bounties on exported goods and letting market forces operate freely they even opposed laws against adulteration and to limit the hours of work of those they employed also known as economic liberalism it had roots in the eighteenth century in french manufacturers and merchants who told the royal bureaucracy to leave them alone and let them get on with their business laissez faire and in adam smith s curious theory that behind market forces was some invisible hand ensuring that these operated for the common good however a practical problem soon arose over industries and services which all capitalist businesses had to make use of such as transport roads canals railways and communications post telegraph capitalists did not want these to be in the hands of any one group of their number who would thereby be in a position to hold the rest of them to ransom and charge monopoly prices this was why in britain as early as 1844 a railways act contained a clause providing if need be for state ownership so called nationalisation in europe railways had been in the hands of the state almost from the beginning because of their strategic importance for transporting troops in times of war in the event britain settled for price regulation by the government which was also a violation of laissez faire economic liberalism never caught on in its entirety outside britain as free trade was seen not without justification by rival capitalists in other countries as a means of giving british capitalists a competitive advantage they demanded that their governments protect them from such competition through tariffs on imported british goods beyond that however they embraced the doctrine that governments should not interfere with their pursuit of profits enter keynes between the two world wars of the last century even britain abandoned free trade and the gold standard an era of government created fiat money opened up in which governments had to pursue an interventionist policy to manage their currency with the financial crash of 1929 and the big slump in production that followed governments also came under pressure to intervene in the capitalist economy to try to get it expanding again public works programmes were initiated such as roosevelt s new deal in the usa and hitler s rearmament in germany in his 1936 general theory of employment interest and income the british economist john maynard keynes provided a theoretical justification for such ad hoc schemes he argued that left to itself laissez faire capitalism would not necessarily recover from a slump of its own accord as economists had preached till then but that government intervention in the form of a tax policy to stimulate demand was required in the event of a boom this could be prevented from ending in a slump as booms had previously always done by the government pursing the opposite policy of using taxes to discourage consumption thanks to government intervention steady capitalist expansion could be engineered naturally this theory especially stimulating demand in a slump by redistributing purchasing power from the rich to the non rich was acclaimed by reformists as a justification for the reforms they already favoured those that had still regarded themselves as in the marxist tradition abandoned marx for keynes keynesianism was not consciously pursued as a government policy till the beginning of the second world war when that war was not followed by a slump as the end of the first world war had been but by a 25 year period of capitalist expansion with only minor recessions many open supporters of capitalism hailed keynes for having saved capitalism but this was an illusion put to the test when the post war boom came to an end in the 1970s keynesian policies resulted in what was called stagflation a rise in the general price level while the economy remained stagnant the post war boom had been caused by other factors such as reconstruction and the spontaneous expansion of internal and world markets exit keynes keynes v friedman the end of the post war boom led to what was called a fiscal crisis of the capitalist state governments depend for what they spend on levying taxes which ultimately fall on capitalist profits and on borrowing money from those who have it with less profit being made there was less to tax and less to borrow government had no alternative but to cut their spending rather than increasing it as keynes had advocated they should do to get out of a slump another economic theory was required to replace keynesianism and justify this the new theory popularised by the american economist milton friedman called itself monetarism as it advocated a tight monetary policy i e cutting government spending and letting market forces revive the capitalist economy by restoring profitability of its own accord as asset prices and real wages fell this was not really a new theory but a revival of pre keynesian economic liberalism there is some justification then for calling this replacement policy neo liberalism what is not justified is seeing its application as a free choice on the part the part of governments it was something imposed on them by the workings of the capitalist economy given the situation it was in governments had no choice but to apply it in other words capitalism was the cause with neo liberalism merely the political and ideological justification what the capitalist conditions imposed was that governments should cut their spending or rather cut taxing profits with the result that they had less to spend with less to spend austerity was the order of the day in all countries irrespective of the political colour of their government it was not just reagan and thatcher in the usa and britain but also mitterrand in france public services were cut back welfare and benefits were slashed especially for those who for one reason or another were not able to find a job since the economists preached that there was a so called natural rate of unemployment which could be as high as 6 percent millions of already poor people had their standard of living reduced even further other reforms enacted during the post war boom were whittled away or rolled back to reduce their borrowing governments sold off state assets to private capitalist firms who were granted the right to make profits from them in return for themselves raising the capital to finance them as a policy of trying to ensure steady sustained capitalist development neo liberalism has been just as much a failure as keynesianism was as spectacularly shown by the crash of 2008 and the great recession that followed what this showed is that no matter what policy governments adopt capitalism goes relentlessly on its way repeatedly going through the boom slump cycle that it has done since the 1820s the fact is that governments do not cannot control the way the capitalist economy works it is the other way round it is the operation of capitalism that constrains what governments do all they can do is little more than react to what capitalism throws at them there is a sense in which they do have a choice they could choose to try to defy what capitalism s economic forces dictate but if they do they will make matters worse as marx pointed out with regard to banking legislation while governments cannot make things better they can make things worse ignorant and confused banking laws such as those of 1844 5 may intensify the monetary crisis but no bank legislation can abolish crises themselves capital volume 3 chapter 30 penguin books edition p 621 this warning is apt because left wing populists are calling for neo liberalism to be replaced by government intervention to spend money to end austerity and get capitalism expanding again a revival of keynes s discredited idea that could be called neo keynesianism as marxists know both from the past experience of such attempts and from a knowledge of how capitalism works this is doomed to fail and would make things worse it is not neo liberalism that is the problem but capitalism it is not a change of policy that is required but a change of socio economic system adam buick from socialist standard december 2019 article

just when emmanuel macron seemed to have finally put the gilets jaunes yellow vest protests behind him the country finds itself in the throes of one of the biggest strikes seen in years and when it comes to such protests the french are not known for doing things by halves in all an estimated 800 000 people over the past few days have taken part in demonstrations around the country 65 000 of them in the capital paris according to government figures the eiffel tower and other businesses in the city closed down and security authorities formed a barricade around the presidential palace authorities also deployed more than 6000 police officers to control protests and marches across the country schools were shut flights cancelled and transport systems disrupted and this may only just be the start the fresh round of social unrest is once again calling into question macron s top down government style which was a major factor in last year s protests over poor wages and dwindling living standards the current strike pits macron a 41 year old former investment banker who came to power in 2017 on a promise to open up france s highly regulated economy against a trade union movement that says he is set on dismantling workers rights and protections no one can fail to see the clouds of social grievance that have gathered over france observed alexis moreau a journalist and french labour movement researcher writing about the crisis in the political magazine tribune a few days ago brought to power by an electoral bloc mostly consisting of top managers company bosses and well off pensioners emmanuel macron has pursued a neo liberal agenda that has deepened the divides in french society moreau added many french citizens agree and sympathy for the strike has been fuelled by frustration over macron s wider economic record critics of the president for example point to the fact that while he continues to chip away at the welfare state and slashes unemployment benefits france s rich get off lightly this after all they argue is a country with more than 40 billionaires and where french companies last year paid out more dividends to shareholders than anywhere else in continental europe for his part macron following what some say was a political victory in neutering last year s protests promised to adopt a more inclusive approach he would listen to other voices he said and take stock of their grievances but evidence of that to date say detractors remains scant the victory doesn t seem to have rehabilitated macron this week s protest is the reflection of a crisis in french society one that can explode at any moment said jean garrigues a political historian at the university of orleans speaking to the new york times there s real anxiety over the future garrigues warned at the core of the current unease causing unrest across france is what macron refers to as his big bang overhaul of the country s near sacred pension scheme which comprises more than 40 different plans many with different retirement ages and benefits in theory everyone in france retires at 62 in reality however the average real retirement age is 63 but that number masks a host of disparities the average age for men is just over 60 but some people mostly women with fragmented careers have to work until they are 67 but some pension schemes especially for certain state employees de facto subsidised by other workers are exceptionally generous train drivers mariners and paris opera house ballet dancers for instance are able to retire at the age of 52 up to a decade earlier than the average worker at the moment french retirees receive average state pensions of 61 of their final earnings according to 2018 organisation for economic co operation and development oecd statistics this is less than italy 93 2 but far more than the uk 29 given such complexities in france however past attempts at pension reforms have ended badly former president jacques chirac s conservative government in 1995 caved into union demands after weeks of crippling protests and lost a parliamentary election 18 months later the question now is whether macron can weather the current political storm or will he suffer the same fate as chirac underlining how serious the crisis is for the president the french daily le monde on thursday called it the moment of truth for macron not pulling any punches the newspaper insisted that the next few days are a decisive test for the head of state according to macron the existing pension system is unfair and too costly he wants a single points based system under which for each euro contributed every pensioner has equal rights or so the thinking goes the accumulation of these points throughout a person s working life would then be translated into a monthly salary at the point they retired supporters of macron s reforms say the points based pensions system has a number of advantages first it gives individuals a great deal of autonomy they can choose if they want to retire at 58 or 80 second it offers obvious incentives someone who retires at 65 will get a better pension than someone on the same salary that decides to stop working aged 60 the scheme s simplicity equality of treatment and above all transferability these supporters say makes it an attractive proposition but others are far less convinced according to moreau currently pension levels for those in the private sector are set on the basis of a worker s 25 best years or in the case of state employees the last six months of their career but under macron s reform proposals their salary would now instead be calculated on the basis of their entire active period you don t have to be a rocket scientist to work out that most wage earners would lose out from this starting with those whose working lives were hit by periods of unemployment says moreau adding that around france working people have been getting out their calculators to work out how much they re set to lose other observers agree that there are serious built in discrepancies veteran journalist john lichfield who was paris correspondent for the independent for 20 years says there will inevitably be many losers as well as gainers from the macron scheme nurses for example have already pointed out that their pension regime has a 3 billion surplus while the lawyers fund is 2bn in the black wrote lichfield in the online current affairs magazine politico other funds such as those for metro workers are chronically loss making teachers poorly paid early in their careers say that they would lose out if their pensions were decided by lifetime points rather than final salary lichfield added some critics also point to flaws in the execution of macron s reforms suggesting he has left it too late in his presidential term to undertake such substantial changes it s a narrow window of opportunity they say to push through such reforms after which leaders like macron no longer have enough political capital to expend on changes that risk losing public support this certainly appears to be the case right now in france where the political storm clouds continue to gather menacingly over the elysee palace yet the unpopularity in some quarters with macron s pension reforms sits in sharp contrast with some opinion poll ratings which are said to have climbed to the high 30s and low 40s unusually high for a french mid term president but as the crisis rumbles on macron s pension tsar jean paul delevoye is due to hold talks with the unions on monday before the prime minister edouard philippe presents the broad outlines of the proposal to the public midweek last friday however french union leaders said public workers in opposition to the reforms should maintain their industrial action until tuesday when they urged members to again flood the streets unions will meet on tuesday evening to decide on our next actions if by then macron and philippe have not reversed course and opened negotiations catherine perret of the left wing cgt union told reporters the current strikes are being seen as a test of strength for the french trade union movement which has been more defensive since the 2008 economic crisis for those hard left unions whose membership and influence have diminished in recent years the crisis poses a delicate tightrope walk of needing to pressure macron and the government while not creating a public backlash in paris last thursday gilets jaunes protesters who posed a significant challenge to macron s agenda with anti government demonstrations last year joined union marchers but thursday s march was also much larger than any yellow vest protest underlining the threat level and unease among wider sections of french workers and society the government is truly afraid of the scale of the mobilisation bertrand hammache a cgt union official at the ratp paris s bus and metro service was quoted as saying last thursday it has begun bilateral meetings with each union to try and reassure us over what the reform means and give us a reason to give up on the strike but that s out of the question hammache insisted but not all unions agree france s biggest and most moderate trade union federation the cfdt for example broadly supports macron s reforms while some unions have failed to agree on a common front against them by far the biggest fear for the moment though is the potential for violent protests stirred up by members of groups from the hard right and left of the political spectrum in central paris last thursday police used tear gas when hooded protesters on the fringes of the trade unions march threw fireworks at officers ransacked bus stops and set fire to rubbish bins french interior minister christophe castaner has warned that thousands of anarchist black bloc and hardcore yellow vest protesters who last year took to the streets for months over the cost of living and perceived elitism of the political class might try to wreak havoc some observers however have also previously expressed concern that far from being confined to macron and france itself the crisis poses a much wider danger writing in her column in the guardian last year french journalist natalie nougayrede suggested that extreme forces across europe were busily rejoicing over macron s gilets jaunes predicament according to nougayrede s assessment from britain s hardline brexiteers to italy s far right strongman matteo salvini not to mention putin s propaganda outlets the relish is unmistakable certainly there is little doubt that macron s championing of liberals and pro europeans has not gone down well with some of those leaders he has criticised for targeting migrants and political opponents perhaps sensing macron s vulnerability at this precise moment some have been quick to exploit his difficulties at home in france on a similar tack there are pressing questions too as to how much the current strike could damage macron s wider international standing it s worth remembering that just as things were brewing up at home other leaders put macron on the spot last week during the nato summit in london where he clashed with us president donald trump during a tense press conference but without doubt it s on his home turf that macron faces his toughest battle for now should he not blink over his controversial pension policy then doubtless the gas masks and barricades will again be the norm on the streets of paris this week back in 1950 while serving as prime minster of france edgar faure once wryly observed that france is always early to revolt because it is always late to reform pension reform is never an easy political sell not least in france and might yet well prove a make or break moment for macron on many levels france s winter of discontent might just be beginning

back before the launch of the iphone technology visionary marc andreessen was having dinner in palo alto with steve jobs jobs showed andreessen a still not for sale iphone and the netscape founder suggested that its touch keyboard might turn off consumers used to the button style keyboards featured on the wildly popular blackberry communication devices about this it should be remembered that the expectation back in 2007 was that the iphone would be a niche product at best amid blackberry s ongoing market leadership as readers can probably imagine jobs dismissed andreessen s suggestion that customers wanted what blackberry was selling he had a better idea for consumers and it turns out jobs was right fast forward to the present and apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world largely thanks to the iphone with a market capitalization that exceeds 1 trillion investors presently value once dominant blackberry at 3 billion so while efforts on the part of corporations to understand their customers are as old as corporations are and very pro customer as evidenced by what we want and need from retailers routinely being in stock there are limits to the old saying know your customer it is in many ways overrated for one it s arguably more important for a business or business ceo to know himself he must believe deeply in where he s going in terms of products an obvious example here would once again be jobs can anyone imagine him selling microsoft or dell products would he have been as charismatic on the stage selling what he plainly saw as sub standard a case can similarly be made that the most successful ceos will not be the ones who know their customers best but who know their own employees best particularly the employees in sales crucial when it comes to selling is belief level in the product being sold strong belief will unearth in the seller a powerful desire to learn the product and in the process greater skill when it comes to showing the potential buyer why it s useful apple stores are instructive here it s apparent the people on the floor are there and full of energy because the engineers and designers in cupertino made products for them after that simply expressing a desire to know your customer is the path toward the stationary state and eventual obsolescence think about it were customers demanding online shopping before amazon or transportation at the tap of a button before uber or dvds by mail before netflix pre netflix the vastly overrated know your customer approach amounted to now defunct blockbuster video hollywood video and movie gallery figuring out the best way to meet the needs of movie lovers who would literally get in the car and go to a physical location to search for movies to watch many of them frequently out of stock know your customer is all about rushing the present into the future it s primitive stuff in dynamic societies the future is hard to predict precisely because so many brilliant minds are trying to teach consumers about what they want as opposed to knowing what they want readers obsessed with china s alleged theft of our intellectual property would be wise to keep this in mind what s valuable now is rarely a predictor of what s going to be valuable in the future but s that s a digression this write up is meant to focus on tesla ceo elon musk in a recent tweet about the automaker s upcoming cybertruck musk observed that nobody expects the cybertruck brilliant so good it s a reminder that the perpetual entrepreneur in musk was wholly prepared for the criticism of what by all appearances will be a very different kind of truck musk is no imitator not even close he s an entrepreneur entrepreneurs do things that no one expects and that most think kind of ridiculous while nobody expected musk s vision for truck of the future musk plainly expected the criticism that came his way thank goodness for people like him as opposed to knowing their customers entrepreneurs like musk lead them will he be correct it s very hard to say odds are no and presumably not for reasons as simple as the cybertruck looking so different odds are musk will be wrong simply because entrepreneurs generally are bill gates has acknowledged that the vast majority of his experiments failed so has jeff bezos and so did jobs drill all too many dry holes these are people who chose and choose to lead as opposed to maintaining the status quo musk adds that i do zero market research whatsoever rather than trying to provide us the present in the present musk aims to rush the future into the present it s people like him who make the world go round to which self proclaimed free market purists will howl in response that elon musk is a crony capitalist don t you get it tesla only exists because government subsidies prop it up you claim to be for free markets what s wrong with you musk is in bed with government and fleecing the taxpayers with a 7 500 per car sweetheart deal you ve gone soft about federal subsidies it s surely too bad they exist there s nothing about economic growth or business or electric cars in the constitution so in an ideal world these handouts quite simply wouldn t be in a sane world the federal government would be very small would spend and do so little that no businessman would see fit to spend any time lobbying in washington all true stuff in modern times democrats and republicans have turned the founders vision on its head by arrogating to themselves so much power that they ve done so is shameful but also expected national politicians want life s comforts too and they re only able to attain them insofar as the federal government is very active when it comes to spending subsidies regulation and tax carve outs and making life quite a bit more complicated overall call the latter a retirement plan for politicians their reverential treatment while in office and their high pay once out of office is a consequence of the complication but don t presume that things like 7 500 buyer credits for electric cars prop up the musks of the world as evidenced by the rich demographic that presently owns teslas it s aggressively naïve to presume that a 7 500 credit informs their buying decisions after which it should be pointed out that the credit only counts toward the first 200 000 or 300 000 teslas sold this matters a great deal to the debate about musk when it s remembered that stock prices are the market s expectation of all the dollars a company will earn in the future looked at in terms of tesla it has a 60 billion dollar valuation this is something for all of you purists to think long and hard about when you trash musk you reveal how little you understand markets simply because the 60 billion valuation logically has exceedingly little to do with a tax credit on a few hundred thousand cars sold and most everything to do with investor expectation that tesla hasn t scratched the surface of its ability to lead its customers to a different and plainly very exciting transportation future at 60 billion the market expectation is that tesla and musk won t meet consumer needs as much they ll shape them exciting indeed how fun to see where all of this goes tesla is priced for an ability to transform the future by virtue of rushing an unexpected future into the present thank goodness for people like elon musk

just when emmanuel macron seemed to have finally put the gilets jaunes yellow vest protests behind him the country finds itself in the throes of one of the biggest strikes seen in years and when it comes to such protests the french are not known for doing things by halves in all an estimated 800 000 people over the past few days have taken part in demonstrations around the country 65 000 of them in the capital paris according to a union organiser read more david pratt on france s desert war the eiffel tower and other businesses in the city closed down and security authorities formed a barricade around the presidential palace authorities also deployed over 6 000 police officers to control protests and marches across the country schools were shut flights cancelled and transport systems disrupted and this may only just be the start the fresh round of social unrest is once again calling into question macron s top down government style which was a major factor in last year s protest over poor wages and dwindling living standards the current strike pits macron a 41 year old former investment banker who came to power in 2017 on a promise to open up france s highly regulated economy against a trade union movement that say he is set on dismantling workers rights and protections no one can fail to see the clouds of social grievance that have gathered over france observed alexis moreau a journalist and french labour movement researcher writing about the crisis in the political magazine tribune a few days ago brought to power by an electoral bloc mostly consisting of top managers company bosses and well off pensioners emmanuel macron has pursued a neoliberal agenda that has deepened the divides in french society moreau added many french citizens agree and sympathy for the strike has been fuelled by frustration over macron s wider economic record critics of the president for example point to the fact that while he continues to chip away at the welfare state and slashes unemployment benefits france s rich get off lightly this after all they argue is a country with more than 40 billionaires and where french companies last year paid out more dividends to shareholders than anywhere else in continental europe for his part macron following what some say was a political victory in neutering last years protests promised to adopt a more inclusive approach he would listen to other voices he said and take stock of their grievances but evidence of that to date say detractors remains scant the victory doesn t seem to have rehabilitated macron this week s protest is the reflection of a crisis in french society one that can explode at any moment said jean garrigues a political historian at the university of orleans speaking to the new york times there s real anxiety over the future garrigues warned at the core of the current unease causing unrest across france is what macron refers to as his big bang overhaul of the country s near sacred pension scheme which comprises more than 40 different plans many with different retirement ages and benefits in theory everyone in france retires at 62 in reality however the average real retirement age is 63 but that number masks a host of disparities the average age for men is just over 60 but some people mostly women with fragmented careers have to work until they are 67 but some pension schemes especially for certain state employees de facto subsidised by other workers are exceptionally generous train drivers mariners and paris opera house ballet dancers for instance are able to retire at the age of 52 up to a decade earlier than the average worker at the moment french retirees receive average state pensions of 61 per cent of their final earnings according to the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd this is less than italy 83 per cent but far more than germany 38 per cent and the uk 29 per cent given such complexities in france however past attempts at pension reforms have ended badly former president jacques chirac s conservative government in 1995 caved into union demands after weeks of crippling protests and lost a parliamentary election 18 months later read more france strikes roads blocks and railways shut the question now is whether macron can weather the current political storm or will he suffer the same fate as chirac underlining how serious the crisis is for the president the french daily le monde on thursday called it the moment of truth for macron not pulling any punches the newspaper insisted that the next few days are a decisive test for the head of state according to macron the existing pension system is unfair and too costly he wants a single points based system under which for each euro contributed every pensioner has equal rights or so the thinking goes the accumulation of these points throughout a person s working life would then be translated into a monthly salary at the point they retired supporters of macron s reforms say the points based pensions system has a number of advantages first it gives individuals a great deal of autonomy they can choose if they want to retire at 58 or 80 second it offers obvious incentives someone who retires at 65 will get a better pension than someone on the same salary that decides to stop working aged 60 the schemes simplicity equality of treatment and above all transferability say these supporters makes it an attractive proposition but others are far less convinced according to french labour movement researcher alexis moreau currently pension levels for those in the private sector are set on the basis of a worker s twenty five best years or in the case of state employees the last six months of their career but under macron s reform proposals their salary would now instead be calculated on the basis of their entire active period you don t have to be a rocket scientist to work out that most wage earners would lose out from this starting with those whose working lives were hit by periods of unemployment says moreau around france she says working people have been getting out their calculators to work out how much they re set to lose other observers agree that there are serious built in discrepancies veteran journalist john lichfield who was paris correspondent for the independent for 20 years says there will inevitably be many losers as well as gainers from the macron scheme nurses for example have already pointed out that their pension regime has a 3 billion euro surplus while the lawyers fund is 2 billion euros in the black wrote lichfield in the online current affairs magazine politico other funds such as those for metro workers are chronically loss making teachers poorly paid early in the careers say that they would lose out if their pensions were decided by lifetime points rather than final salary lichfield added some critics also point to flaws in the execution of macron s reforms suggesting he has left it too late in his presidential term to undertake such substantial changes it s a narrow window of opportunity they say to push through such reforms after which leaders like macron no longer have enough political capital to expend on changes that risk losing public support this certainly appears to be the case right now in france where the political storm clouds continue to gather menacingly over the elysee palace yet the unpopularity in some quarters with macron s pension reforms sits in sharp contrast with some opinion poll ratings which are said to have climbed to the high 30s and low 40s unusually high for a french mid term president but as the crisis rumbles on macron s pension tsar jean paul delevoye is due to hold talks with the unions on monday before the prime minister edouard philippe presents the broad outlines of the proposal to the public mid week read more emmanuel macron stands his ground saying nato suffering from brain death and needs clearer strategy last friday

have diminished in recent years the crisis poses a delicate tightrope walk of needing to pressure macron and the government while not creating a public backlash in paris last thursday gilets jaunes protesters who posed a significant challenge to macron s agenda with anti government demonstrations last year joined union marchers but thursday s march was also much larger than any yellow vest protest underlining the threat level and unease among wider sections of french workers and society the government is truly afraid of the scale of the mobilisation bertrand hammache a cgt union official at the ratp paris s bus and metro service was quoted as saying last thursday it has begun bilateral meetings with each union to try and reassure us over what the reform means and give us a reason to give up on the strike but that s out of the question hammache insisted but not all unions agree france s biggest and most moderate trade union federation the cfdt for example broadly supports macron s reforms while some unions have failed to agree on a common front against them by far the biggest fear for the moment though is the potential for violent protests stirred up by members of groups from the hard right and left of the political spectrum in central paris last thursday police used tear gas when hooded protesters on the fringes of the trade unions march threw fireworks at officers ransacked bus stops and set fire to rubbish bins french interior minister christophe castaner has warned that thousands of anarchist black bloc and hardcore yellow vest protesters who last year took to the streets for months over the cost of living and perceived elitism of the political class might try to wreak havoc some observers however have also expressed concern that far from being confined to macron and france itself the crisis poses a much wider danger writing in her column in the guardian last week french journalist natalie nougayrede suggested that extreme forces across europe are busily rejoicing over macron s gilets jaunes predicament according to nougayrede s assessment from britain s hardline brexiteers to italy s far right strongman matteoi salvini not to mention putin s propaganda outlets the relish is unmistakable certainly there is little doubt that macron s championing of liberals and pro europeans has not gone down well with some of those leaders he has criticised for targeting migrants and political opponents perhaps sensing macron s vulnerability at this precise moment some have been quick to exploit his difficulties at home in france on a similar tack there are pressing questions too as to how much the current strike could damage macron s wider international standing it s worth remembering that just as things were brewing up at home other leaders put macron on the spot last week during the nato summit in london where he clashed with us president donald trump during a tense press conference but without doubt it s on his home turf that macron faces his toughest battle for now should he not blink over his controversial pension policy then doubtless the gas masks and barricades will again be the norm on the streets of paris this week back in 1950 while serving as prime minster of france edgar faure once wryly observed that france is always early to revolt because it is always late to reform pension reform is never an easy political sell not least in france and might yet well prove a make or break moment for macron on many levels france s winter of discontent might just be beginning
port au prince the flaming barricades are mostly gone protesters have largely dissipated and traffic is once again clogging the streets of haiti s capital but hundreds of thousands of people are now suffering deep economic aftershocks after more than two months of demonstrations the protests that drew tens of thousands of people at a time to demand the resignation of president jovenel moïse also squeezed incomes shuttered businesses and disrupted the transportation of basic goods we are nearing a total crash haitian economist camille chalmers said the situation is unsustainable haiti s economy was already fragile when the new round of protests began in mid september organized by opposition leaders and supporters angry over corruption spiraling inflation and dwindling supplies including fuel more than 40 people were killed and dozens injured as protesters clashed with police moïse insisted he would not resign and called for dialogue the united nations world food program says a recent survey found that one in three haitians or 3 7 million people need urgent food assistance and 1 million are experiencing severe hunger the wfp which says it is trying to get emergency food assistance to 700 000 people blames rising prices the weakening local currency and a drop in agricultural production due partly to the disruption of recent protests in the last two years haiti s currency the gourde declined 60 percent against the dollar and inflation recently reached 20 percent chalmers said the rising cost of food is especially crucial in the country of nearly 11 million people some 60 percent make less than 2 a day and 25 percent earn less than 1 a day advertisement a 110 pound bag of rice has more than doubled in price in the local currency said marcelin saingiles a store owner who sells everything from cold drinks to cookies to used tools in port au prince the 39 year old father of three children said he now struggles to buy milk and vegetables i feed the kids but they re not eating the way they re supposed to he said adding that he has drained the funds set aside for his children s schooling to buy food a growing number of families across haiti can t even afford to do that since the protests began with barricades preventing the flow of goods between the capital and the rest of the country many of those live in haiti s rural areas which also have been hardest hit by demonstrations that continue in some cities and towns wadlande pierre 23 said she temporarily moved in with her aunt in the southwest town of les cayes to escape the violent protests in port au prince however she had to move back to the capital because there was not gas power or water in les cayes and food was becoming scarce advertisement there is no access to basic items that you need she said pierre is now helping her mother vanlancia julien sell fruits and vegetables on a sidewalk in the neighborhood of delmas in the capital julien said she recently lost a couple hundred dollars worth of produce because she could not go out on the street to sell due to the protests all the melon avocado mango pineapple bananas all of them spoiled she said last year sales were good but she is now making a third of what she used to earn before the protests began even though streets have reopened that doesn t amount to anything she said the fact that people don t go out to work it s less people moving around and makes it harder for me advertisement that also means businesses like the small restaurant that 43 year old widler saint jean santil owns often remain empty when they used to be full on a regular afternoon he said the protests have forced many business owners to lay off people which in turn affects him because clients can no longer afford to eat out if people are not working there is no business he said among the businesses that permanently closed was the best western premier hotel which laid off dozens of employees chalmers warned that economic recovery will be slow if the political instability continues adding that the situation is the worst haiti has faced in recent history a lot of crises came together he said not only the economic one but the political and fiscal ones send questions comments to the editors previous next
first a review of last week s events eur usd the euro rose sharply on monday this is not to say that no one expected it 35 of analysts and graphical analysis on h4 and d1 predicted the pair s rise to the height of 1 1100 some may have decided that the growth is associated with the performance of the new head of the european central bank christine lagarde but it is unlikely that this version is correct since the words of this high ranking official for the most part did not concern the prospects of monetary policy but were devoted to the prospects of the emergence of the crypto euro although the jet of fresh air in the work of the mega regulator could for sure contribute to the strengthening of the european currency the publication of business activity indices in the manufacturing sectors of germany and the european union which showed a small increase also added to the positive mood but as for macroeconomic statistics from the united states it did not make investors happy ism business activity indices in the manufacturing sector and the services sector showed a decrease as a result at its high the euro rose to 1 1116 the end of the week was without surprises as expected such an important indicator as the number of new jobs created in the us outside of agriculture non farm payrolls nfp increased by more than 70 and the markets immediately reacted by strengthening the dollar by 60 points then there was a slight rebound up and the pair froze at 1 1060 gbp usd it would seem that everything was supposed to freeze in anticipation of the parliamentary elections scheduled for thursday december 12 after all the future of brexit and the uk in general depend on them but the british currency was climbing steadily all week buoyed by predictions of an election outcome weak macroeconomic statistics from the us and the progress of the opec summit the british currency is strongly correlated with the black gold and the decision of oil producing countries to remove from the market starting from january 01 1 7 million barrels per day also supported the pound the gbp usd pair put the final chord of the week at 1 3132 adding more than 215 points in five days usd jpy according to the previous week s scenario the pair should have turned south reaching the height of 110 00 however it did it remaining some 25 points away from this landmark point and then everything happened exactly according to the forecast a fall to the support of 109 00 then a pause and a decline to the next support in the zone of 108 50 not far from it at the level of 108 55 the pair met the end of the trading session cryptocurrencies twitter brought an unexpected piece of news rather it was brought by the ceo of this social network jack dorsey who said that the future of the cryptocurrency industry will be determined by africa why just because africa is very poor and this will be one of the main reasons for the adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by the countries of this continent there may be some logic to this but for now what happens in the digital market is determined by the us europe and china last week europe distinguished itself it turned out that the european mega regulator is actively exploring the possibility of launching an official digital euro our goal said the new head of the ecb christine lagarde at a hearing in the european parliament is to create an innovative reliable and integrated payment system in europe this will benefit everyone in the euro area and significantly strengthen the euro s position in the world but then she added that it is necessary to assess all risks from such a step and weigh all the pros and cons very carefully as for the forecast for the past week it was absolutely correct on the whole recall that according to most analysts the pair btc usd was in for a sideways trend in the range of 7 000 8 000 at the same time 40 of experts did not rule out attempts to break the upper limit of this channel in reality everything happened like that starting near its upper limit the pair went down to the level of 7 095 then there was a sharp upswing on wednesday 04 december but the efforts of the bulls were only enough to lift bitcoin to the horizon of 7 865 this was followed by a sharp reversal a fall to 7 110 and then a return to the central zone of the channel accompanied by a decrease in volatility to the range of 7 330 7 465 quotes of top altcoins such as ripple xrp usd ethereum eth usd and litecoin ltc usd generally repeated the movements of the big brother and despite the fact that they were in the green zone at the end of the working week the result of seven days can be characterized as moderately negative thus ripple lost about 3 5 in price ethereum lost 5 and the cost of litecoin decreased by 9 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of experts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd the usa and europe expect three important events during the coming week these are the decision on interest rates by the fed on wednesday 11 december and the ecb on thursday 12 december as well as the scheduled elections to the uk parliament on thursday and if the fed and the ecb are likely to leave rates at the same level for now some surprises can be expected from the elections in the united kingdom the results of the exit polls will be known late on thursday central european time and the final results of the elections will be known on friday the 13th then we should expect a strong reaction of the markets despite the fact that friday the 13th enjoys a bad reputation among superstitious people the forecasts of experts are not so pessimistic 65 of them supported by graphical analysis on d1 vote for the growth of the pair to the resistance of 1 1100 and in case the opponents of a hard brexit win the elections in the uk the pair can easily reach the height of 1 1175 as for the forecasts until the end of december most analysts believe that the pair will move along the pivot point 1 1000 making fluctuations in the range 1 0900 1 1100 gbp usd as mentioned above the near future of the pound will be decided on december 12 in the meantime the experts can only shrug for those who prefer charts and candlestick patterns to fundamental analysis let s say that the graphical analysis on d1 draws the pair s growth first to the resistance zone of 1 3175 then to 1 3370 and the new year at the height of 1 3500 100 of trend indicators and 85 of d1 oscillators support this forecast the remaining 15 signals that the pair is overbought which indicates a possible reversal of the trend down usd jpy the pair is now within a strong support resistance zone clearly visible since april 2017 we can also talk about the sideway with the support at 108 25 which has started this fall most experts 65 believe that despite all efforts the pair will not be able to break through this support in the near future and therefore will move within the side corridor which started last october in their opinion if we see weak enough macroeconomic indicators in europe and latin america investors attraction to the dollar as a safe haven currency will increase and given the difference in interest rates the dollar will become much more attractive than the yen which will move the pair up the nearest resistance is 109 00 the next is 109 30 the target is 109 75 of course the quotes of this pair can also be influenced by the course of the us chinese trade negotiations and the results of the parliamentary elections in the uk therefore a bearish scenario is not excluded according to which the pair will rush to the minimum on october 03 106 50 intermediate supports are in the 107 90 107 50 and 107 00 zones 35 of analysts vote for this development as well as 70 of indicators on d1 cryptocurrencies the most important event of the coming week should be the launch of bitcoin settlement futures on the bakkt platform on december 09 and it is not for sure that this will help bitcoin there is an opinion that this platform is a hand of the us government able to strangle the crypto market at the right time or conversely give it a breath this version is confirmed by the fact that bakkt ceo kelly loeffler is already sitting in washington as a senator from georgia the pressure of regulators on the digital market and the desire to take it under control does not contribute to the growth of quotations of cryptocurrencies and the threat of instant large losses simply scares away large investors according to bloomberg this led to the closure of 70 cryptocurrency hedge funds in 2019 the number of newly created crypto funds has also decreased twice compared to the previous year so the predictions of bitcoin apologists that this cryptocurrency will rise again to heights in the region of 20 000 by the end of the year are unlikely to come true however according to ceteris paribus experts almost 600 thousand btc coins worth about 5 billion remain without movement over the past year and a half this speaks to the hopes of private investors for the rise of bitcoin the reason for this may be halving 2020 according to some crypto gurus the bitcoin rate can jump by 4000 as a result of this halving they cite the sharp jumps in the value of the main digital asset which occurred after the last two cuts in rewards for miners as an argument after the first cut it rose by 3420 after the second by 4080 however what happened to the litecoin halving of which took place at the end of the summer of 2019 shows that such rosy expectations may be in vain the ltc quotes indeed began to grow on the eve of this event but nothing happened on the halving day and then the ltc usd pair simply fell down returning to bitcoin let s say that the forecasts of most experts for december do not portend the btc usd pair anything good 65 of them see it in the 6 000 6 600 zone however once again a lot depends on how the opening trades on bakkt are going on for now the crypto fear greed index is still in its lower third at 29 which corresponds to the moderate fear of investors

via creditbubblebulletin dr bernanke has referred to the understanding of the forces behind the great depression as the holy grail of economics but was the great depression chiefly the consequence of post crash policy mistakes as conventional thinking has come profess was it really a case of the federal reserve having grossly failed in its responsibility to expand the money supply or did the previous roaring twenties bubble sow the seeds of a major down cycle and collapse having in the past carefully read through bernanke s writings on the twenties and subsequent depression it was clear his analysis had a fundamental flaw it disregarded momentous market dynamics that unfolded following the creation of the federal reserve system and recovery after the first world war the unprecedented buildup of speculative leverage throughout the twenties boom played an instrumental role in systemic liquidity abundance that fueled both financial distortions and economic maladjustment confidence in the federal reserve s capacity to sustain marketplace liquidity was instrumental in bolstering a progressively speculative market environment that culminated in the 1927 to 1929 speculative blow off there are those who believe the federal reserve should have acted even more aggressively when subprime cracked in mid 2007 more aggressive stimulus measures why not qe in 2007 and a lehman bailout would have averted the worst financial crisis since the great depression they believe as the late dr kurt richebacher would often repeat the only cure for a bubble is to not let it inflate certainly the longer bubbles expand the greater the underlying fragilities ensuring timid central bankers unwilling to risk reining in excess this was the problem in the late twenties and in 2006 2007 i would argue this has been a fundamental dilemma for central bankers persistently now for going on a decade especially after the bernanke fed targeted risk assets as the key system reflationary mechanism central banks have been loath to do anything that might risk upsetting the markets recall the 2011 exit strategy promptly scrapped in favor of another doubling of the fed s balance sheet to 4 5 tn by 2014 from my analytical perspective things have followed the worst case scenario now for over three decades alan greenspan s assurances and loose monetary policy after the 1987 crash spurred decade of greed excesses that culminated with bubbles in junk bonds m a and coastal real estate the response to severe early nineties bank impairment and recession was aggressive monetary stimulus and the active promotion of wall street finance gses mbs abs derivatives hedge funds proprietary trading etc once the boom in highly speculative market based credit took hold there was no turning back the 1994 bond bust ensured the fed was done with the type of rate increases that might actually impinge speculation and tighten financial conditions the mexican bailout guaranteed fledgling bubbles would run wild in southeast asia and elsewhere the ltcm russia market bailout ensured bubble dynamics turned absolutely crazy in technology stocks and u s corporate credit things took a turn for the worse following the tech bubble collapse with wall street cheering on the federal reserve fatefully targeted mortgage credit as the key mechanism for system reflation a doubling of mortgage debt in just over six years was one of history s more reckless monetary inflations the panicked response to the collapsing mortgage finance bubble fomented by far the greatest monetary inflation the world has ever experienced china em japan treasury debt central bank credit speculative leverage everywhere the global government finance bubble saw egregious excess break out at the foundation of finance central bank credit and sovereign debt it was a slippery slope no turning back the sordid history of inflationism has been replayed once monetary inflation commences it becomes virtually impossible to stop there was barely a pause following the ecb s 2 6 tn qe program before the electronic printing presses were fired up again the fed s balance sheet inflated from less than 1 0 tn pre crisis to 4 5 tn after contracting to 3 7 tn this past august it s now quickly back above 4 0 tn the bank of japan hasn t even attempted to rein in qe with assets at a record 5 3 tn up from the pre crisis 1 0 tn believing the bubble had burst in 2000 the fed saw no basis for not aggressively reflating the fed and global central bankers were convinced the bubble collapsed in 2008 it would be reckless not to proceed with history s greatest concerted monetary inflation whatever it takes was necessary to save the euro and european integration globally the scourge of deflation has apparently been lurking around every corner for a decade it was imperative for the bank of japan to demonstrate absolute resolve things got completely away from beijing having studied the japanese experience they failed to grasp the necessity of quashing bubble excess early over time gdp targets global power dynamics and the fear of bursting bubbles took precedence as it turned out the greater their bubble inflated the more heated the u s china rivalry in theory it seemed reasonable to let air out of the bubble gently in reality powerful bubbles only scoff as conspicuous as debt excesses and economic maladjustment became structural reform took a backseat to negotiations with donald trump a key credit bubble adage comes to mind there s never a convenient time to deflate a bubble my view is that chinese financial and economic fragilities were a major contributor to this past year s historic global yield collapse present a highly speculative marketplace a high probability of aggressive monetary stimulus and you re asking for a destabilizing blow off and in this strange world in which we live wild speculative credit market excess i e collapsing yields is viewed by nervous central bankers as a signal to employ aggressive monetary stimulus november non farm payrolls jumped 266 000 much stronger than expected and the largest job growth since january 41 3k returning gm workers the jobless rate declined to 3 5 matching low since 1969 as average hourly earnings gained 3 1 from november 18 for a fourth consecutive month of gains preliminary december university of michigan consumer confidence jumped to an above estimates 99 2 the strongest reading since may and only 2pts from the strongest reading going back to 2004 at 115 2 the reading on current conditions up 10 points since august jumped to a one year high the fed erred in cutting rates three times this year it was arguably a crucial policy blunder though in all likelihood the exact opposite will be argued in the future the fed should have stimulated more aggressively we can anticipate the assertion the fed flubbed last year in raising rates heck the federal reserve should have gone full japanese zero rates and qe indefinitely the s p500 ended the week with a year to date gain of 25 5 lagging nasdaq s 30 5 the nasdaq computer index has jumped 43 8 with the semiconductors sox surging 49 3 the banks bkx have enjoyed 2019 gains of 29 3 markets have virtually no concern the fed might actually reassess its policy course and reverse rate cuts what happened to mid cycle adjustment markets see only a 1 7 probability of a rate increase by the june 2020 fomc meeting while the probability of another cut sits at 42 9 curiously the bond market took friday s robust economic data calmly ten year treasury yields rose only three bps friday to 1 84 up 6bps for the week a delayed reaction wouldn t be surprising perhaps bonds are holding out hope for negative trade headlines but an asymmetrical fed policy bias no rate increase at least through next november s elections seems for now to work for both stocks and bonds it s difficult to define crazy i suppose you know it when you see it it s a central facet of bubble analysis that things get crazy at the end of cycles arguing that we re in the throes of the history s greatest global bubble we shouldn t underestimate craziness extremis bear markets and recessions have been rescinded stocks always go up debt and deficits don t matter the beijing meritocracy is up to any challenge global central bankers have things well under control i ve been thinking a lot lately about a key unheeded lesson from the mortgage finance bubble experience prolonged market distortions come with grave consequences the belief that the fed and treasury wouldn t tolerate a housing crisis was instrumental in the mispricing of finance that saw yields drop prices rise in the face of a doubling of total mortgage debt the perception of government imposed safety abrogated the market pricing mechanism supply and demand no longer dictated the price of mortgage credit the market became unhinged over the years i ve described how a bubble in high risk junk bonds would pose limited systemic risk if things heated up if issuance got out of hand the market would howl no more junk market discipline would essentially bring the boom to a conclusion prior to prolonged excess and the onset of deep structural maladjustment a bubble financed by money is perilous there is after all essentially unlimited demand for instruments perceived as safe and liquid stores of nominal value implied federal guarantees of gse debt and assurance of aggressive federal reserve reflationary measures in the event of instability bestowed the precious attribute of moneyness to mortgage related debt during that fateful bubble period moneyness of credit more than a decade ago i warned of the moneyness of risk assets with bernanke s reflationary measures having lavished the perception of safety and liquidity upon equities corporate credit and derivatives november 30 financial times chris flood global assets held by exchange traded funds have climbed to a record 6tn doubling in less than four years the sector s explosive growth has attracted heightened scrutiny by regulators who are concerned about the influence of etfs as they spread deeper and wider into financial markets worldwide passing the 6tn milestone is a historic moment but we are still in a relatively early stage of the industry s development as etf adoption rates across europe and asia are well below those seen in the us said deborah fuhr co founder of etfgi and if the incredible flows into perceived safe and liquid etf shares weren t enough is this the time to run to or away from the bond market december 1 financial times chris flood exchange traded funds linked to bond markets have attracted higher investor inflows than equivalent equity products this year in a highly unusual development in the history of the etf industry bond etfs have traditionally accounted for a fraction of the new cash entering the 5 9tn segment of the asset management world but this pattern has reversed in 2019 for the first time investors have ploughed 191bn into fixed income etfs in the first 10 months compared with less than 158bn in new cash gathered by equity etfs according to etfgi adoption rates have accelerated noticeably as more investors have realised that fixed income etfs can provide efficient solutions to some of the liquidity challenges of cash bond markets said deborah fuhr co founder of etfgi the mortgage finance bubble finally got into serious trouble when the blow off subprime mania had driven home prices to unsustainable levels speculators turned cautious financial conditions tightened the marginal subprime buyer lost access to credit home prices reversed the bubble faltered and the fringe of mortgage credit lost its moneyness those highly levered in mortgage securities lost access to funding and crisis erupted market and economic structures having become addicted to credit and liquidity excess were suddenly starved of both in a replay of the previous bubble government distortions have ensured a complete breakdown in market pricing mechanisms yields have declined securities prices inflated in the face of a tripling of federal debt and with central bank credit and government debt fueling the bubble markets breathe easily what could go wrong there s no subprime and home price dynamic that could bring the party to a bitter end and as the italian debt market has demonstrated market concern for the quantity quality and liquidity of sovereign debt can be alleviated through the expansion of central bank credit money so how might this all come to an end where is the current bubble s soft underbelly the area of potentially acute fragility december 2 bloomberg yalman onaran flare ups in the repo market could still cause worries across the global banking system more than two months after chaos subsided in this vital corner of finance of particular concern u s treasuries the world s biggest bond market and the place where the federal government funds its escalating deficit if repo rates become jumpy again and many are girding for that to happen in the middle and end of this month some of those leveraged investors may have to unwind treasury holdings potentially increasing the u s government s interest costs at a time of record borrowing if repos were much harder to get at reasonable rates treasury prices would drop said darrell duffie a stanford university finance professor who s co authored research on repo with federal reserve staffers the cost to taxpayers for funding the national debt would therefore rise global securities funding markets could well prove a critical weak link over recent months instability has erupted in china s money markets there have been indications of vulnerability in global dollar funding markets and of course there were september s repo market convulsions here at home the bloomberg article noted above included the following as u s government debt rose by 1 trillion in the 12 months through march more than 80 of it
