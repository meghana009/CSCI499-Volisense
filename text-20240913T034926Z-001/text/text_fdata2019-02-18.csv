the us dollar enjoyed strong gains in the first week of february but even a budget deal in washington failed to drive it higher with retail sales falling by the biggest amount in nearly a decade many forex traders are wondering if the us dollar is past its prime last week all of the major currencies held steady or traded higher against the greenback the new zealand dollar rose the most on the back of the reserve bank s monetary policy announcement the australian dollar was not far behind in gains but the japanese yen swiss franc and euro lagged behind a large part of these moves were drive by progression in us china trade talks and its positive impact on risk appetite the dow jones industrial average ended the week at year to date highs and further gains are likely if the us officially extends the march 1st trade deal deadline with no monetary policy announcements or major us economic reports on next week s calendar softer consumer spending will linger on everyone s minds however we ve been down this road before president trump says us china trade talks are going well the market believes him and rallies in the hopes that tariffs will be delayed reduced or eliminated days or weeks later the white house says there s too much division to reach an agreement at this time the us australian and new zealand dollars soared on the hope that with the march 1st deadline 2 weeks away trump s comment that trade talks are going well is a sign of real progress and not false promises trump said he s open to extending the deadline and could even remove the tariffs if a deal is done but until an agreement is signed sealed and delivered attitudes could change quickly what is certain is that another government shutdown is no longer a concern even though trump s decision to declare a state of emergency to get wall funding opens up new legal and legislative problems for now hundreds of thousands of federal workers won t have to worry about missing pay checks again and by returning to work they provide much needed underlying support for the economy because if retail sales dropped by its largest amount in nearly a decade before the shutdown the january numbers could be much worse the problem for the dollar is that economy is slowing and we are finally beginning to see the evidence not every one of this past week s economic reports surprised to the downside but the two most important measures for the fed inflation and spending missed expectations so fundamentally the dollar shouldn t be that strong especially since rate hike expectations have pared significantly since the last meeting however if a trade deal is reached between the us and china or china gets an extension the market s appetite for risk will return taking the dollar higher against the japanese yen there is a very good chance that the march 1st deadline will be pushed out so the slide in usd jpy will be limited but there s still significant upside for the australian and new zealand dollars until that happens though the softer retail sales report will continue to haunt the greenback especially as this week s fomc minutes remind investors that the central bank has no plans to raise interest rates soon
andrew sheng two major divorces are in the making in march the obvious one is brexit which officially occurs on march 29 the other is the deadline for the us china trade negotiations on march 1 when us tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent even though a trade deal is likely as both sides want to have a deal and the market is expecting one this will come down to the wire as the gap in what can be achieved in the deal is still daunting both negotiations have profound implications for years to come like all divorces the disagreements are acrimonious with second and third order costs on everyone else involved so far britain seems to be bracing for a major slowdown deal or no deal the british statistics office reported that the british economy grew only 0 2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth falling in december as bank of england gov mark carney warned in his global outlook last week the global expansion is now weakening and risks are intensifying because global monetary policy has been tightening trade tensions increasing and china is also slowing the more important risk he identified is the reversal of globalization caused by growing imbalance on the trade side due to the continued us current account deficit in a situation when the us dollar has been more dominant than ever interesting enough the chinese are no longer major buyers of dollars as their foreign exchange reserves have remained flat whereas going forward the us current account deficit will be funded more than ever by the japanese through their quantitative easing and also the eurozone expect us trade pressure also on japan and the eurozone the second globalization risk is social with greater imbalance in income and wealth in many countries because the benefits of free trade are shared unequally consumers overall benefit from global trade but many workers in advanced countries have either lost their jobs or seen a fall in real wages the third globalization risk is the loss of control and trust in democracy and sovereignty in many countries part of the problem is that barriers to trade have increased three times higher for services than for products and this hurts countries that are strong in the services trade such as the united states and the united kingdom this is where the growing protectionism is going to hurt everyone the bank of england estimates that an increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between us and its trading partners would take 2 5 percent of us output and 1 percent off global output through just the trade channel alone if nontrade factors are taken into account such as tighter financial conditions greater uncertainty and permanent tariff increases the output losses could double to 5 percent for us gross domestic product and half that for global gdp it is therefore not surprising that despite the recovery in the advanced economies business sector investments have not increased commensurately indeed uk business investments growth has fallen by 3 7 percent in the last year despite a recovery in growth profits and accommodative monetary policy carney s conclusion is that it isn t easy to win a trade war what is true for brexit is also true for us china trade disputes the barriers to reconciliation are huge because there are now fundamental differences in outlook approaches and territorial sovereignty on both sides of the atlantic english channel and the pacific business confidence cannot be good because in the case of investors in britain no one can predict with any certainty what deal is going to be struck including the possibility of a no deal either way investors will take on a low risk approach by avoiding long term investments and sticking to cash there is little doubt that in the short run britain will be the loser but with a flexible exchange rate it will be able to cushion any long term trade shocks with a competitive sterling at the same time the eurozone which sells a large portion of its cars and other products to britain would also have to deal with a trade shock on top of the internal complexities of keeping the union intact the yellow vest protests in france have weakened the ability of the french government to negotiate strongly with the germans on european fiscal discipline issues at a time when the italians are now making very different noises from the other partners on austerity immigration and foreign policy issues in the pacific zone the longer the us china trade tension persists the worse will be the investment climate overall major trading partners of both nations do not wish to make clear partnership choices given the huge potential size of the china market and limits to growth in the mature us market what is unspoken at the present moment is that if no deal is made exchange rate flexibility of the yuan cannot be ruled out no one wants to go this route because a competitive devaluation as the solution to a trade war can only lead to another global recession that is reminiscent of the 1930s so even though the west worries like carney about the risk of china s debt overhang the reality is that if china truly undertakes the structural reforms that almost everyone agrees on it will emerge more productive and competitive than before even in the face of higher trade tariffs with a balanced current account situation china has both the fiscal space and the monetary policy potential to undertake the necessary structural reforms and reflate domestic consumption at the same time this is because even if china buys more from the us the rest of the world would worry if that increase in imports comes at their expense all this means is that not only is the trade war negative directly for us consumers it will hurt trade and jobs for the rest of the world this is why feuding parties need to be realistic and come to terms that cannot be ideologically pure on either side for the us hawks to expect that the us can enforce standards on china is as realistic as china enforcing ideas on us hawks even for the mightiest military force in the world to sit down with the taliban is to admit that the us wins by losing wars negotiations are now down to the wire without any illusion as anything will be solved in the medium term as that is the negotiation style in washington expect nothing but higher political risks in the near future andrew sheng writes on global issues from an asian perspective ed
washington 17 february 2019 prnewswire policy on february 8 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf concluded the article iv consultation with nepal nepal s economy is enjoying a solid expansion supported by ongoing reconstruction activity following the 2015 earthquakes and increased growth in manufacturing and tourism related sectors real gdp is estimated to have expanded by 6 3 percent in fy 2017 18 mid july 2017 to mid july 2018 and headline inflation averaged 4 2 percent held down by subdued food price inflation government expenditure increased by 32 4 percent year on year in fy 2017 18 propelled by nepal s transition to fiscal federalism and ongoing reconstruction spending as in previous years spending was concentrated in the last quarter of the fiscal year revenue growth was also substantial 18 9 percent nevertheless the fiscal deficit increased to 6 5 percent of gdp from 3 1 percent of gdp in fy 2016 17 private sector credit has been expanding very rapidly in recent years posting 24 percent y y growth in december 2018 following average growth rates above 20 percent since fy 2015 16 the current account moved sharply into deficit position 8 2 percent of gdp in fy 2017 18 following a modest deficit of 0 4 percent in fy 2016 17 imports grew by 27 4 percent y y following a 30 percent expansion in fy 2016 17 exports also expanded by 15 5 percent but this growth applied to a low base exports comprised 3 1 percent of gdp in fy 2017 18 nepal s substantial trade deficit is partly financed by buoyant remittance inflows which grew by 10 2 percent y y in fy 2017 18 and were equivalent to 25 1 percent of nepal s gdp as of december 2018 gross official foreign exchange reserves held by the nepal rastra bank stood at us 8 3 billion having declined by approximately us 1 2 billion from the record set in january 2018 the near term outlook for growth is favorable but macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities continue to build growth is expected to reach 6 5 percent in fy2018 19 supported by ongoing reconstruction investment in hydro power projects and strong tourism related activity however fiscal and credit policies are very expansionary leading to rising non food inflation a widening current account deficit falling foreign exchange reserves and a buildup of financial sector vulnerabilities risks are tilted to the downside related to the financial sector and a possible slowdown in remittances executive board assessment executive directors commended the authorities on the pick up in economic activity in nepal supported by greater political stability more reliable electricity supply and reconstruction activity directors considered that the improved near term outlook provides an opportunity to address macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities and deep seated structural weaknesses and boost prospects for long term inclusive growth and the attainment of the sustainable development goals directors noted that expansionary fiscal and credit policies are putting pressure on the domestic economy through higher non food inflation and a buildup of financial sector risks and a wider current account deficit they recommended a policy tightening in the near term including through fiscal consolidation to avoid an abrupt slowdown and promote a more durable economic expansion directors welcomed the progress made in putting in place a fiscal federalism framework they noted that public debt remains low and encouraged continued efforts to strengthen tax administration and increase domestic revenue mobilization directors observed that more needs to be done to ensure fiscal sustainability make budgets more realistic and spending more efficient and build implementation capacity they agreed that with the devolution of responsibilities and resources to local and provincial levels efforts should be focused on building policy implementation capacity and instituting a sound public financial management framework at the subnational level directors considered that monetary policy should be tightened including to support the exchange rate peg to the indian rupee they noted that the recently initiated review of the central bank act provides an important opportunity to strengthen the central bank s operational autonomy and accountability while nepal s external position in fy2017 18 was moderately weaker than that consistent with medium term fundamentals and desirable policies directors expected that the proposed tightening of policies would help strengthen the external position to temper excessive credit growth directors encouraged a strengthening of macro prudential policies alongside an acceleration of financial sector reforms they concurred that banks should be encouraged to build additional capital and provisioning buffers against potential losses and financial sector oversight and regulations should be further strengthened directors encouraged the authorities to continue implementing the 2014 fsap recommendations and strengthening the aml cft regime in line with international best practices directors welcomed the authorities efforts to strengthen competition generate a more conducive environment for investment and reduce corruption they called for swift implementation of the structural reform agenda including revising public procurement laws and easing obstacles to firm entry and operations directors emphasized that increasing foreign direct investment strengthening governance and institutions and enhancing access to finance particularly for the underserved population outside major cities remain top priorities 1 under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement the imf holds bilateral discussions with members usually every year a staff team

after a dreadful end to the year global equity markets got off to a flying start in 2019 the us s p 500 index is up by 10 so far this year having fallen by 16 in the first three weeks of december the switch from gloom to cheer reflects a major policy shift by the us federal reserve the fed last autumn markets were braced for the fed to carry on raising rates through 2019 even though rates had already risen from 0 25 to 2 5 since late 2015 the fed was in hawkish mode and way ahead of other central banks in tightening monetary policy that hawkishness coupled with signs of a weakening in global and increasingly us activity caused december s equity sell off since then the fed has changed course signalling that the tightening cycle may already be over far from expecting the fed to hike rates markets think the next move will be a cut lower interest rates boost growth and the current value of future dividend income it s no surprise that the fed s volte face has buoyed equities the bank of england boe has followed the fed s lead pulling back from its rate rise plans citing a weaker global backdrop and brexit risks the european central bank ecb has chimed in saying it would keep interest rates at their current level of zero percent through the summer of 2019 and longer if necessary the view in financial markets now is that interest rates in the us the uk and the euro area will stay on hold through this year meanwhile the consensus among economists is that growth in the rich world will slow modestly this year with growth of 1 3 in the euro area 1 4 in the uk and 2 5 in the us these numbers are respectable and do not set alarm bells ringing yet the world is awash with risks from trade wars to a slowing chinese economy and asset bubbles all too often what has looked likely to be a modest downturn has turned into something far more severe what tools do the authorities have to prop up demand should things turn nasty the standard response would be to cut interest rates with rates at 2 5 the us has a fair amount of headroom to do so the uk at 0 75 has less scope and with euro area rates around zero the ecb is running on empty more controversial and suggestive of mounting risks to growth would be to restart quantitative easing qe the fed has an advantage on this front because it started tightening early the fed is the only central bank that is unwinding qe selling assets acquired during the period of extraordinary monetary ease slowing or stopping the pace of us quantitative tightening is a subtle form of monetary loosening that is available to the fed but not to the ecb and the boe which have merely stopped the net purchase of assets europe s central banks would need to restart their now terminated programmes of qe something which in policy terms would be akin to pressing a big red button labelled crisis with monetary policy ammunition running low it would be natural to expect government to bear more of the burden of getting growth going in the event of a downturn governments are running much higher levels of debt than ten years ago suggesting they too are constrained but borrowing costs are low and in an uncertain world investors seem to have almost inexhaustible appetite for the debt of large western governments last week the financial times ft reported that euro area governments have started to reverse years of austerity with most countries adopting expansionary fiscal policies which should bolster growth in the uk the government says that it would be prepared to increase spending in the event of a brexit shock the us is in a different position it enacted huge tax cuts in early 2018 stimulating the economy when it was close to full capacity by the end of this year the stimulus from the tax cuts will fade just as the economy is in need of a boost mr trump s recourse last week to emergency powers to fund his border wall suggests he might struggle to get money from congress to help bolster growth yet my sense is that the us is probably better placed to counter a downturn than the euro area the congressional battle over funding for mr trump s wall has certainly been toxic but it says little about the willingness of the democrats to fund infrastructure projects in the event of a major downturn indeed in the 2016 election one of the few areas on which mr trump and ms clinton agreed was the case for a substantial increase in public infrastructure spending germany has the scale and scope to ease fiscal policy in a way that would boost the whole of the region but it is resistant to doing so favouring strong public finances italy and france arguably have greater need for fiscal stimulus but their finances are weaker than germany s in the case of italy state indebtedness connects to the fragile condition of the banks which are heavily invested in italian government debt america is not alone in facing tensions on fiscal policy the recent stand off between brussels and rome over italy s plans for deficit financed spending attests to the tensions between the rules of the single currency and the preferences of member states those rules limit government deficit to 3 of gdp and debt to 60 something which places a constraint on the ability of some governments to boost their economies the euro area slowdown kicked in without the ecb even having tightened monetary policy that s worrying not least because it means that the ecb is facing a downturn with interest rates at zero the downturn in the euro area is advanced and deflationary risks look greater than in the states underlying or core inflation in the us is twice euro area levels at 2 5 there s plenty of scope to lower us interest rates and the fed can quietly ease policy by slowing the pace at which it sells assets the ecb would need to restart its qe programme that would be very big news as the euro area recovered in 2016 17 concerns about the long term challenges of low growth and an incomplete monetary union faded those problems have not gone away the way in which president macron s reform programme ran up against the gilets jaunes movement shows how things can change may s european parliamentary elections will provide an important eu wide test of the public mood the uk is of course on a different path an abrupt or disruptive brexit would generate intense pressure on the government and the boe to ease policy faced with the risk of a sharp slowdown or a recession i suspect the uk authorities would not sit on their hands and do nothing the slowdown in europe and the us is coming through a little faster than expected it looks manageable and orderly but then most major downturns start out that way policymakers would be wise to be thinking about how they d react if things were to turn nasty
tymoshenko s populist multi vector programme for the 2019 election yulia tymoshenko began her election campaign first among candidates and has according to estimates by different ukrainian ngo s spent the most on it tymoshenko was in the lead in every opinion poll until february and she has a good chance to be elected president in the second round of the elections in the third week of april the outcome of the british brexit referendum and 2016 us elections should make us cautious about opinion polls months before predicting the outcome of the referendum and election nevertheless because tymoshenko was in the lead in polls it is important to analyse seven areas of her election programme for clues as to what policies she would support if she were to be elected these seven areas are commitment to ukraine s democratisation and the rule of law limiting the influence of oligarchs reducing gas and household utility prices supporting reforms demanded by the imf continuing a unipolar or returning to multi vector foreign policy negotiating peace deals with russia bringing in china and reviving the budapest memorandum firstly there are fears tymoshenko similar to populists in the us poland hungary and elsewhere is not committed to democracy in 2008 09 tymoshenko and party of regions leader viktor yanukovych negotiated a grand coalition that would have kept them in power for a long time and was a factor in encouraging a large number of voters to back against all in the 2010 elections because they saw no difference between them public distrust in tymoshenko s commitment to ukraine s democratic system is long standing and she has failed to overcome this question according to analysis by rostyslav averchuk for vox ukraine post soviet presidential systems have indeed demonstrated the tendency for power to become excessively concentrated as many of them slided into authoritarianism and had the development of their parliaments and political parties stifled yet the chancellor system proposed by tymoshenko would most likely result in an even higher concentration of power than the one that is possible at least formally in the presidential system after all the leader of the party with a guaranteed majority in the parliament would also become a de facto popularly elected head of state and no other real center of political power would be there to check her powers effectively vox ukraine continues as a result were tymoshenko s ideas to be implemented political power could become as concentrated as it is in the super presidential systems in belarus kazakhstan or russia contrary to tymoshenko s arguments this particular system would surely lack checks and balances tymoshenko s policies are contradictory over whether she supports parliamentary systems as in the eu or presidential systems common throughout eurasia secondly although all ukrainian political parties even the communists and nationalists have been financially supported by oligarchs at the same time all political parties during election campaigns have adopted anti oligarch rhetoric petro poroshenko even talked of de oligarchisation although ukrainian voters see corruption and removal of oligarch influence as priorities at the same time they do not believe politicians who claim they will fight corruption and oligarchs in the 2019 elections tymoshenko has large financial resources as seen in her spending the most of any presidential candidate ihor kolomoyskyy has said that he supports the election of tymoshenko kolomoyskyy is ukraine s biggest corporate raider pryvat bank which was nationalized in 2016 money laundered 5 5 billion us dollars in 2008 prime minister tymoshenko gave kolomoyskyy de facto control over the state oil company ukrnafta which gave him huge corrupt incomes until it was taken back by the ukrainian state in 2014 15 it therefore remains unclear how tymoshenko can implement her election promise to change ukraine s oligarch clan model of governance and fight oligarchs thirdly a prominent tymoshenko billboard pledges to reduce the price of gas and utilities two fold certainly household utility prices low incomes and pensions and inflation are second only to the war in eastern ukraine as concerns for voters we will reduce the price of gas by half and this decision will be the first step of the new president accordingly the tariffs for heat and hot water will be reduced which will mean a significant reduction in utility bills tymoshenko said on the program pravo na vladu on the tv channel 1 1 the only manner in which tymoshenko explains how it would be possible to implement this election promise is to increase domestic production of gas and then provide this cheaply to the population how the government will intervene and force private companies to sell their gas at below market prices is not explained the only way this would be possible would be to return to using high levels of subsidies from the government which would increase the budget deficit or return to viktor yanukovych s practice of asking moscow for credits to buy russian gas the three policies of government intervention subsidies and foreign credits would represent a return to bad past practices prime minister tymoshenko attempted to intervene in oil pricing in 2005 with disastrous results although reducing gas and household utility prices are prominent in tymoshenko s election campaign it remains unclear how this can be achieved fourthly tymoshenko and batkivshchina have been the weakest supporters of reforms of the five pro western factions in parliament and their criticism of the imf has been as vitriolic as that coming from the opposition bloc this is an important factor to bear in mind as past actions and voting are an indication of future policies some western experts on ukraine such as london investment banker timothy ash believe that tymoshenko will become pragmatic if she is elected president after his december visit to kyiv ash wrote tymoshenko is likely to have to quickly moderate more populist political demands rowing back from plans for gas price cuts and to make meaningful management changes at the national bank of ukraine in other words tymoshenko like all populists uses populism to maintain her appeal with her voters for the elections but will drop these after being elected batkivshchina and tymoshenko opposed practically every reform since 2014 leading to vox ukraine ranking them the lowest in supporters of reforms of the five pro western factions tymoshenko is ranked a very low 330 of the 423 parliamentary deputies for her votes on reforms the opposition bloc batkivshchina and the radical party have provided the lowest levels of support for de centralisation one of the most important reforms conducted since 2014 will tymoshenko continue to be a lukewarm supporter of reforms and a major critic of the imf fifthly tymoshenko and batkivshchina are vehemently hostile to imf and yet they claim to be pro eu the eu us and world bank do not provide financial assistance until an imf agreement is in place tymoshenko has never explained where ukraine would receive financial assistance if not from the imf there is unease in washington with tymoshenko is a product of the lack of clarity in her domestic and foreign policies tymoshenko s fatherland party has been unenthusiastic about reforms and has strongly opposed key changes that have been linked to imf and us conditionality tymoshenko seems to want to have her cake and eat it by taking western financial assistance without implementing the attached conditionality tymoshenko s coolness towards the imf is found with other leading ukrainian presidential candidates such as anatoliy grytsenko while criticizing imf conditionality tymoshenko and the fatherland party she leads supports eu membership but financial assistance by the us and eu is only offered after an imf agreement is in place therefore tymoshenko s criticism of one organization and praise of the other are contradictory since 2014 the eu has given billions of euros in loans and grants and last year provided 600 million euros to help stabilize ukraine s finances the imf agreed to a 3 9 billion us dollar assistance package at the end of 2018 anti imf rhetoric is coupled with a promotion of economic isolationism tymoshenko said ukraine should rely solely on its own strength and not on external advice tymoshenko added if someone tells you that everyone in the world wants ukraine to be a strong and powerful competitor with its land resources and the intellect of the ukrainian nation it s not true the competition in the world is tough and sometimes brutal and nobody wants to raise our country except we ourselves economic and political isolationism and opposition to listening to foreign advice is at odds with tymoshenko s and batkivshchina s goals of ukraine joining nato and the eu during the process of joining these international organizations a prospective member is required to undertake detailed reforms and to allow brussels a very intrusive intervention into an applicant country s domestic affairs tymoshenko s contradictory politics certainly raises questions about whether her foreign policy would continue viktor yushchenko s and president poroshenko s pro western single vector or return ukraine to former president leonid kuchma s multi vector foreign policies new polls show the first three candidates as volodymyr zelensky poroshenko and tymoshenko of whom only poroshenko includes the goals of nato and eu membership in his election programme the sixth is an inconsistency on russia which has led to 28 per cent of ukrainian voters to believe that russia would like her to be elected as shown in sackur s interview with her tymoshenko has a problematic image over her attitudes towards russia particularly whether she as president would negotiate another bad deal with russia on the donbas like her bad 2009 gas deal in 2008 tymoshenko did not support ukrainian and western criticism of russia s invasion of georgia and instead vetoed a critical statement drawn up by hryhoriy nemyrya and us political consultant ron slimp especially during an election campaign with most candidates using anti war populism many ukrainian voters are concerned that she would negotiate a bad peace deal with russia if she were to be elected president the seventh question is related to tymoshenko s promotion of china as a partner in peace negotiations in the donbas which raised alarm bells during her december visit to washington china which is a staunch defender of its own alleged territorial integrity in sinkiang tibet and taiwan has sided with russia over crimea including china is part of tymoshenko s programme of reviving and widening the 1994 budapest memorandum to bring peace to the donbas as i have written elsewhere the budapest plus formula proposed by tymoshenko is completely unrealistic why is tymoshenko lobbying to bring in china into negotiations a country which has always voted with russia or abstained but has never once voted for ukraine and against russian military aggression since 2014 tymoshenko is not the only candidate in ukraine s presidential elections with nice promises and contradictory policies but she is leading in the polls and therefore has a high chance of being elected president which is why we need to analyse her policies now before election day taras kuzio is a professor in the department of political science national university kyiv mohyla academy and non resident fellow foreign policy institute johns hopkins university sais joint author of the sources of russia s great power politics ukraine and the challenge to the european order

months it has been inversely correlated by 0 1x with the uk equity market at the end of 2018 back to the level the company was launched at in the summer of 2014 the manager has temporarily reversed his bearish positioning whilst this is largely a tactical call it also reflects that recent market weakness and fears over the outcome of brexit negotiations has left many uk stocks on very low valuations many uk domestic stocks have been in an extreme bear market and should the performance of the uk economy post its planned exit from the eu in march prove not to be catastrophic for growth the manager believes uk centric stocks could bounce sharply stake in sanditon asset management sanditon asset management finished the year with assets under management aum of 549m a decrease of just over 5 since our last report and 4 lower than sam s previous year end march 2018 off which the last valuation was struck in the context of double digit declines for equity markets this was a creditable performance but nonetheless falling average aum means lower revenues i have highlighted before that extra costs associated with mifid ii will lead to some pressure on sam s profits so we expect the next valuation for sam to see a mark down in the value of our stake in sam time will tell whether a sharp improvement in sam s performance in 2018 with its key european long fund recording almost top decile performance in 2018 will translate into asset growth which in turn is key for its profit growth in the meantime sam continues to generate cash with cash balances of 5 5m at 31 december 2018 continuing to provide support to the valuation in sit s books continuation vote shareholders are reminded that sam s first continuation vote will be held in december 2020 charges and fees our total ongoing charges at 31 december 2018 were 1 3 per annum no performance fees have been paid or accrued outlook tighter global liquidity conditions slowing economic growth and a poor profit outlook may weigh on share prices in 2019 but significant market weakness in the last few months of 2018 has left pockets of value should the equity markets move away from chasing growth stocks we hope your company s strong value bias will help it to deliver positive returns in what is set to be another volatile year for financial assets rupert barclay chairman 18 february 2019 investment manager s report for the six months to 31 december 2018 overview the greatest and boldest operation ever undertaken by the federal reserve and it resulted in one of the most costly errors committed by it or any other banking system in the last 75 years so said the british economist lionel robbins in testimony to the us senate committee in 1934 about the federal reserve s loose monetary policy in the run up to the great depression we have no doubt in time that a modern economist will write something similar about the enormous mis use of quantitative easing qe and zero interest rates but for the moment the jury is still out on whether the policy has been a failure i have taken that quote from john galbraith s seminal book on the great crash of 1929 which is well worth re reading for its insights into investor behaviour history does not always repeat itself but it often rhymes as mark twain was attributed as saying reading j k galbraith s work again i was struck by how little has changed in respect of central bankers ability to inflate asset bubbles and the trust that investors place in the mystique of central banking it is usually investors who come off worse from having too much faith in the competence of monetary authorities the market s gyrations continued in the second half of 2018 finishing the year with almost every asset class down by approximately 10 it turned out there were few places to hide with even gold finishing the year modestly down readers will know that we have been bearish on asset prices and suitably gloomy about our own disappointing performance as markets rose whilst we have often been short however on the second last day of 2018 the uk s main index was slightly below the level it was when we launched your company back in the summer of 2014 we argued then that in an unprecedented era of loose monetary policy designed to inflate risk assets going forward preserving the real value of capital is going to be a significant challenge for all investors the challenge undoubtedly remains as we have now entered an era of quantitative tightening qt in the first half of your financial year the uk equity market fell by 11 but the net asset value of your company rose by 2 1 including the 0 5p dividend paid in december whilst we were slightly disappointed by this outturn it does highlight that the structure we have been running with since launch remains very lowly correlated with the performance of the underlying markets in which we invest we have not recovered the lost ground in 2017 but we have made a start and our relative performance has improved materially we were pleased that the improvement in performance has led to a modest recovery in the share price the weakness in equity markets in the second half coincided with us bond yields breaking decisively albeit briefly above 3 and the end of global qe a near 20 correction in nasdaq and some unhelpful goading by mr trump seemed sufficient to make the new governor of the federal reserve turn more dovish in his language when delivering the expected increase in us rates to 2 5 in december the market expected a further three interest rate increases in 2019 but now many commentators expect none from peaking at 3 24 in november the 10 year bond yield crashed back to finish the year at 2 68 as we have argued previously that it would not take much in the way of monetary tightening to cause a significant slowdown and remember we have had no tightening in europe or japan and the us economy has been helped by the massive easing of fiscal policy at the end of 2017 we cannot say we are too surprised at how quickly the fed has become nervous about its policy tightening but this is a problem of central bankers own making having flooded markets with years of excessive monetary easing leading to a huge build up in government and corporate debt see chart below on us corporate debt at the peak of this current economic cycle it is not surprising that investors are frightened the party is ending there may be bounces as central bankers try to assuage fears but the conventional arsenal for battling a new global slowdown which looks underway through much of the developed world is pretty empty alternatives such as peoples qe do not look very equity or bond friendly to us portfolio performance and structure the first six months of your company s new financial year saw your portfolio return 2 7 before charges the long book lost 6 4 but the short book gained 9 1 representing returns on capital of 11 6 and 21 5 respectively against the market return of 11 0 after reasonable outperformance from our long book in the first half of 2018 largely due to bids we reported on last time we were disappointed that our value oriented long book delivered a return slightly worse than the market this was in large part due to the performance of two of our top three holdings babcock and itv babcock fell by 40 costing your company 2 2 as hedge funds built up short positions and leaked fairly innocuous reports about how management weren t very good and their relationship with the mod its key customer was deteriorating speculative hearsay babcock s management have certainly made mistakes in the last six years notably their poorly timed acquisition of avincis but its share price performance bears no correlation either with its business performance or its valuation it finished 2018 on a p e of less than 6x and profit forecasts that were within 2 of the numbers expected at the beginning of 2018 hardly deserving of more than a third of the share price hedge funds who think shorting a stable business on such a low valuation is likely to be a profitable trade clearly hope that momentum stays their friend the chart above shows how qe s effect on different investment styles has been uneven we have argued and continue to believe that any unwinding of qe will have an equal and opposite effect on markets overall and on the investment styles that have led the bull market that is why we remain long value and short growth itv fell by 28 costing 1 5 leaving its shares on a p e of 9x itv has experienced greater downgrades than babcock forecasts have declined by 15 through 2018 as tv advertising has been hit by both a structural shift towards online and a cyclical downturn but the valuation seems to us to undervalue its production arm which makes about half of its profits itv remains the market s most likely takeover target and deservedly so on this rating we added to both positions during the half much more encouraging was the performance of our short book where the return on capital was almost double that of the market our shorts in growth stocks added 4 6 to nav and shorts in industrial cyclicals added 3 5 most of our contributions came from businesses warning on profits valeo fuchs sophos just eat or just a retreat from very high valuations ocado burberry intertek we expect 2019 will see more of the same and although we moderated our short towards industrial cyclicals in the second half of 2018 we are looking to rebuild into a bounce in the market overall we remain short growth stocks which have bounced again as bond yields have fallen in december it is interesting to us how a stock such as just eat where earnings forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have fallen by 30 since the start of 2018 for reasons we highlighted as likely in our previous reports only saw a share price fall of 25 in 2018 this tells us that the market s preference for growth stocks remain even in the face of evidence that too much faith is being placed in forecasts unrealistic growth forecasts suggest to us that this area of the market is likely to remain a profitable hunting ground for shorts it was pleasing that one of our shorts sophos cyber security software had two disappointing statements in 2018 and has warned again in 2019 leading to a fall of more than 50 in its share price we have temporarily used the substantial market weakness in the second half of last year to reverse our net short position of 28 by covering our futures short and going long the ftse future the use of futures is necessarily a short term tactical instrument and the most efficient instrument for changing the net exposure of your company quickly unfortunately we went long at the beginning of a december which turned out to be one of the worst on record for the market negating the contribution made from being short over the rest of the period our 40 net long is likely to be temporary all bear markets typically have sharp bounces after initial falls however we are also cognisant that unlike in the summer of 2014 when we started your company there are now a significant number of very lowly rated businesses nearly a quarter of the ftse 100 trade on under 10x 2019 earnings forecasts and further significant falls in equity markets are likely to lead us to running with a larger net long position on average than we have done since launch your portfolio retains its strong value bias with the average p e of its long book at 11 6x nearly a third of our short book p e of 32 8x excluding the currently loss making ocado should our thesis that a reversal in qe should lead to a reversal in market leadership prove correct we would expect to make progress in 2019 we have not mentioned brexit because at the time of writing it is still unclear what form if any it may take our view all along has been that brexit is very much a sideshow to the likely impact global qt will have on markets in as much as it has had an impact on u k domestic stocks in brexit baskets we imagine any resolution will lead to a sharp recovery in some of those share prices if you have any questions please feel free to contact either the

by brad tank chief investment officer fixed income what wall street s earnings results tell us about credit market opportunities in the now distant past when a financial market went through a bout of volatility the intermediaries who trade securities to provide liquidity for that market tended to clean up it s well known now that regulatory change the rise of electronic trading and evolving management practices have converged to reduce risk taking on the part of these market makers going back to 2010 the international monetary fund imf the federal reserve bank of new york and others have documented this in numerous studies looking at dealer balance sheet size trading volumes bid offer spreads market volatility and other pertinent factors after a 75 decline between 2008 and 2010 dealer corporate bond balance sheets have generally flatlined while trading volumes have trended higher over recent years bid offer spreads have also generally moved wider in the past higher trading volumes with wider spreads in q4 2018 would have suggested that we d see decent trading results from the dealers on the street in fact we have seen quite the opposite poor results for trading desks fourth quarter earnings reports reveal that at bank of america bac fixed income trading revenue was down 15 at citi c it was down 21 jpmorgan jpm which posted its worst bond trading quarter since 2008 saw revenues fall 18 the same decline experienced by goldman sachs gs and morgan stanley ms deutsche bank s slumped by 23 i cannot recall a period of similar volatility in bond markets that was followed by such poor trading results colleagues trading for our bond portfolios confirm what these numbers suggest the street closed up shop through december and virtually all trades had to be executed on an agency basis clearly there were seasonal dynamics as the sell off snowballed into the holidays but it is equally clear that structural change since the financial crisis including the impact of the volcker rule and basel iii has led to a collapse in banks ability to warehouse securities and deploy balance sheet liquidity for market participants the additional factor of management choosing not to trade also loomed large while on average dealers reported decent trading volumes for the quarter given all that was happening in the markets it is easy to argue that they should have been substantially higher unwillingness to trade was probably due to a combination of banks trying to preserve what for most had been a pretty good year with a stock market unwilling to reward risk taking evidenced by declining price to earnings multiples throughout 2018 false signals we have seen this before the start of 2016 came with high expectations of an imminent global slowdown just like today those expressing concern pointed to a confluence of general bad news on china and oil prices with the perceived signals from widening credit spreads and equity market volatility they played down ground level fundamental indicators such as housing starts or consumer confidence which appeared robust three years later it is clear that financial markets were flashing false signals as they flashed more investors tried to sell into illiquid markets and the signals flashed more urgently bouts of volatility will likely be more frequent and violent therefore and that means economic forecasting models built on financial market indicators are now likely to be wrongly calibrated flexibility as in 2016 last december a number of fundamental economic factors particularly in the u s seemed robust but risk appetite had evaporated and new bond issuance was on hold that technical picture set the scene for a major bounce as we saw through january to benefit an investor needed the flexibility to provide liquidity when it was most in demand but also had to look through the market s false signals to find the conviction to do so flexibility can come through robust portfolio construction with an emphasis on liquidity management in practice that means even a pure high yield portfolio would need bonds that can be sold in just about any conditions alongside a focus on forward cash flow from nominally illiquid assets in multi sector portfolios mortgages which can generate ample cash from both coupons and amortization may have an interesting role to play for example these can be boring ways to facilitate some exciting opportunism dealers unwillingness to trade is ultimately an opportunity for traditional long term investors to step in and fill the void at what could later prove to be very attractive prices with the view expressed in our latest fixed income quarterly outlook calling for a soft landing for the u s economy we had the confidence to do just that with many of the

published monday 18 february 2019 print disqus modern monetary madness pet economists can this really be a thing sound bite economics do deficits matter strategic investment and life planning dallas houston cleveland a lot new york back to puerto rico austin and dallas more than 10 years ago some australian readers begin regaling me with the ideas of economist bill mitchell of the university of newcastle in new south wales he was teaching about something he called and he coined the term modern monetary theory i looked into it and fairly quickly dismissed it as silly actually printing money as an economic policy get serious mmt is a revival of an early 1900s idea called chartalism now it is influencing the thinking of new socialist like movements in the us and other places and cited by politicians mmt is increasingly appearing in mainstream media like this sobering financial times article since it is increasingly discussed in more public venues you should know more about it and that will be today s topic before we go into that i want to remind you that priority pricing for the strategic investment conference ends on monday february 18 you can save up to 1 000 over the final registration price on tuesday the price goes up substantially it s the best lineup of speakers i ve ever had if i have room at the end of this letter i ll mention them for you but you can look on the link and see the speakers yourself twenty nine speakers plus yours truly not including some well known names as panel moderators by popular request there will be more panels and speaker interaction this year than ever attendees all mentioned how much they enjoy discussing the conference with fellow attendees and making new friends and especially that the speakers make themselves available to attendees as much as possible frankly many of the speakers will attend most if not all of the conference it is simply that good so don t procrastinate save yourself some money by clicking on the link and registering today and make sure that we don t have to tell you we sold out again registrations are ahead of schedule so there is a real chance even with the larger venue that that could happen here is a quick video in which i tell you more i hope you catch my enthusiasm join me in dallas now on with our letter modern monetary madness essentially mmt espouses that the public through the government owns the process of money creation and that in addition to borrowing and taxing should simply issue currency as payment for its obligations this is not the sleight of hand that quantitative easing was this is direct monetization in lieu of borrowing if that sounds like printing money that s because it is upfront and in your face as a serious economic proposal most of the time when i am talking with my fellow writers and economists when somebody mentions mmt everybody smiles maybe chuckles and shakes their heads the problem is what seems like a joke is actually getting traction let s get the official definition of mmt from wikipedia my comments inserted are in brackets in mmt vertical money money created by the government and spent in the private sector enters circulation through government spending taxation and its legal tender enable power to discharge debt and establish the fiat money as currency giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met in addition fines fees and licenses create demand for the currency an ongoing tax obligation in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency maintains its value because the government can issue its own currency at will mmt maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending the government s deficit spending or budget surplus is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment and not a means of funding the government s activities by itself proponents argue that unemployment is caused by lack of demand and lack of demand is caused by insufficient money entering the private sector a problem the government can solve by creating money and spending it in the private sector voil demand is created and unemployment goes down inflation that can be controlled by higher taxes hey it s their theory don t ask me to explain it economists advising major presidential and congressional candidates on the progressive and even moderate left are more and more openly talking about mmt and its practical applications pet economists i have said before that economists are the modern day equivalent of shamans and priests rather than looking at sheep entrails economists look at data and tell the politician king emperor or chief what they want to hear i have been in more than one meeting where a politician is clearly shopping for a rationale for something that they would like to propose and do any serious politician is going to have more than a few economic advisors attached in one form or another to their campaign let me quickly state that i am not disparaging the role of economists when they act as political advisors i have done that myself it is actually one of the rationales for the discipline indeed it would be strange if that were not the case can this really be a thing 90 of readers may wonder why we are even talking about this in a serious letter the rest of you may tell me how i m wrong and it really will work let me hasten to say that 10 years ago it was much less than 1 and it is beginning to come from readers that i recognize to be fairly serious there are multiple and growing motivations and rationales for adopting mmt into your own philosophical base why should this be on your radar let me give you just a few scenarios politicians are increasingly talking about free stuff free college guaranteed basic income more total healthcare paid for by the public basic housing and more it is almost like there will be an auction to see who can promise the most free benefits paid for by taxes on the rich they will cite economic advisors who say it is completely doable and even necessary for the general welfare the richest country in the history of rich countries can easily afford to spend more on its citizens ensuring basic income and wealth equality more or less a direct quote from several interviews forget mere income taxes the new political ante will be a wealth tax that means these ideas will be increasingly promoted in the public space more politicians will argue for increased spending and or at least different spending priorities guns and butter over the next few years this will enter the national mindset an increasingly large group of voters especially younger voters will feel a natural affinity with the idealism why shouldn t a rich nation help those who are less advantaged then somewhere while we are having this conversation there will be a recession unemployment will rise and deficits increase until we are on our way to a 30 trillion debt in just a few years this will crowd out private investment slowing whatever recovery there might be and making us vulnerable to a quick second recession not unlike the recessions of 1980 and 1982 but it will also produce the potential for a true change election the frustration noted among trump voters will still be there but it will also be shared by many on the left who will see the promises as a way to change things it is hard to argue in the middle of financial crisis and recession that we don t need change there won t be a president warren harding who essentially decided to do nothing in one of the deepest recessions depressions in american history in the early 1920s in that case severe austerity allowed markets to clear but the recovery gave us the roaring 1920s cause and effect numerous scholarly books have been written to suggest that but that will not be the case 100 years later as we face the 2020s there will be an increasing drumbeat for doing something change will be the mantra it is not far fetched to imagine a white house and congress beginning to work around the principles of mmt if not adopt it outright with sharply higher taxes and spending now here s where it gets a little bit murkier the federal reserve even if a new president could pack the board with members philosophically attuned to a new president s desire to increase public spending through monetary creation does not have the legal authority to directly create money that is a right reserved strictly for the federal government and specifically the us treasury the treasury can issue all the debt into the private sector it wants the federal reserve can then go into the private market and buy all the debt it wants adding that debt to its balance sheet this is called quantitative easing it is technically not the same thing congress has tried to create agencies which would use the federal reserve to directly create money these agencies and methods have all been ruled overwhelmingly unconstitutional by the supreme court for the federal reserve to create money as mmt advocates want you would have to amend the federal reserve act certainly a possibility but not easy sound bite economics proponents of mmt point to how successful japan has been in implementing what essentially looks to be the same policy they have moved 140 of their gdp under the balance sheet of the bank of japan essentially buying every bond available in the private markets their balance sheet is growing because they are buying stocks and carrying japan s entire annual deficit which is large why can t we do the same japan and the us are both modern countries and economies europe though not to the extent of japan also engaged in a large amount of quantitative easing if it didn t cause problems the last time why not try it again on a larger scale especially if there is a crisis the explanation for japan not having inflation or hyperinflation doesn t fit into a sound bite and mmt proponents can answer it with dismissive sound bites that will be readily consumed and believed by a public wanting change coupled with automation increasingly taking jobs and depressing wages it will be a firestorm of political backlash and calls for change do deficits matter the only way to really tackle the increasing deficits is to reduce medicare and medicaid benefits means test social security and at the same time raise the age of eligibility but few politicians will run on a platform of cutting medicare and social security because no matter how they propose it that will be what it means raise medicare and social security taxes or simply increase taxes on everyone or at least the rich a lot the definition of the rich would have to be lower than you might think most of my readers will be seen as the rich whether you feel rich is beside the point that will still not balance the budget but there s a high probability that it will send us into yet another recession bringing calls for more direct spending and some form of money creation as the answer that s what mmt says we should do any politician who proposes to limit entitlement spending to balance the budget will be accused of forcing austerity on those least able to afford it that is not a winning platform there will be no clinton gingrich compromise austerity has no fun and simple sound bites it requires a certain amount of pain which is generally not politically popular oh a segment of the population will embrace such but we must remember that elections are won on the margin president trump won by razor thin margins in a few midwest states a change election in the middle of a recession or its aftermath could not only see those margins evaporate but bring a wave of progressive and socialist politicians to join aoc and her friends think 1932 the country was in true turmoil and there was a huge shift to the left fdr didn t get every policy he wanted but he got a lot of them it was truly transformational and has impacted the us for the last 100 years what would this look like how do we get there we are going to have several sessions at the strategic investment conference to specifically address these issues is all this going to happen next year no but something along the above line is my base case for the 1920s that means you need to begin structuring your life and your portfolios to avoid being in a tunnel with an oncoming train these are not simple changes like simple buy and sell instructions but will require much deeper structural change in not just your portfolios but perhaps your lives it is something you want to think very seriously about while you have the luxury of time and not wait to the last minute waiting too long may mean you won t be as prepared as you will wish think about how you would deal with taxes 20 or 30 higher or more than today s and potentially more how would that change your lifestyle what can you do today to deal with whatever may come it may mean adjusting your lifestyle saving more and getting out of debt which takes time for most families these are not quick decisions but i think they will become necessary ones especially if the first wave of a change election happens in 2020 bluntly shane and i have already begun our own changes if somehow there is eventually a change back to austerity or a crisis forces it that will mean even more change you need to be prepared for and unfortunately it s not clear what will happen we will have to get much closer to the actual events and elections to get a feel for the way actual events may develop strategic investment and life planning this year s sic has perhaps the widest range of topics and speakers i have ever assembled every speaker is designed to help you plan for 2020 and beyond what should you do today what should you do to begin to get ready for change what might those changes look like where are we currently in the investment cycle bull or bear market i have numerous cycle and market experts presenting there will be several panels focused specifically on government debt and deficits and more than a few sessions on china and europe the speakers on china and the panels will be eye opening the china panel will be explosive there are experts you may not be familiar with who have much different viewpoints it is a bit of a personal coup to get them all on the same stage while they will be making separate presentations i m going to have bill white and lacy hunt on the same panel talking about central banking and debt bill white for those not aware was the chief economist for the bank of international settlements and my favorite central banker housing and interest rates are critical to the us economy and i have invited john burns and barry habib my go to guys when it comes to housing and mortgages to open up that world to us who better than jeffrey sherman from doubleline to talk about interest rates i am technically not allowed to say he might be a better speaker than his boss jeff gundlach mark yusko grant williams louis gave of course george friedman will be there david rosenberg will once again be my lead off hitter and will be one of the speakers staying and mingling for the entire conference and of course you have to deal with energy in a serious way you re in texas a final closing morning with howard marks carmen reinhart and bill white talking about central banks government debt and how we deal with it i am really looking forward to the final panel seriously can it get any better we re going to do a special session with pat caddell and neil howe talking about the elections of 2020 and the political climate of the 2020s caddell was predicting a populist like trump to win years before 2016 neil was talking about the generational angst that is developing these are the two guys who got it right and have been getting it right for a long time i want to know what they re thinking now and so do you and they will also be there for the entire conference so you can access them in a break or even sit with them at one of the many dinners and lunches i am more excited about this conference than any other for the last 16 years you are simply not going to want to miss this register today and save 1 000 don t procrastinate join me for three power packed days and frankly a lot of fun i look forward to meeting you personally dallas houston cleveland a lot new york back to puerto rico austin and dallas shane and i will be traveling to dallas at the end of this week to begin to get ready to move the rest of our furnishings to puerto rico or to a new smaller apartment that will be our dallas base right now it appears my dallas high rise home will sell within a few weeks after an ashford inc board meeting in athens texas i make a quick dash to houston to meet with my smh friends and then a meeting with an economics council at rice university my alma mater then it s back to dallas for a few days and then on to puerto rico starting in the middle of march i will be staying in the cleveland area where i will have two separate cataract surgeries over a few weeks maybe get a quick visit to new york eventually back to puerto rico and then in early april i have dinners with clients and potential clients in austin and dallas and then thankfully the rest of april looks mostly free of travel when i write to you about the potential for needs for lifestyle changes i am also talking to myself and taking action if there is any interest maybe i will do a private session on what changes i am making at the sic but everyone s life and reality is different i am still thinking through and making those changes it s time to hit the send button this has been an interesting letter to write more speculation than economic rationale but i can guarantee you this is something i worry about and i think you should consider what it might mean for you have a great week your making his own changes analyst john mauldin chairman mauldin

bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm politics mboweni s budget must be a people s budget saftu federation says workers and poor should not yet again have to pay price for problems caused by corruption saftu demands a people s budget 18 february 2019 albert einstein is widely credited with saying the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results tito mboweni s 2019 budget speech on 20 february 2019 will be delivered in the midst of south africa s biggest crisis since 1994 but saftu has no expectation that he will deliver any solution to this crisis he will deliver more of his predecessors catastrophic neoliberal business as usual policies which caused today s crisis in the first place policies dictated by the credit ratings agencies on behalf of multinational big business for nearly 25 years now the anc government has implemented an inappropriate macroeconomic policy framework that has led to economic stagnation worsened unemployment deepened poverty and made south africa the worst country in the world in terms of inequality this gear growth employment and distribution macroeconomic and fiscal policies included massive corporate tax cuts at a time when the world expected that we would introduce wealth and solidarity taxes to close the gap between the white and black inequalities we inherited from apartheid the anc government introduced monetary policies that led to the cutting of exchange controls resulting in billions leaving our shores money we so desperately needed to build new industries government allowed our big companies to shift their listing to london and new york again robbing our economy of resources we need the anc introduced inflation target policies of between 3 and 6 as if this is not enough of a sabotage of the development agenda the anc did nothing to stop illicit cash and trade outflows and mispricing that cost the economy billions these have been the anc government s policies since the imposition of the gear strategy in 1996 which ensured that economic power would remain in the hands of the same mainly white capitalist class and that financial policies would be dictated by their interests workers and the poor will now yet again have to pay the price though tax increases and cuts in spending on key public services which will lead to even more job losses in both the public and private sectors one of gear s biggest champions was former finance minister trevor manuel who boasted in 2008 that he had achieved a budget surplus for the first time since 1958 he achieved this through austerity budgets for the poor with tax cuts for the rich his budgets robbed us of the resources the country required to meet the basic needs of the poor black majority who remain trapped in the apartheid racial fault lines these neoliberal policies together with inaction to stop illicit cash flows foreign listing of companies the removal of exchange controls and reduction tariffs have all contributed to the current economic catastrophe in which economic growth last year was below 1 and the world bank estimates it will be no more than 1 3 this year which will not keep pace with the expected 1 6 increase in the population unemployment at 37 0 is the one of the sixth highest in the world still more job losses loom with threatened retrenchments in eskom the mines the public service and possibly the sabc saa and edcon 55 of the population live in abject poverty and six million children live below the food poverty line inequality is the world s highest executives salaries have risen from 50 times bigger than workers wages to 500 times bigger the share of wages in gdp has plummeted from 57 in 1991 to below 50 inequality has also grown by cuts in the social wage spending on public services by years of austerity budgets the two tier level of service delivery remains and is widening education remains starkly divided between well endowed private schools for a wealthy mainly white minority while most public schools for the majority are under staffed ill equipped and often structurally derelict public hospitals and clinics struggle with over worked staff lack of drugs and long queues for treatment while the rich can pay for quality private service 14 of south africans still live in shacks and backyard dwellings all these problems have been made far worse by the wave of corruption theft and fraud by public officials soe executives political leaders and their cronies in the private sector which has lost the country an estimated r27 billion a year workers and the poor will now yet again have to pay the price for all these problems through tax increases and cuts in spending on key public services which will lead to even more job losses in both the public and private sectors at the top of mboweni s agenda will be measures to reduce the debt gdp ratio level which stands at almost 60 and eskom s massive r420 billion debt which amounts to 15 of all national debt eskom s debt crisis has now coincided with the latest round of load shedding the failure of generators including the two new ones at medupi and kusile and the attempt to impose massive tariff increases this has already wreaked havoc for both domestic users and manufacturing and commercial businesses if not rectified this crisis will lead to an economic implosion of the entire economy for which electricity is its life blood thousands more jobs will be at risk and living standards will plummet what mboweni will not admit however is that the root cause of this crisis was a decision of by his predecessor trevor manuel who in 2009 while boasting about his budget surplus refused a request from the eskom board for a r1000 billion recapitalization programme this was so as to weaken eskom and eventually hand it over to the private sector a process continuing with the plan to introduce ipps to compete with eskom so that eskom will subsidize the private sector and continuing with the plan to eskom into three components generation distribution and transmission saftu views this as concealed privatization and is therefore a declaration of war eskom s disaster has been compounded by a decade of corruption incompetence mismanagement and sabotage involving board members private suppliers including gupta owned companies and the anc s investment arm chancellor house which all robbed the public of billions of rands this also led to the massive structural problems and faults at the new power stations which numsa members pointed out years ago but which were ignored in order to cover up the corruption involved in the contracts with the company which built them mboweni knows that eskom is too big to fail and that his budget will have to include a bail out which will once more be paid for by the public with more tax increases and even bigger cuts in public spending on everything in the public sector saftu demands that it is those responsible for the disaster not the workers and consumers who must pay back all the stolen money members of eskom s past and present boards its corrupt suppliers in particular coal suppliers and those in government who oiled the wheels of the hijacking of this public utility those guilty of crimes must be brought to justice and punished mboweni will also not admit that the underlying problem at eskom and in the economy as a whole is that they are owned or in eskom s case managed by a capitalist class who are only interested in making as much money as possible as quickly as possible and without any regard for the dire consequences of this for the workers consumers and the whole country eskom must remain in public ownership but not run as if it had already been privatised it has to be taken out of the hands of corrupt business representatives and run democratically by elected representatives of the workers consumers and the state who must be subject to recall and punished if they repeat the crimes of the former bosses saftu insists that energy including renewables water education healthcare public transport information dissemination public transport including access to roads and security of citizens amongst others should be in the hands of the people as a whole and are too critical to be used for for making profit saftu demands a people s budget which will increase taxes on the rich recover their unpaid taxes and illicitly exported funds stop the laundering of money into tax havens a programme to reverse the deep social expenditure cuts and to increase spending on vital public services and job creating initiatives issued by patrick craven saftu acting spokesperson 18 february 2019
however issues unique to the domestic economy remain though showing tentative evidence of settling now australia s falling property market is an issue of ongoing concern as are issues of uncomfortably high private debt levels low wages growth and its impact on inflation and the generally sluggish state of the australian consumer 5 the doomsayers argument there will always be doomsayers in the world so gloomy forecasts ought to be met with critical objectivity it s the way the rba however right or wrong they happen to be at any point in time attempt to approach the world their base case is very unlikely to be that the australian economy is heading for some sort of catastrophic recessionary set of circumstances there are many in the punditry however with cogent arguments as to why recession is a reasonable risk to consider the position that the onerous burden of high household debt in the face of tighter financial conditions low wage growth and a reverse wealth effect will accelerate the housing market s collapse and spark some housing led recession is probably the most headline grabbing and generally evocative of these 6 all this talk of australia s 08 moment such a set of circumstances it s envisaged would be australia s dose of the gfc it never received in 08 when a booming china protected the australian economy from the many ills of that disaster there is unconscious obsession probably brought about by the trauma of the event to contrast any market event with those of 08 in 2019 australia the parallels intuitively exist just like the us in 08 household debt is high house prices are falling courtesy of the stifling of a hitherto speculative euphoria in the market and consumers have fewer means to keep consuming or protect themselves from a period of economic malaise the prospect of less favourable financial and economic conditions could be what it takes to turn a garden variety economic slow down into something more serious 7 worst case not the likely case but still good to know once more this crudely described series of events is what can be called in financial market parlance a tail risk a low probability but very high impact event it s not what the rba would be considering as their base case for what lays ahead for the australian economy in 2019 especially so the doomsayers opinion won t slip its way into today s rba minutes arguably even it came close to becoming that way at any stage the pr machine that is the rba are unlikely to ever reveal completely a true pessimism about australia s economic health knowing the worst case scenario market participants is handy though if it can be done so objectively it provides an intellectual tool to examine how close we are to coming to falling off the precipice we fear 8 market watch spi futures up 4 points to 6056 at about 5 15am aedt aud 0 2 to 71 28 us cents wall st closed for presidents day in europe stoxx 50 0 1 ftse 0 2 cac 0 3 dax flat spot gold 0 3 to us1326 34 an ounce at 12 46pm new york time brent crude 0 1 to us66 30 a barrel us oil 0 6 to us55 93 a barrel iron ore 0 2 to us88 32 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 8 to 636 yuan lme aluminium 0 2 to us1856 a tonne lme copper 1 4 to us6275 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 51 australia 1 74 5 year yield us 2 49 australia 1 77 10 year yield us 2 66 australia 2 14 germany 0 11 us australia 10 year yield gap 52 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
saudi arabia has always kept close business and economic ties with pakistan and upcoming investment of billions of dollars will give a fresh impetus to the decades long partnership between the two countries the new investment is critical for pakistan s economy as the pakistan tehreek e insaf government has been striving since coming to power about six months ago to stimulate heavy foreign investment into the country the economic partnership between pakistan and saudi arabia is not new it has a history spread over decades as pakistan faced deep economic challenges at regular intervals saudi arabia has always provided vital economic cushion to cope with the crises this has come in the form of investments loans aid and manpower import between 1973 and 1980 pakistan received a loan of 502 million at critical junctures to meet international obligations in 1998 when pakistan faced an economic crisis after the international community imposed crippling economic sanctions in the wake of nuclear tests saudi arabia extended a helping hand by offering a free oil supply facility worth 4 5 billion that facility constituted 23 of pakistan s total oil imports pakistan received 80 000 barrels per day bpd for two years and later got 40 000 bpd which helped ease pressure on the balance of payments saudi arabia also came for pakistan s rescue after a devastating earthquake in the country s north in 2005 with an aid package of 573 million for relief and rehabilitation efforts in that regard saudi arabia established an organisation called saudi public assistance for pakistan earthquake victims later when major floods devastated many parts of pakistan in 2010 riyadh announced another aid package of 105 million and became the largest international donor to pakistan over the past few years saudi arabia has been offering financial bailouts to pakistan for balance of payments support and has deposited millions even billions of dollars in the state bank of pakistan sbp to boost the foreign currency reserves in 2009 it deposited 200 million with the sbp and in march 2014 gave 1 5 billion as a gift to lessen pressure on the balance of payments recently it has again come forward and has deposited 3 billion with the sbp for bolstering the foreign exchange reserves in addition to this it has agreed on an oil credit facility of 3 billion for the next three years apart from the financial bailouts saudi arabia has also given soft loans to pakistan in 2009 a 100 million credit facility was provided for urea import from the kingdom similarly it gave a soft loan of 80 million for the construction of neelum jhelum hydroelectric power project in february 2014 during the visit of then crown prince salman bin abdul aziz both the countries inked agreements on new soft loans for pakistan under this arrangement the kingdom provided 125 million for urea import from a saudi company moreover a soft loan of 58 million was made available through the saudi fund for development of pakistan for the golen gol hydroelectric power project in chitral remittances have been a major source of foreign currency for pakistan and in this area too saudi arabia has played a prominent role as millions of pakistanis are based in the kingdom in the 1960s when a boom in saudi arabia s oil industry created employment opportunities in scores of sectors like the construction industry saudi arabia turned focus to pakistan and invited skilled and unskilled manpower pakistan has since exported skilled semi skilled and unskilled workers to the kingdom which has been an attractive destination for pakistani workforce because of being a muslim country and also due to the presence of holy sites in makkah and madina pakistani expatriates are working in saudi arabia s construction services and oil industries among others between 1971 and 2005 2 8 million pakistani workers went to saudi arabia for employment and in 2018 their total number was estimated at 5 3 million making a significant contribution to the economy of saudi arabia and sending billions of dollars in remittances to pakistan they contribute around 4 billion in remittances per annum saudi arabia has also been a key trade partner of pakistan due to oil imports and the trade has been in favour of the former in 2013 14 total trade volume between the two countries stood at 5 084 million of which exports from pakistan were calculated at 505 4 million against imports of 4 578 million however the trade volume came down to 3 519 20 million in 2017 18 bilateral trade stood at 1 990 46 million in july january of the current fiscal year against 1 924 27 million in the same period of previous year owing to the recent fast growing ties the trade volume is likely to pick up pace pakistan s main export goods include textile rice honey mangoes mutton beef spices fruits vegetables light engineering goods leather products and chemicals on the other hand its major import items include crude oil petrochemicals plastic and plastic products organic chemical products fertilisers aluminium and its products precious metals steel castings rubber and paper saudi arabia has long been a leading investor in pakistan its investment stood at 263 11 million in december 2015 during the visit of crown prince salman bin abdul aziz in february 2014 avenues for expanding saudi investment in varying sectors such as oil and gas mining energy it telecommunication food and agriculture were explored pakistan has invited saudi business community to invest in the country as it offers an attractive 37 annual dividend on foreign investment in a bid to institutionalise economic cooperation and strengthen mutual coordination and linkages the pak saudi joint ministerial commission jmc was established in may 1974 jmc is at the core of efforts to expand commercial cooperation between the two countries ten sessions of jmc have been held in riyadh and the last one was organised in april 2014 both sides discussed new opportunities for cooperation in scores of fields as pakistan sought saudi investments in infrastructure building trade banking information technology and telecommunication pakistan has valued its relations with saudi arabia because riyadh has a unique and central position in the muslim world following the visit of saudi crown prince in 2014 its investment in pakistan increased which reached 421 4 million in 2016 with the arrival of crown prince mohammad bin salman the two countries are poised to sign billions of dollars worth of agreements these include the setting up of aramco oil refinery in gwadar saudi aramco has a long history of achievements and it will establish its footprint in pakistan by setting up a refinery with production capacity of 250 000 to 300 000 bpd aramco traces its beginning to 1933 when a concession agreement was signed between saudi arabia and standard oil company of california a subsidiary company california arabian standard oil company was created to manage the agreement after surveying saudi deserts drilling for oil exploration began in 1935 crude oil production of aramco arabia american oil company reached 500 000 bpd in 1949 next year the company completed the 1 212km trans arabian pipeline tapline the longest in the world tapline linked eastern saudi arabia with the mediterranean sea sharply cutting the time and cost of oil export to europe after two years of exploration in shallow arabian gulf waters aramco discovered safaniyah field in 1951 it proved to be the world s largest offshore oilfield later in 1958 aramco s crude oil production crossed 1 million bpd by 1962 in another major milestone the crude oil output touched 5 million bpd and by 1971 the shipment of crude oil and petroleum products from the ras tanura marine terminal surpassed one billion barrels per year for the first time in 1973 the saudi government bought a 25 interest in aramco and increased it to 60 the following year in 1980 the saudi government raised its stake to 100 later the saudi arabian oil company saudi aramco was officially established a new company set up to take over all responsibilities of aramco with ali al naimi becoming its first saudi president in 1984 in the following year saudi aramco began its transformation from an oil producing and exporting company to an integrated petroleum enterprise with the creation of star enterprises in 1989 a joint venture with texaco in the united states this would evolve to become motiva initially a partnership with texaco

pakistan has to commit to a further fiscal adjustment of around 2 5 per cent of gdp along with deep rooted and wide ranging structural reforms to secure a bailout from the international monetary fund imf despite top level political interventions according to sources this adjustment will have to be supported by a further increase in electricity and gas rates as well as reining in the bleeding in public sector entities to address the quasi fiscal deficit in the system the combined adjustment over the next two years can go beyond 3 5pc of gdp over rs1 4 trillion the circular debt capping plan promised by the power division for finalisation in the first week of december 2018 is still pending the circular debt has since gone up to about rs1 64tr from about rs1 3tr at the end of september that year faced with rising inflation amid higher energy prices the government s major concern is the political and economic costs of the painful imf programme the government s drive for the recovery of arrears and reduction in system losses in both electricity and gas sectors has yet to show tangible results transmission losses in the power sector increased to 4 3pc in january from 2 6pc a few months ago while gas losses remained stagnant above 12pc gas and electricity rates were raised a couple of months ago by up to 30pc and 15pc respectively and are estimated to go further up by 30pc by june the government believed the major challenge pertained to the fresh flow of the circular debt which should come to an end over two years starting with about 20 25pc tariff adjustment in the first phase the old stock of rs800bn or so can then be addressed over the medium term the imf wants the next year s tax revenues to expand significantly to close to rs5tr from the target of about rs4 4tr this year strengthening the central bank s autonomy in line with the international best practices a market based flexible exchange rate and reduction in the debt ratio are some of the key areas of the framework that the two sides have to work out by april this year in order to make it a part of the next year s budget the two sides have to reach a staff level agreement on the pace and sequencing of policy actions on both fiscal and structural fronts that the imf mission can defend before its executive board in tough circumstances both sides have generally agreed upon the broad policy direction of about 5 6bn package except that the imf wants actions frontloaded in the first year and the government desires that the implementation be phased equally over three years already facing criticism over rising inflation amid higher energy prices the government s major concern was the political and economic costs of the painful programme it can hardly afford to have public protests like those in some european countries therefore it wanted to delay any further increase in electricity gas and petroleum rates to ensure reasonable gaps also the fund and the authorities have been negotiating an unusually difficult programme as evident from the protracted engagements since september october last year for many reasons including a not so friendly geo political situation despite a recent relative ease in tension between islamabad and washington over the dialogue with the taliban the imf management has a limited role as the decision has to be made through majority vote unlike the previous practice of gst rate adjustments an effort has already been set in motion to increase the petroleum levy on petroleum products to partially offset slippages on the revenue targets the levy on petrol and high speed diesel increased massively for this month to up to rs18 from rs10 and rs25 from rs8 per litre respectively this is despite the fact that the pti government had reversed a target of rs300bn set by the pml n government for this year to rs180bn this stems from the fact that the gst is a divisible tax that mostly goes to the provinces at the political cost of the federal government while the petroleum levy stays in the federal kitty going forward the key requirement of the fund programme is for the government to generate sufficient resources to fully finance government expenditures including social and public service delivery and the development programme except for interest payments ie the primary budget surplus that is where the role of the provinces comes into play in terms of provincial cash surpluses or devolution of responsibilities commensurate with the transfer of resources under the nfc award and shared financing needs of azad kashmir gilgit baltistan and tribal districts the so called proposal for setting aside 7pc of the gross divisible pool resources therefore finance minister asad umar led team will have to manoeuvre policy dialogue on two intertwined objectives and directions with the imf on one hand and the provinces on the other no decision can be imposed on the provinces as the nfc award has to be reached with consensus the provinces have agreed to be part of the dialogue with the imf at least in the matters of fiscal adjustments while the government has already started shifting a huge stock of borrowing from the state bank of pakistan sbp to commercial banks through successive increases in policy rates to an extent of about 450 basis points this may need further support beyond 11pc more significantly the rupee has to get close to its real effective exchange rate to come to terms with the imf there are also indications about the revival of discussions for the introduction of a universal value added tax vat to replace the gst for an integrated coverage of goods and services across the country for which the provinces will have to show consent all past efforts failed to reach a consensus on vat or even the reformed gst the federal ministries of planning and development and finance have already been advocating cost sharing with the provinces on health and education programmes such as polio income support and higher education as these subjects fall basically in the provincial jurisdiction published in dawn the business and finance weekly february 18th 2019

durable ecb governing council member francois villeroy de galhau said in a el pais newspaper interview over the weekend that the central bank will scrutinize incoming data to decide whether to hike after this summer he said the key question will be if the slowdown is temporary with a bounce back during this year or more durable for now there is resilient domestic demand in germany france and spain and that kept recession risk low even though outlook was clouded by protectionism and brexit and de galhau also noted that there was strong convergence of views within ecb about the sequencing of the next policy steps as well as the flexibility about timing ecb rehn have to wait and see how long slowdown lasts another ecb governing council member olli rehn told german newspaper handelsblatt that the most recent data point to a weakening of the economy and the reasons for the slowdown mainly lie abroad including us china trade conflicts though there were also uncertainties over brexit

that rates will be at their current level until we have sustainably reached our monetary policy goal for now wage growth had not had much impact on core inflation yet even though at the end of last year it looked as if there would be stronger momentum in inflation and we have to wait and see how long the period of weaker growth will last central bankers and growth outlook to dominate in addition to us china trade talks and brexit growth outlook and central bankers views will be the major focuses this week fed s patience turn in january meeting was much of a surprise to the markets however despite of a downgrade the median projection of federal funds rates by the end of 2019 was still at 2 9 as seen in the projections that is there could be two more rate hikes that s apparently very different from recent comments from fed officials which indicate one hike at most probably none at all so the minutes will be scrutinized for more hints on what the officials are actually thinking a number of fed officials will also speech this week including john williams richard clarida and randal quarles durable goods orders and pmis from us will also be watched for hints on growth outlook ecb will also release january monetary policy accounts at the meeting ecb turned more dovish and noted that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside that s the first

speaking at the inaugural function of insaf health card for the people of tribal district prime minister imran khan said that the country has come out from the debt trap to certain extent however the federal government has sought high interest bearing short term foreign currency loans from friendly countries including china saudi arabia and united arab emirates which raise the foreign debt liability over 100 billion this what the independent economists had already projected early last year for the fy 19 in addition to the foreign loans domestic borrowing of rs rs 2 6 trillion has been made by way of printing currency note which is the more irrational method of deficit for financing to meet the rising current expenditure acquisition of imf loan package is also on cards building a premise on the bilateral foreign economic assistance finance minister asad umer gave the impression that now international monetary fund imf will not impose tough conditions with its loan package to be agreed for pakistan and this will be the last bail out package which be availed from this international donor this was a sweeping statement ignoring the ground realities with regard the carry over huge foreign debt liabilities and persistent current account deficit during the next few years a renowned economist and member of prime minister s economic advisory council dr ashfaq ahmad khan disagreed to this sort of wishful thinking and said that imf conditions had never been soft whether the loan package was small or big he elaborated that during his service in the ministry of finances he was dealing with imf loans for 16 years during which the conditions we never soft he is very right because beggars are no choosers as a drastic departure from the established practice of the past this time the prime minister himself met with the imf managing director christina laggard on the sideline of world economic summit held in dubai previously finance minister and high official of the finance ministry used to hold the talks with the global lender the opposition leaders have criticised the meeting of the prime minister with the imf md as against the dignity and prestige of a sovereign country however every pakistani knows that the financial mismanagement and corrupt practices of the previous two governments of ppp and pml n pushed the country to the ventilator of imf confirming the contention of dr ashfaq ahmad khan about tough condition of washington based international lending agency petroleum minister ghulam sarwar while talking to media minced no words and categorically said that imf is exerting pressure for further increase in gas tariff if the government has decided to swallow the bitter pill of tough conditions attached with the imf loan package which is essential instrument for seeking the much needed project loans from the world bank and the asian development bank then the government would have no other choice but to increase the gas and power tariff central purchasing agency has moved a proposal rs 1 93 per unit hike in electricity tariff to the national electric power regulatory authority nepra last month nepra has notified rs 0 57 per unit increase in the power tariff domestic gas is relatively cheaper input for electricity generation as compared with luxury of generating electricity from the expensive diesel and furnace oil based thermal power generation the per unit production cost of electricity from domestic gas is rs 5 as compared with the production cost of rs 20 for diesel and rs 14 for the furnace the unaffordable luxury of thermal power generation from diesel and furnace oil along with 40 percent idle capacity charges was slapped on the poor people of the country by second benazir bhutto government acceptance of imf condition of hiking the gas tariff will have a multiplier effect on the cost of production in the manufacturing and energy sectors further depressing the growth of the economy by jacking up inflation on the one hand and intensifying the recession cycle as the next imf programme is frontloaded and government has to fulfill the agreed condition before loans are released then the conditions pertaining to increase revenue generation for direct taxes should be implemented first

geneva 6 feb ips yilmaz akyuz at a time when the world economy is seen poised for yet another financial turmoil there is a widespread recognition that emerging economies emes are particularly vulnerable because of their deepened integration into the global financial system what is less appreciated is the implication of financial globalization and integration for external wealth distribution between emerging and advanced economies and resource transfers from the former to the latter this is the subject matter of a new study by this author on external balance balance end of year statement of a company s assets what the company possesses and liabilities what it owes in other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used and the liabilities about the origins of those funds sheets of emerging economies focussing on nine g 20 emes argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico russia south africa and turkey and four major advanced economies the us japan germany and the uk the new millennium has seen a rapid increase in gross external assets and liabilities liabilities the part of the balance sheet that comprises the resources available to a company equity provided by the partners provisions for risks and charges debts of emes both as a result of ultra easy monetary policy in major advanced economies aes and capital account liberalization in emes a process of deepened integration described as playing with fire almost 90 per cent of outstanding external assets and liabilities of g 20 emes have been accumulated since the turn of the century although debtor creditor relations and foreign direct investment fdi within the global south have been growing rapidly a very large proportion of gross external assets and liabilities of emes are still with aes this is true not only for financial assets and liabilities but also for fdi even in china less than 20 per cent of the stock of outward fdi are in other emes while foreign investment and lending in emes have reached unprecedented levels even emes with current account deficits have been able to accumulate large amounts of gross external assets because inflows of capital have often exceeded what is needed to finance deficits in fact with the exception of china and russia which have run current account surpluses since 2000 the entire foreign assets accumulation in g20 g20 the group of twenty g20 or g 20 is a group made up of nineteen countries and the european union whose ministers central bank directors and heads of state meet regularly it was created in 1999 after the series of financial crises in the 1990s its aim is to encourage international consultation on the principle of broadening dialogue in keeping with the growing economic importance of a certain number of countries its members are argentina australia brazil canada china france germany italy india indonesia japan mexico russia saudi arabia south africa south korea turkey usa uk and the european union represented by the presidents of the council and of the european central bank emes has relied on borrowed money resulting in significant leverage leverage this is the ratio between funds borrowed for investment and the personal funds or equity that backs them up a company may have borrowed much more than its capitalized value in which case it is said to be highly leveraged the more highly a company is leveraged the higher the risk associated with lending to the company but higher also are the possible profits that it may realise as compared with its own value in external balance sheets there are also significant changes in the structure of external balance sheets of emes the share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of equities fdi plus portfolio equity equity the capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders not to be confused with hard capital or unsecured debt in total external liabilities increased and the share of debt declined as governments sought to shift from debt to equities by opening up equity markets and liberalizing fdi regimes on grounds that equity financing is more stable and less risky than debt the share of equities in gross external assets also increased but not as fast as in liabilities consequently the net equity position external equity assets minus liabilities of g20 emes taken together which was already negative at the beginning of the century deteriorated further the share of international reserves in total external assets increased rapidly as countries sought to build self insurance against speculative attacks often with borrowed money the share of local currency in external sovereign debt sovereign debt government debts or debts guaranteed by the government increased as bond bond a bond is a stake in a debt issued by a company or governmental body the holder of the bond the creditor is entitled to interest and reimbursement of the principal if the company is listed the holder can also sell the bond on a stock exchange markets have been opened to foreigners to pass the currency risk but the corporate sector has come to account for a growing part of external debt of emes by increasingly borrowing in international markets in dollars to benefit from lower rates these changes in the size and composition of external balance sheets of emes have not only generated new channels of transmission of external financial shocks discussed in playing with fire but also resulted in significant transfer of resources from emes to aes first they have rendered the value of their existing stocks of external assets and liabilities more susceptible to changes in global financial conditions notably asset asset something belonging to an individual or a business that has value or the power to earn money ft the opposite of assets are liabilities that is the part of the balance sheet reflecting a company s resources the capital contributed by the partners provisions for contingencies and charges as well as the outstanding debts prices and exchange rates leading to capital gains and losses and altering their net foreign asset positions nfap or net external wealth that is the difference between gross external assets and liabilities over the short term these valuation changes can be much more important than current account balances in the movement of nfap particularly at times of severe instability as was seen during 2008 09 since foreign assets and liabilities of emes are mainly with aes these gains and losses entail redistribution of external wealth between the global south and the north indeed there is a strong negative correlation between year to year changes in net external wealth of nine g20 emes and four major aes in the new millennium and a large proportion of such changes is accounted for by capital gains and losses rather than current account balances in the long term current account remains a main determinant of net external wealth of nations but capital gains and losses resulting from valuation changes can also be important since the beginning of the century the nfap of most g 20 emes deteriorated because of sustained current account deficits the nfap of two surplus emes china and russia improved but not as much as their cumulative current account surpluses because they both suffered large amounts of capital losses on their outstanding external assets and liabilities for instance china had a cumulative current account surplus of over 3 trillion during 2000 2016 but its net external wealth increased by only 1 6 trillion by contrast the us had a cumulative current account deficit over 8 trillion during the same period but its net external debt deteriorated by less than 7 trillion because of capital gains even though some smaller g 20 emes also had capital gains the nine emes taken together suffered capital losses in the order of 1 9 trillion during 2000 2016 while the four aes enjoyed capitals gains over 1 6 trillion second with the expansion of gross foreign assets and liabilities international investment income receipts and payments have gained added importance in the current account generally emes are red in net international investment income not only because their external liabilities exceed assets but also because the rate of return on their foreign assets falls short of the rate of return on their foreign liabilities their liabilities are concentrated in high yielding equities while a large proportion of their assets consists of low yielding reserve assets for this reason even some emes with positive net external wealth positions such as china and russia have deficits in net international investment income furthermore all emes including china earn lower return on their outward fdi than they pay on inward fdi they also pay more on their external debt liabilities in risk premia than they receive on their external debt assets including reserves us treasuries other bonds or deposits abroad the shift to domestic currency debt by governments of emes has widened the return gap between debt liabilities and assets because the exchange rate risk assumed by foreign investors needs to be compensated by contrast the return differential between external assets and liabilities is positive for all four major aes the us registers the highest positive return differential and runs a surplus on its international investment income balance despite having a negative net external wealth in the order of some 25 per cent of its gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another the return on its outward fdi is higher than in all other countries and exceeds by a large margin the return it pays on its inward fdi as the country issuing the dominant reserve currency the us also earns higher return on its external debt assets than it pays on its external debt liabilities mainly treasuries thereby enjoying what is commonly known as exorbitant privilege the nine g 20 emes taken together have been transferring around 2 7 per cent of their combined gdp per year in the new millennium mainly to aes as a result of the negative return gap between their foreign assets and liabilities and capital losses resulting from changes in asset prices and exchange rates these resource costs are incurred in large part because emes favour a particular structure of external balance sheets highly liquid low yielding assets less liquid high yielding liabilities that is believed to be more resilient to external financial shocks this means that in effect emes are transferring large sums of resources to aes in order to protect themselves against the shocks created mainly by policies of the very same countries this is underpinned by an international reserves system that allows a handful of reserve issuing countries notably the us to constantly extract resources from the rest of the world on the other hand it is not clear if emes can adequately protect themselves against shocks when capital can move freely judicious use of capital account measures can secure reasonable protection while avoiding such costs for instance one would not need to issue high yielding liabilities to acquire large stocks of low yielding reserves assets as self insurance if inflows of fickle capital are effectively controlled resource transfers from the south to the north through financial channels will continue unabated as long as capital flows remain unrestricted the international reserves system favours a handful of rich countries which can also pursue self seeking policies without regard to their global repercussions
here s my summary of the key events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news of chinese uncertainty roiling commodity markets a brutal new year selloff in oil markets deepened overnight with prices plunging as much as 5 to new 12 year lows as more ructions in the chinese stock market threatened to knock crude into the us 20s in fact chinese shares fell to their lowest level since september yesterday with the benchmark shanghai composite index losing 5 3 extending last week s near 10 loss the shenzhen market lost more than 6 2 losses are spilling over to other markets however the recent small fall off in global demand for air freight may be bottoming out with cargo volumes growing month on month in november that s what the international air transport association reported overnight air cargo volumes measured in freight tonne kilometers were down 1 2 in november 2015 compared to november 2014 on a seasonally adjusted basis total cargo volumes however rose compared to october 2015 and were higher than the recent low point in august this activity paints a completely different picture to what is happening to international trade than the shipping measures that were used in the 1990s demand for ships is down but demand for freight aircraft remains high world trade issues will probably be focused on auckland in early february for the formal signing of the trans pacific partnership trade deal a recent world bank study reported in the afr shows that generally rich countries won t benefit as much as developing countries except for new zealand who stands out as a clear winner another stark conclusion those in benefit much more than those who have not joined the us fed has reported its labor market conditions index lmci at 2 9 in december up from 2 7 in november and far above economists expectations for a reading of 0 4 it can be a very profitable business being a regulator data out overnight shows that the us fed paid a record us 117 bln dividends to the us treasury that s a lot given the federal deficit is us 440 bln and declining back in new york the ust 10yr yield benchmark has risen in mid day trading today and is now at 2 18 local swap rates fell sharply following the wall street lead yesterday so may well rise on today s indications and crude oil is still falling and is now just over us 31 50 barrel sub 30 barrel now looks inevitable given supply will stay high it is softer chinese demand and the stronger us dollar that are driving this market and the gold price continues to slip and is now at us 1 098 oz much of this is also just an exchange rate effect from the rising us dollar it s been a variable night for the kiwi dollar but it starts today at similar levels to this time yesterday it is now at 65 5 us now at 93 7 au and at 60 2 euro cents the twi 5 is pretty much unchanged at 71 if you want to catch up with all the local changes on friday we have an update here the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here
after the synchronised global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronised global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions an early rally to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets us and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate hikes and about chinese and us growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the us has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are now pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the us labour market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above 2 per cent fears of at least two more rate hikes this year would return possibly shocking markets and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn will revive concerns about us growth slowdown in chinese growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilisation of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hamper global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time will europe s slowing growth get worse fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the united kingdom and the european union alike us president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not just in germany finally much will depend on how euroskeptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy dysfunction in the us fifth america s dysfunctional domestic politics could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction can t be ruled out lower oil prices seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices decent but mediocre year ahead though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy wasn t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialize the synchronised slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and sharp market downturn in 2020 nouriel roubini is ceo of roubini macro associates and professor of economics at the stern school of business new york

evidence of two things first that less mature clean energy markets are in the ascendency and second that the argentine government s plan to produce 20 of electricity from renewable sources by 2025 compared with just 2 at present is working argentina is replete with renewable resources constant sunshine in the remote northwest steady winds in southern patagonia and hydropower and biomass fed by

generation according to the argentine solar energy atlas more than half of the national territory receives annual average sunlight of more than 3 5kwh per square metre the solar and wind resources combined show a development potential for the immediate future particularly limited by the current capacity of the transmission networks which will have to be expanded to face the higher demand of energy says marcelo iezzi associate partner in sustainability pwc argentina apart from the wind and solar energies mentioned argentina also has favourable conditions for the development of biogas biomass biofuel and small water projects however given the growth of the first two and their better conditions for technological offers and locations for their installation both the authorities and the private sector focus their activities and attention on them this is borne out by the results of argentina s inaugural renewable energy auction known as renovar renovate in spanish which took place at the end of 2016 a total of 22 wind projects were awarded for 1 473mw of power as well as 24 solar pv projects for 916mw however the country is limited by the current capacity of its transmission networks as well as an historical focus on run of the river power generation facilities and fossil fuel electricity generation forward thinking the renovar auction programme what argentina lacked until recently was the political will to push through legislation required to create a private sector energy market aimed at diversifying the country s energy mix other priorities include boosting its energy security by easing its reliance on imported fossil fuels from which 60 of argentina s electricity is still generated and reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions to 37 by 2030 in line with its united nations nationally determined contributions ndc goal this period of relative stasis appeared to be coming to an end in 2017 when the argentine administration under president mauricio macri declared 2017 the year of renewable energy in fact the seeds of argentina s clean energy revolution were sown in 2015 when the government announced a new legal framework for renewable energy a renewable energy fund foder backed by a 480m guarantee from the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd and fiscal incentives and competitive transparent market rules aimed at attracting foreign investment renovar was launched a year later renewable energy companies were invited to bid for investment projects publically stating the price at which they are willing to sell their capacity the contracts awarded by cammesa the company that manages argentina s electricity wholesale market take the form of long term power purchase agreements ppas in us dollars allowing companies to ensure their sales without exposing themselves to potential devaluations of the peso the first bidding round was an unqualified success the total amount of offers received stood at 6 200mw nearly two thirds of them from local investors more than six times the requested capacity current installed capacity for the generation of energy in argentina is approximately 31 000mw meaning the allocations altogether represent an almost 8 increase of that capacity this is good news for both the government and consumers in argentina where in recent years demand for electricity has outstripped growth in installed generation capacity the auction conveyed a success beyond the already mentioned historical difficulties to accompany the demand growth rate with new investments in electricity generation assets explains carlos fernandez landa deals partner at pwc españa in this regard deploying the new renewable capacity awarded at the auction is the first milestone in the development of an energy policy that can combine the three major guidelines in renewable energies security of supply economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability private investment a new renewable model for argentina this policy leverages private sector investment and eschews public debt creating a new renewable energy market characterised by innovation transparency and competitive electricity pricing in october 2018 cammesa announced that it had signed contracts with three projects the la pirka ullum x and verano capital solar one pv schemes each with an installed capacity of 100mw selected in round two of the renovar renewable energy auction programme in october 2017 the following month argentina launched the third round of public auctions with wind and solar again accounting for the majority of the 400mw of new installed capacity on offer successful bidders will be revealed on 17 may and ppas will be signed between 20 may and 8 november 2019 the potential economic and environmental benefits are huge pwc reports that investment in renewables in latin america exceeded 16bn in 2015 argentina aims to attract around 35bn in investments in energy in the coming years about half of that for renewable power while renovar is expected to reduce ghg emissions by 79 64 million tonnes mt of co 2 over 20 years or 4mt of co 2 per year historically argentina may have lagged behind its neighbours when it comes to renewable energy but policy changes private foreign investment and cheaper technologies mean it may not be playing catch up for much longer
once too high imports are now tumbling once battered exports are crawling up the change is visible the trade deficit is down remittances are doing better hopes for a huge foreign investment are about to start materialising follow up events of saudi crown prince mohammad bin salman s visit to islamabad will show how things are cool on the external front or so are we being told again and again but can the growth rate of exports make a real impact on the external account or are volumetric gains even at twice that rate enough to contain the trade deficit is the current rate of decline in imports sustainable and if so how what about the concentration of home remittances in a few host countries of the pakistani diaspora what happens when economic conditions of the host countries change for worse is it ok to continue counting on remittances even if it means a brain drain from the homeland what s the social cost of overreliance on remittances can pakistan afford to continue relying on remittances more than exports these are some valid questions that need to be probed from a long term perspective the rupee devaluation produced inflation and tighter interest rates continue to make the industrial output costlier hopefully the pti government rejoicing at a small gain in exports and continuation of big gains in home remittances will soon evaluate their true significance and do more to boost exports and sustain the rising remittances trend in seven months of this fiscal year exports grew to 13 23 billion from 12 94bn a gain of 290 million or 2 24 per cent and that too with the help of a straight 14pc rupee depreciation during this period our ministry of commerce issued a press release to celebrate this achievement that s ok but perhaps the ministry would do better to find out why exports fetched only 290m more on an annual basis despite such a big fall in the rupee s value our imports tumbled to 32 5bn in july jan from 34 26bn a year ago creating foreign exchange savings of 1 77bn in seven months mainly because of this substantial fall in imports rather than growth in export earnings the merchandise trade deficit fell to 19 26bn from 21 32bn in the year ago period this 2 06bn decline in the trade deficit is important but it came at the cost of 14pc rupee devaluation tighter interest rates and upward revisions in import duties of hundreds of items the rupee devaluation produced inflation and tighter interest rates continue to make the industrial output costlier so this hard earned contraction in the trade deficit ought to be sustained now the government has once again started rationalising the import tariff to keep the cost of industrial raw materials low finance ministry officials claim that the exercise will facilitate exports while keeping the check on imports of luxury consumer items intact only future movements in merchandise trade will expose or confirm their claims an intriguing aspect of our external economy is that foreign exchange dispatches from overseas pakistanis are growing fast narrowing the gap between home remittances and exports against total exports of 13 23bn in july jan remittances during this period totalled 12 77bn with an annualised growth rate of 12 2pc compared with exports growth of just 2 24pc if both sources of foreign exchange earnings continue to grow at the same rate in coming months remittances and exports will be on a par at the end of this fiscal year such a situation will throw up lots of questions for politicians to answer and lots of challenges for economic policymakers to handle from the policymaking angle it is time to remove structural flaws in exports as opposed to eliminating exchange rate and tariff limitations constant supply of affordable energy ease of doing business minimum political uncertainty speedy reforms in the agriculture and services sector and elimination of red tape from decision making processes and platforms are some of the things our export sector keeps craving for for sustaining a double digit increase in remittances the most important things is to ensure supply of semi skilled skilled and professional workforce to global markets and that too without creating a human resource gap in the domestic economy that s not an easy task gains in remittances due to better economic conditions in host countries like the united states or united kingdom or as a result of deeper penetration of unskilled and semi skilled workforce in gulf nations and malaysia are prone to sudden changes so far this fiscal year pakistan has received 7bn foreign exchange support from china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to augment its foreign exchange reserves despite that the central bank s reserves currently stand around 8 2bn equal to less than two months of imports these foreign funds have been placed with the central bank and as such do not constitute the government s external debt but by whatever name you call them they are the foreign exchange liabilities of the state and also carry a financial price in addition to their huge socio political costs further placements are in the pipeline and the picture may become clearer after the saudi crown prince wraps up his visit to pakistan how exactly the nation will pay the price of the accumulation of more and more foreign exchange liabilities will continue to unfold in coming years and how our external sector will be affected by the servicing of these foreign exchange liabilities in addition to regular external debt servicing is a question that is sure to remain a source of worry for people in power already pakistan spends roughly 1 5bn on external debt servicing on a quarterly basis that amount itself is going to grow rapidly when the country begins external debt servicing related to the funds received under the cpec so rejoicing at an uptick in exports or double digit growth in remittances can prove short lived and external sector weaknesses may continue to haunt us for quite some time much depends on how quickly we start receiving the promised thick flows of foreign investment from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in the first half of this fiscal year foreign direct investment totalled just 1 32bn will this amount double or triple by the end of the year and by the way how will that affect the volumes of the repatriation of profits and dividends on foreign investment in the first half of 2018 19 1 2bn flew out of pakistan under this head of which 1bn was on account of profits and dividends on foreign direct investment alone

first a review of last week s events eur usd recall that the expert community was not able to form a more or less definite opinion on the movement of this pair last week this was due to the lack of clarity on both brexit and the us china negotiations in addition analysts were waiting for the release of data on gdp in germany and the eu as well as inflation and retail sales in the us and if europe showed an expected growth of 1 2 and germany rose by 0 2 from 0 2 to 0 0 the data from the usa caused a strong alarm in the market retail sales fell by 1 2 the maximum value in 10 years as a result the dollar index suspended growth and moved away from two month highs the dollar has also stopped growing to the european currency however if we sum up the results of the whole five day week the victory nevertheless remained with the american having started from the level of 1 1320 the pair finished the week at the level of 1 1295 gbp usd pound is falling for the third week in a row the problems associated with brexit have been supplemented by poor macroeconomic indicators indicating a slowdown in the country s economy the gdp growth has declined compared to the previous quarter from 0 6 to 0 2 and the consumer price index fell by 0 3 as a result the pair recorded a weekly minimum at 1 2770 on thursday then the statistics on the us economy came out and turned the trend from south to north as a result the british pound was able to win back 115 points from the dollar and complete the week at 1 2885 usd jpy the japanese currency was losing ground throughout the first half of the week reaching the value of 111 12 yen per dollar but then against the background of the fall in the stock market due to the weak economic data from the united states and the us china talks that once again reached a deadlock the pair made a sharp reversal increased appetites for risk free investments allowed the quotes to lower to the level of 110 25 after which a correction followed and the pair froze at 110 45 cryptocurrencies last week answering the question of whether the bitcoin jerk to the height of 3 800 could be considered a harbinger of a storm we noticed that the pair had just returned to the consolidation line or pivot point along which it has been moving for 11 weeks beginning in late november 2018 and we were right the consolidation continued and the pair kept in a very narrow side corridor of 3 630 3 750 for the whole already the 12th week the total capitalization of the crypto market has also remained almost unchanged if it was at the level of 121 78 billion on friday february 9 after seven days it was equal to 120 16 billion as for the top altcoins in contrast to the reference cryptocurrency they showed a somewhat greater volatility so for example the fluctuations range of litecoin ltc usd was about 15 and of ripple xrp usd about 7 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd not the rosiest economic situation in europe is on one side of the scale on the other is the collapse of stock indices and trade wars in the united states jp morgan and macroeconomic advisers lower their forecasts for the us gdp growth and bofa merrill lynch and bloomberg raise their forecasts for the eurozone in their opinion the zero growth of germany s gdp is a temporary factor and in the case of the soft brexit and improvements in the chinese economy germany together with the rest of europe will turn to sustainable economic growth all this together with the desire of the fed to take a pause in monetary tightening gives the market a reason to believe that the measures of the regulator are late the recession in the us is not far off and the balance will swing to europe in this case the pressure on the dollar will increase but this is for the future in the meantime 70

decrease to the level of 3 000 the remaining 35 of analysts have an opposite point of view expecting the pair to be able at least for a while to rise to the level of 4 000

columns paul krugman u s political discussion has been dominated by the issue of donald trump s wall an issue on which trump s irrationality keeps surprising even his critics so i don t imagine that many people have heard about trump s nomination of david malpass currently an undersecretary at the treasury department to lead the world bank but it s a story worth following for one thing while the u s traditionally gets to choose the world bank s president europe gets the international monetary fund there will be a lot of opposition to malpass who has a history of being hostile to international institutions furthermore the malpass nomination highlights the remarkable character of trump s economic appointments remarkable in what way well remarkably bad every economist yours truly very much included gets it wrong sometimes but trump only seems to choose men who have been wrong about everything beyond that however what s remarkable is the extent to which this president consistently chooses economists whose ideology is at odds with his own professed views on policy these days at least trump is an easy money guy who wants the fed to keep interest rates low but he keeps appointing deflationists men who opposed any attempt to rescue the economy from the financial crisis who bitterly attacked the fed for keeping rates low and demanded tight money even when we had very high unemployment why does he do this i ll get there in a minute first let s talk about who s on the trump team at the top of the list is larry kudlow director of the national economic council he has quite a track record as one commentator put it he has elevated flamboyant wrongness into a form of performance art kudlow may be best known for his unflagging faith in the teeth of the evidence in the magic of tax cuts as well as his dismissal of bubbleheads who predicted a housing crash less known is his 2008 praise for bush officials for having the courage not to bail out lehman bros just hours after his encomiums lehman s fall had plunged the whole world into financial meltdown kevin hassett chairman of the council of economic advisers is another bubble denier although his most famous prediction was in his 1999 book dow 36 000 which adjusted for inflation would mean roughly dow 55 000 today more relevant to current policy hassett was among those who kept predicting wrongly that ben bernanke s efforts to fight unemployment would cause runaway inflation and then there s malpass also both a bubble denier and a bernanke basher much press commentary has noted his 2007 insistence as chief economist at bear stearns that there was no reason to be worried about the financial system a few months later his own firm imploded but i think his most revealing piece of commentary was a 2011 screed against low interest rates and what he considered a weak dollar policy a low rate policy he declared hurts the economy because it discourages thrift while the weak dollar was bad for confidence or something this was really bad economics at the time america had 9 percent unemployment entirely because of inadequate private spending to the extent that low interest rates were discouraging thrift and making people spend rather than save that would have been a good thing not a problem and malpass argument about the dollar was just incoherent what s really striking however is that the policies malpass attacked were precisely the policies trump now demands low rates and a weaker dollar so why would trump want to promote him and people like him here s how i understand it the first thing trump looks for in an appointee is someone who shares his values above all his absolute lack of compassion for those less fortunate than himself and if you want an economic official who doesn t care about the poor or the unlucky you must perforce go for a right winger but trump also has another criterion he wants people who will be personally dependent on him who don t have any kind of professional reputation to defend and therefore won t take a stand on principle that is he only wants hacks and here s the thing right wing hack economists are with hardly any exceptions hard money hyperinflation is around the corner types so trump ends up with officials whose past views are diametrically opposed to what he says now does this mean that the men he has chosen will stand in the way of his policies no not at all they are hacks after all and will tell trump whatever he wants to hear but it does mean that trumpian economic policy is being made by men who almost by definition don t know what they re doing to have gotten their jobs they not only had to have track records of talking nonsense but to have suddenly started talking completely different nonsense reversing their long held positions to curry favor with the very stable genius so what will happen if and when this economic team has to deal with real problems like a global slump somehow i m not optimistic paul krugman is a columnist for the new york times in 2008 he received the nobel prize in economic sciences
how did things turn so bad for zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa guest column stephen chan how did things turn so bad for zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa he won the disputed july 30 2018 elections but even before the results were officially announced protesters were being shot in the street with the security forces laying into the protesters in front of the world s press and international election observers if those observers were contemplating a reluctant and muted endorsement of the results then the shootings served to ensure that endorsement was not forthcoming riot police armed with tear gas also threatened to storm the bronte hotel where many observers were staying to prevent a press conference by the leader of the opposition nelson chamisa i witnessed this as i was staying at the very same hotel once again their threatening posture was filmed and broadcast in real time and many observers senior figures in their own countries standing near me were pushed about by the security forces as was i and so mnangagwa s mantra of zimbabwe being open for business began to wilt away right from the outset but more was to come in january 2019 riots broke out to protest a huge hike in the price of fuel mnangagwa announced the price rise before leaving the country to visit eastern europe to seek investment and address the world economic forum event in davos it was as if he was unaware of the fury a doubling in petrol costs would trigger with former defence chief general constantine chiwenga in charge as acting president the protesters were met with a furious militarised response the response was so radical that police officials secretly showed the guardian journalist jason burke documents directly implicating the military government claims that those involved in the shootings and beatings were gangsters in stolen uniforms seem highly unlikely mnangagwa hurried back without making it to davos and promptly promised that those who had killed beaten and raped citizens would be punished but he must know that to do so he will have to take on chiwenga and many zimbabweans are convinced that chiwenga a hard military man rumoured to have the army behind him and never convincing in a civilian suit seeks the presidency for himself he would likely relish a confrontation with mnangagwa as a prelude to deposing him or forcing him to resign what next three things are clear as zimbabwe enters what looks set to be a troubled 2019 first there is a divided leadership whether rumours of palace coups are real or not this is partly because no one knows how to lead zimbabwe out of its economic mess and as things become more chaotic many in the ruling zanu pf party think there is no choice but to brazen out the economic meltdown by ruthlessly squashing any political protest as it is chiwenga who is now receiving medical treatment in india probably can t move against mnangagwa while cyril ramaphosa remains president of neighbouring south africa ramaphosa who recently called for sanctions to be lifted on zimbabwe has made it very clear behind the scenes that he will not tolerate a coup and the meagre liquidity which does seep into zimbabwe comes in large part from south africa squeezing chiwenga dry by economic means is well within ramaphosa s capacity mnangagwa tough choices but while mnangagwa and chiwenga are unwilling or unable to move against each other zimbabwe is left with a divided government a stalemate that means even less agreed action on the economy second the president is genuinely unable to gauge the mood of the people or to understand how deeply they are affected by economic malfunction while they watch the financial malpractice of so many in the ruling elite it is as if the material comforts of protected suburbs such as harare s borrowdale brook insulate the ruling oligarchic elite from any sense of what deprivation means third the much touted technocratic finance minister mthuli ncube is out of his depth faced with an informal money market where government bond notes were rapidly losing value against the united states dollar and where there was a huge shortage of us small business operators in zimbabwe turned to electronic cellphone transactions establishing a kind of rough and ready but robust virtual economy but ncube s decision to tax these electronic transactions immediately knocked the confidence out of that form of exchange the textbook says you must broaden the tax base and the new tax did just that but it was also naïve in the extreme as it broke the back of any vibrancy left in the zimbabwean street level urban economy fuelling the fire ncube s naivety was again seen in the fuel price hike there is no fuel because the country has insufficient foreign exchange to import the petrol needed again the textbook says that when supply fails to equal demand you must do one of two things either increase supply which is impossible in zimbabwe or dampen demand the price rise sought to achieve the latter but it brought the possibility of economic life for a huge number of ordinary people to a standstill the price of transport into town to work to look for work or to sell or buy whatever is available in the street markets became prohibitive one price rise has therefore caused a multiplicity of damaging consequences ncube now proposes a return to a national currency within a year rather than future reliance on the us this will almost certainly mean another wave of hyperinflation the very reason why the previous national currency was abandoned and the us adopted the greatest mistake of the former president robert mugabe years was a refusal to take seriously the simple truth that production leads to exports and exports earn foreign exchange zimbabwe has become a consumer society led by the political oligarchs in which the cost of imports far exceeds the returns from exports production has been so undervalued and so poorly invested in that it costs more to produce something as basic as a bottle of cooking oil than it does to import it from south africa ncube s first budget as minister was woefully short of meaningful incentives to encourage production and deal with this problem and so zimbabwe is held back by three key things a quarrel at the top that means government is too preoccupied and divided to focus on proper planning and economic management lashing out at its own people instead a disastrous inability to feel the popular pulse with the ruling oligarchs now living in a hermetically sealed world of their own and the ongoing economic naivety of those who should be managing the nation s finances mugabe financed zimbabwe with massive borrowing but no one will now lend to zimbabwe the international monetary fund imf wants its loans repaid china is waiting for some sense of fiscal responsibility to return and south africa will not give support to allow the purchase of fuel since it also is owed much money by zimbabwe indeed even if mnangagwa does move to meet imf conditions it will mean years of even greater austerity for zimbabweans sadly there will be no happy ending for zimbabwe in 2019 the

advertisment please subscribe if you enjoy the video jamie dimon and bitcoin jp morgan s jamie dimon is well known for his hatred of bitcoin and love for the blockchain it is understandable that he does not really have any clue what bitcoin was created for or where its inherent value comes from in a clip from 2017 at the institute of international finance seen here jamie dimon was cautioning people saying bitcoin will one day hurt them that bitcoin has no value that blockchain is amazing and he loved it its really odd that a man would have such a hate for bitcoin and it was also clear that he did not understand the cash he values so highly loses 2 3 per year from inflation inflation of currencies to put that last statement into perspective the usd loses between 2 3 cents of inherent value each year this means if you leave money in the bank the last 5 years your 1 usd from 5 years ago is now worth only 90 yes that actually is true and how inflation works but with bitcoin if you had bought a dollar in 2013 at say around 100 btc your 1 of the btc today would be worth over 35usd today this is because bitcoin s price is based on supply and demand economics and it is deflationary deflationary currencies unlike inflationary ones cannot print an unlimited supply which is actually what causes inflation if you have 100 usd in circulation and print off more that 100usd actually loses value this is why so many people say things like the federal reserve needs to end it is because the printing of the usd has since its inception caused the currency to lose approximately 95 of its original value and decoupling from gold made the inflation more like hyper inflation without anyone noticing when i was a child the same chocolate bar that now is 2 usd was 0 50 and i am only 33 years old so in around 25 years the inflation has caused that chocolate bar to increase 4x in price now why is this an issue lets look at things like minimum wage what we see is that has not even come close to rising as much as inflation this actually causes the rich poor gap to increase as it becomes hard and harder for the average citizens to survive when we look at jamie dimon the reason he does not care is because he is the 1 or the 0 01 so to him inflation does not affect anything people at that level of society can afford inflation because they have money to invest impact on the average family lets look at the normal family and how inflation affects them first things cost more actually everything costs more education insurance food water heating electricity gas and the list can go on and on if your income does not match the inflation in society each year you are at a company you actually are making less the average family used to have more of a nest egg to invest but with the global financial crisis of 2008 most have not recovered and sorry to say it but the markets look ripe to drop hard again in 2019 2020 if we do have another recession or worse a global financial crisis we will see people start to flock towards bitcoin as the government will quantitatively ease and print off billions doing so will not really help long term and end up with more debt in society and honestly for many the struggle is real especially those in the united states and we have seen this time and time again jpm coin and stablecoins to wrap this all into the jpm coin and stablecoins in general they are a short term solution for now they let us store our value pegged to the usd and potentially in jpm coins case let the banks transfer usd to each other the inherent problems around fiat currencies is that they are losing value constantly and are backed by nothing but a government stablecoins for now let us hold the usd value of our cryptocurrencies and are a good hedge in the volatile market what we all need to understand here is fiat currencies like venezuelan bolivars and the argentine peso have been far more volatile and hyper inflation has hit them hard the thing everyone is missing is when this eventually hits the usd and it already is showing it has on an economic scale what will everyone turn to with deflationary currencies the solution is already here for example btc has 21 million coins that will ever make it into circulation at the time of this article there are 17 542 112 btc with approximately 4m lost forever as demand for btc grows as it has in venezuela brazil argentina and turkey it will be a greater store of value it will actually increase in price as you cannot make more and this is why john mcafee tom lee and tim draper amongst others have put such a huge value per coin in the future of 150 000 to 1 million usd we all need to realize is stablecoins are not the future they aren t the solution when the usd does meet its fate of hyper inflation as other currencies have we will see cryptos like bitcoin be the the world standard jpm and usdt won t matter when the usd is similar to bolivars and argentine pesos and this is what the future looks like we cannot put a time on when this will happen but when it does it is likely bitcoin will be seen as a world currency bitcoin will back all currencies someday and this is why stablecoins are just a bandaid solution for the short term sorry jpm coin usdt usdc etc you are only a for the short term it is time to see why deflationary currencies are the future where you can

illinois state spending has grown nearly 50 faster than taxpayer incomes a spending cap proposal filed by state sen tom cullerton d villa park would ensure growth in government spending doesn t exceed taxpayers ability to pay for it illinois is in dire fiscal straits for a simple reason the state perpetually spends more than it takes in illinois has not had a balanced budget since 2001 despite the fact that the state constitution requires it one long term solution to illinois budget woes smart spending growth state sen tom cullerton d villa park introduced a spending cap constitutional amendment feb 15 that would tie growth in state government spending to growth in illinois economy that means illinoisans can rest assured they re getting a state government they can afford a crucial first step toward restoring confidence for families and business alike a similar proposal garnered bipartisan support last year state spending outruns illinois incomes illinois lawmakers have been on a spending spree state spending per capita grew 48 percent faster than illinoisans personal income per capita from 2007 to 2017 and without reforms such as cullerton s there s no sign it will slow down anytime soon state spending growth outpaced personal income growth across illinois by an average of 48 percent between 2007 and 2017 illinoisans personal incomes grew at an average annual rate of 2 52 percent while state spending grew by 3 72 percent annually in some areas of illinois such as the decatur metropolitan statistical area where annual incomes grew by 2 19 percent annually per capita state spending growth outpaced per capita personal income growth by 70 percent per year from 2007 2017 illinois is already facing a 2 8 billion deficit for fiscal year 2020 which is projected to swell to 3 4 billion in fiscal year 2021 gov j b pritzker s campaign promises carry a tab of 13 billion to 18 billion in additional annual expenses unrestrained growth in state government spending injects uncertainty into the lives of illinoisans that s because lawmakers can do only one of two things when government spending outpaces growth in the state s economy raise taxes or mortgage the incomes of future generations by borrowing money the threat of future tax hikes makes it more difficult for families to plan their futures in the land of lincoln increasingly they re planning those futures in other states illinois needs a mechanism to ensure lawmakers spend at a level taxpayers can afford years of reckless spending one gimmick springfield politicians have used to balance the budget is not appropriating funds to pay their bills the state s backlog of unpaid bills alone reached 16 billion toward the end of 2017 before the state borrowed more money to pay them down to 8 billion illinoisans may have expected that additional revenues from the largest permanent income tax hike in state history in 2017 would have led to a balanced budget but shortly after the general assembly passed the budget bill over then gov bruce rauner s veto the governor s office of management and budget found the budget resulted in a 1 5 billion deficit even with the 5 billion tax hike state government had failed to do what families across illinois do every day spend within their means this is not new in illinois in fact over the past 10 years state spending and outstanding debt have consistently outpaced revenues the state needs a tool to rein in the rapid growth of its debt and spending an explicit cap on the growth of state spending set at the growth rate of illinois economy according to the u s census bureau illinois outstanding state debt grew to 62 billion in 2017 from 55 billion in 2007 an increase of 7 billion this includes all debt obligations remaining unpaid as of 2017 but that 62 billion in outstanding debt does not even include accrued state liabilities for pension benefits which moody s investors service estimates at 250 billion total state expenditures grew even faster between 2007 and 2017 total state expenditures grew to 86 billion from 60 billion an increase of 26 billion in spending illinois outstanding debt is already sky high due not only to borrowing but also to the interest that collects on the principal each year and if the general assembly continues to spend at the current pace the state s revenues will never be able to catch up without a way to limit the growth in spending to sustainable levels illinois future holds more punishing tax hikes for already overburdened residents the economic impact of an income tax increase continuously hiking taxes to pay for years of budget mistakes is a recipe for poor economic performance meaning fewer job opportunities and slower wage growth for working illinoisans most economists agree that when lawmakers raise taxes economic growth suffers because higher taxes have a negative impact on investment this was the case with illinois 2011 tax hike which cost the state 56 billion and 9 300 jobs from 2012 to 2016 and will be the case with the 2017 tax hike as well illinois has experienced a decline in investment because of the 2011 tax hike this is made clear by data from the bureau of economic analysis which show that noninvestment spending in the private and public sectors has taken up an increasing share of illinois economy declining investment means a reduction in not just the number of jobs in illinois but also in the quality of those jobs uncertainty over future tax hikes itself can be enough to drive investment out of the state toward a more investment friendly fiscally sound climate spending cap could restore confidence a spending cap means restraining the growth of government spending to what taxpayers can afford providing the certainty individuals and businesses need to thrive business owners make investment decisions with expectations of future returns given the risks involved with any business decision economists agree it is important that public policy does not add to the risk business owners face illinois already has an unfriendly business environment and any uncertainty over the future tax burden from unsustainable increases in state spending will likely lead to business owners holding off on investment and hiring decisions ultimately resulting in slower economic growth a spending cap also incentivizes efficient use of tax dollars using data from 29 countries research by the international monetary fund reveals that fiscal rules have led to stricter prioritization and greater efficiency in spending when expenditure rules are enshrined in law and not just a political promise that can easily be broken they are associated with spending control and improved fiscal discipline higher public sector efficiency would free up resources for more high quality public investments such as certain infrastructure projects that benefit illinoisans and can help to jumpstart the state s sluggish economy it also means averting future tax increases the ability to rein in illinois major cost drivers is limited at present as the illinois supreme court has ruled pension benefits for government workers and the skyrocketing taxpayer costs of funding them are not subject to change a constitutional amendment is necessary to fix this problem however discretionary spending is one area in which lawmakers can practice fiscal responsibility without running afoul of the courts illinois would not be alone in trying to enforce fiscal discipline on its lawmakers 27 other states have some sort of tax or expenditure limitations and 15 of those are enshrined in their constitutions the texas constitution for example restricts growth in appropriations to the growth rate in state personal income with exceptions for constitutionally mandated appropriations or in case of emergencies meanwhile the colorado constitution limits growth in state spending to an index of population and inflation if the illinois general assembly would simply restrict the growth of state spending to the average annual growth in illinois gross domestic product for the last 10 years 2 43 percent for 2008 to 2017 illinois would be on its way to paying off its backlog of bills and eventually repealing the income tax hike when lawmakers control spending and provide a basic level of certainty about the long term

the city of cúcuta colombia lies on the western bank of the tachira river the present day border between colombia and venezuela it was here in 1813 that simón bolívar won his first major victory against the spanish in the wars that secured most of south america s independence after the victory bolívar crossed the tachira rivera and began the liberation of venezuela the land of his birth since 2015 hundreds of thousands of venezuelans have traversed the tachira river in the other direction fleeing economic and political turmoil in their home country some will cross back after earning colombian pesos to spend in their home country the venezuelan bolívar the currency named for the great liberator is essentially worthless handbags made of stitched together bolivares are sold on the streets of cúcuta obtaining foreign currency is the only way many can afford to feed their families while traffic on the bridge is heavy in both directions every day more and more venezuelans are leaving for good escaping a society in free fall in venezuela one cannot get rice anymore said an indigenous man i met in cúcuta after he fled venezuela in venezuela everything is expensive in venezuela when the children get sick and you take them to the hospitals there is no medicine that s why we re here in colombia as south america s refugee crisis deepens attitudes toward venezuelans are hardening across the continent in brazil local governments have attempted to close the border with venezuela in august 2018 xenophobic attacks upon venezuelan refugees and their makeshift dwellings prompted the deployment of brazilian troops in chile new visa rules require venezuelans to apply for refugee status from within venezuela where the asylum process has essentially come to a halt meanwhile ecuador and peru have closed their borders to venezuelans without passports which are extremely difficult to secure from the venezuelan government and in venezuela itself the crisis has reached a boiling point with two rival claims to the presidency threatening to throw the country into outright violence but it is colombia that is bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis according to the u n high commissioner for refugees over one million venezuelans had arrived in colombia as of may 2018 colombia is not a rich country and is only beginning to emerge from its own decades long internal conflict between the government and guerilla forces there are over seven million internally displaced people living in colombia individuals forced to flee their homes because of persecution or violence and in some regions of the country the fighting continues between the military and various leftist groups which also fight one another the integration of almost one million venezuelan refugees represents a monumental challenge for colombia one that threatens an already fragile social order the helpers helping to bear the burden of receiving thousands of venezuelan refugees every day is the catholic church the church has exerted a powerful influence in the region since the colonial era and was instrumental in negotiating the 2016 peace deal between the colombian government and the farc the largest of the many leftist guerrilla groups that have been at war with the colombian government for the past five decades j r s latin america and the caribbean a division of jesuit refugee service has been active in the region since the early 1980s and conducts crucial work both in colombia and in venezuela now they are on the front lines of the largest refugee crisis in latin america s history over the past three decades tens of thousands of colombians have settled in venezuela escaping the intractable civil conflict in their home country marcelo pérez is one of them a colombian refugee who has lived in venezuela for the past 17 years mr pérez still describes venezuela as the land of opportunity nevertheless mr pérez conceded the situation here is tight it s not a secret a venezuelan refugee carrying a venezuelan flag and her child cross the simón bolívar bridge between venezuela and colombia past colombian army soldiers j r s photo by george castellanos but mr pérez feels that he will be able to weather the storm saying in an interview with j r s representatives that for us colombians wherever we go we don t stand around we do our best to get ahead the venezuelan government takes a dimmer view of its colombian refugee population venezuela s economic problems became acute in 2015 when a collapse in the price of oil rattled an economy already weakened by severe fiscal mismanagement colombian refugees proved to be an easy scapegoat august 2015 was the big turning point when the venezuelan government deported and forcibly repatriated more than 22 000 colombians residing in venezuela along with their families said oscar calderón the j r s coordinator in the state of norte de santander which covers cúcuta and much of the venezuelan border region from then till 2016 it was mostly a dynamic of colombians returning from venezuela j r s in cúcuta scrambled to meet this first wave of displaced people from venezuela but the worst was yet to come according to mr calderón 2016 was the fateful turning point when venezuelans began to flee this is a highly complex migration he said there are people who flee from direct threats to their lives others who flee seeking medication mixed colombian venezuelan families but arriving in colombia is no guarantee of safety or stability the tachira river marks a very violent borderland contested by guerrilla groups and drug cartels a region scarred by poverty and resentment this is the world in which those who fled venezuela must now somehow rebuild their lives sister republics once upon a time venezuela and colombia were meant to be one country that was simón bolívar s dream the state of gran colombia encompassed all of present day colombia venezuela panama and ecuador in addition to portions of guyana brazil and peru until it broke apart by the early 1830s not far from the simón bolívar bridge lie the ruins of a catholic church that was destroyed by an earthquake in 1875 it was in this church that the original colombian constitution was signed in 1821 today the bridge is the main entry point for venezuelan refugees on the colombian side is a chaotic bus terminal and market known simply as la parada the stop or the station venezuelans of all ages and backgrounds sit in the shade of trees with their backpacks and suitcases pondering their next step all around them are street vendors scam artists bus ticket peddlers aid workers and colombian police and military all trying to impose some order on the chaos or to find a way to profit from the new arrivals large billboards advertise bus lines and fares to get to places like bogotá lima or santiago the most common destinations for the venezuelan refugees who do not intend to return home colombian authorities appear to be as mystified about what to do with the sudden influx of refugees as the venezuelans are about what they will do next at la parada there is a food kitchen run by the diocese of cúcuta every day over 1 000 venezuelans are fed here and 100 or more must be turned away prioritizing women and children and often faced with desperate men attempting to get in the church volunteers and a priest do their best to uphold both a semblance of order and the dignity of the refugees they serve it is a challenging task volunteers more than once have had to close the gate to the food kitchen as those outside banged on the door on the day i visited a group of venezuelans alleged the colombian police had set fire to their belongings j r s staff told me this is a common occurrence nevertheless the venezuelan population of cúcuta keeps growing as few can afford to travel any farther all over cúcuta venezuelans are living on the street in impromptu shanty towns on the outskirts of the city or in church and government shelters already filled past capacity colombian authorities appear to be as mystified about what to do with the sudden influx of refugees as the venezuelans are about what they will do next venezuelan migrants line up for a meal provided by the diocese of cucuta near la parada photo by antonio de loera brust this situation is exacerbating existing problems in cúcuta for mr calderón it represents a challenge to the mission of j r s how do we build hospitality when border communities are suffering poverty abandonment injustice the systemic failure of the colombian state to integrate migrants has made them live in the poorest regions of colombia forcing them to compete with colombians for the bare minimum a particularly tragic example of the conflict among people living in poverty stems from the sudden influx of venezuelan women working as prostitutes in cúcuta colombian currency is a lifeline for venezuelan families a single colombian peso is worth 70 venezuelan bolivars and according to j r s workers many venezuelan women and girls are turning to sex work as the quickest way to earn cash this in turn has driven down the wages of established colombian sex workers and created severe social tensions and even violence between colombian prostitutes and venezuelan prostitutes women and children all sectors of venezuelan society are represented among the refugees those who can afford to do so have already settled in places like madrid or miami the daily flows of refugees in cúcuta represent the less fortunate especially the poor and members of the now vanished middle class indigenous groups face particularly strong discrimination from colombian authorities despite often belonging to tribes whose historic homelands straddle the colombian venezuelan border amid the crisis there is one group that stands out pregnant women no other group of refugees seems to be as overrepresented or as vulnerable pregnant women or mothers with newborns are everywhere in cúcuta both the public and private health care system in venezuela nearly to the point of collapse said mr calderón according to j r s workers many venezuelan hospitals are no longer able to perform c sections and pregnant venezuelans are at risk of malnutrition because of the country s food shortage the money just wasn t enough no breakfast no dinner parents leave in venezuela it s all grandparents and children now jesuit refugee service pays for an ultrasound examination for every pregnant venezuelan woman they identify it is almost always the first ultrasound the mother has ever received sometimes it comes too late one j r s worker spoke of a venezuelan refugee whose ultrasound revealed her child had been dead inside her for almost a month because of malnutrition the woman refused to believe it and returned to venezuela carrying her dead child inside her j r s continues to check up on venezuelan women around cúcuta conducting postnatal visits to collect information and help secure basic necessities for the mothers and newborn babies one of those mothers is jenny a 25 year old venezuelan woman who recently gave birth in colombia jenny left behind two sons in venezuela a 4 year old and a 2 year old and came to colombia in search of a way to send money home i couldn t get food she told me no matter how hard the father and i worked the money just wasn t enough no breakfast no dinner parents leave in venezuela it s all grandparents and children now jenny left two children behind in venezuela when she came to colombia to work selling her small plot of land to pay for the passage but when she became pregnant in colombia jenny knew that for the sake of the baby she could not return to venezuela in venezuela there s nothing she said to get care in a hospital one needs to buy everything you need to buy the gloves if necessary you even need to buy the needles lots of people have died due to lack of medical attention jenny holds her newborn on her bed in the scalabrini run migrant shelter in cucuta photo by antonio de loera brust jenny is staying at the scalabrini shelter in cúcuta which has become a hub for venezuelan migrant mothers and their children the shelter is one of many across the americas run by the order of scalabrini priests who were founded in 1887 to assist italian immigrants in the united states and brazil migrating isn t anything easy the colombians do help not all of them are bad just like venezuelans there are good and bad jenny said she has little hope however that the situation in venezuela will improve under the current regime but for now jenny has her eyes fixed only on the future she is unsure whether she should return to venezuela with her newborn or bring her two older children to colombia some women who stay here start to cry saying this is terrible that they want to go back she said but others say no go forward never backward don t even think about going back across the border venezuela s collapse it is hard to overstate the totality of the societal collapse in venezuela basic necessities like food and medicine are devastatingly scarce the economic collapse has fueled a violent crime rate that is among the highest in the world according to the united nations refugee agency as of november 2018 the number of venezuelans who have fled has now surpassed three million none of this was supposed to happen venezuela home to some of the world s largest petroleum reserves was once one of the richest countries in latin america with a gross domestic product far above its neighbors but in 1998 decades of severe inequality and political corruption led venezuelans to democratically elect hugo chávez a former army officer who had been jailed for participating in a failed coup in 1992 calling his movement bolívarian after simón bolívar president chávez promised all venezuelans would share in the nation s wealth and overcame fierce opposition from the established political order and the business class including an attempted coup against him in 2002 mr chávez consolidated power and redistributed the wealth produced by venezuela s state run oil company to the poor in the form of social services this earned him popular support even as he weakened democratic institutions and repressed his political opponents whom he painted as proxies for the united states it is hard to overstate the totality of the societal collapse in venezuela by the time of his death from cancer in march 2013 president chávez s 14 years in power had left venezuela s constitutional system hollowed out and the economy dangerously dependent on its poorly managed oil sector mr chávez s appointed successor nicolás maduro continued the consolidation of political power even as the economic warning signs grew in 2014 the venezuelan government responded violently to a wave of student protests driven by high inflation and food shortages soon after the price of oil collapsed taking a good portion of venezuela s g d p with it as economic conditions inside venezuela worsen the government is becoming increasingly repressive freedom house amnesty international and human rights watch have documented increasing repression and human rights abuses year after year after the disputed presidential election in 2018 saw mr maduro returned to power the organization of american states passed a resolution calling for venezuela s membership to be suspended indicating venezuela s government is increasingly isolated not just from the united states but from its fellow latin american states while the maduro government has long defied predictions of its imminent collapse dramatic developments in january 2019 indicate the regime s time could be running out after mounting protests juan guaido the 35 year old president of the venezuelan national assembly declared himself the interim president of venezuela until free and transparent elections take place mr guaido quickly gained recognition as the legitimate head of state from the united states most of the european union colombia and many other latin american nations nicolás maduro however still has the support of the military while the maduro government has long defied predictions of its imminent collapse dramatic developments in 2019 indicate the regime s time could be running out we hope god takes control of this that venezuela returns to a normal government said one venezuelan refugee who wished to remain anonymous he had been forced to flee venezuela after blowing the whistle on the venezuelan military for selling food on the black market we have faith in god that this government sooner or later will fall we can t be afraid of being imprisoned or tortured or killed we want to return to our country someday the place that saw us born to be with our families peace no justice if venezuela is a once prosperous country facing ruin colombia is showing signs of finally turning the page after being one of the most violent countries in the world in 2015 the historic colombian peace accords between the government of colombia and the farc represented the most hopeful development in the south american country after decades of war pope francis welcomed the havana accords and kept a promise to visit colombia once a peace deal was reached but after decades of war peace can feel like an injustice for many colombians some felt the deal offered clemency to leftist guerrillas responsible for decades of atrocities others felt the deal did not address the war crimes committed by the government aligned right wing paramilitary groups the disarmament process has also created a power vacuum especially in the catatumbo region of northeast colombia near the venezuelan border the farc was only the largest of the leftist guerrilla groups in the farc s absence both the ejército de liberación nacional and the ejército popular de la liberación continue to fight against the government as well as each other for control over drug trafficking turf colombia is showing signs of finally turning the page after being one of the most violent countries in the world to prop up the peace process in the region j r s focuses on eliminating the cultivation of coca in order to break the cycle of violence associated with the drug trade j r s has also resettled thousands of colombian internally displaced persons within cúcuta in particular those who face threats of violence or reprisal from guerilla or paramilitary factions not too far from the hilltop where simón bolívar won his famous victory there lives a resettled i d p family a mother a father and two children from the catatumbo all of whom wished to remain to anonymous the husband had been a motorcycle courier taking packages from village to village along the treacherous jungle roads his wife told me the story the husband himself was so shaken he could not speak of the incident one day he was pressured into moving drugs when he came upon a military roadblock he discarded the drugs drawing the ire of traffickers soon after he was threatened again and given a day to get out of the catatumbo or risk being killed it was the wife who roused the family packed the bags and got in touch with contacts at the diocese of tibu who got the family out it is not this woman s first time having to flee she had fled her home village years before after her brothers were killed by guerillas or perhaps paramilitaries no one really knows who kills whom she said matter of factly the most striking legacy of colombia s multisided internal conflict is mixed families after massacres survivors of different families will pair up and form a new family a man who has lost his wife will take as a new wife the woman who lost her husband children who were orphaned will be taken in by families whose own children were killed so the bonds of community are preserved even in the harshest of circumstances an uncertain future the tensions of the colombian conflict were on everyone s mind going into the presidential election on june 17 2018 the elections pitted ivan duque a georgetown university educated hardline opponent of the 2016 peace deal against gustavo petro a leftist and environmentalist who was briefly a guerrilla himself in many ways the fact the colombian conflict was being settled at the ballot box and not with bullets was itself an enormously positive sign of how far colombia has come yet political developments since the election may bode ill for the hard won peace process mr duque who labeled the peace deal with the farc a monument to impunity won in a landslide his victory is widely seen as a mandate for a tougher line on guerrilla groups in the catatumbo many viewed his election with dread the peace will be over worried one former coca farmer in january 2019 u s secretary of state mike pompeo pledged u s support for new colombian eradication efforts seeking to curtail coca production by 50 percent by 2023 president duque also played on the fears among voters that what happened in venezuela could happen in colombia labeling his left wing opponent a socialist indeed some venezuelan refugees expressed their support for mr duque during the campaign hoping he will lead efforts to drive president maduro from power but it is possible that mr duque will also implement harsher measures to stem the flow of venezuelans into colombia in cúcuta where anti refugee sentiment runs high mr duque won almost 80 percent of the vote amid high turnout much of latin america is closing its doors ending a long tradition of relatively open borders on the continent but for now colombia is still the destination for an increasing number of venezuelans much of the rest of latin america is closing its doors ending a long tradition of relatively open borders on the continent the election of the far right congressman jair bolsonaro labeled the brazilian trump as the president of brazil will likely dramatically increase the migratory pressure on colombia in venezuela should maduro respond with force to what his government has labeled a coup president trump has stated all options are on the table continuing military threats against venezuela that go back to 2017 u s national security experts however have argued such an intervention could be a disaster more likely to resemble the decade long occupations of iraq and afghanistan than the speedy invasions of grenada or panama in all likelihood an armed conflict would only worsen the refugee crisis nevertheless some venezuelan refugees would welcome military action seeing anything as preferable to the current situation i have my family there it hurts to say this but let the gringos come and invade my country and take him out in one punch one venezuelan refugee told me has said rifle against rifle he wants rifles let the gringos come and invade if he wants lead let them give him lead the one thing the united states could do to dramatically improve the situation of venezuelans would be to resettle them as refugees yet despite taking a hard line on the maduro regime the trump administration has done little for venezuelan refugees indeed venezuelans have been deported to venezuela even as the trump administration condemns the venezuelan government on human rights grounds with the united states missing in action there is no one coming to help colombia bear the burden bolívar s memory continues to exert a powerful pull on the imagination of both countries there doesn t seem to be a bettering of the economic or political or social situation that will prevent people fleeing venezuela says mr calderón instead what we see is that every time it s people who are more vulnerable who are poorer who are arriving at the border colombia s system for refugees is too feeble from the small ramshackle offices of j r s in cúcuta mr calderón surveys the continent across latin america we are seeing various migrant movements where we see so much human pain that s what we see in the streets of cúcuta people on the streets with little food at the mercy of discrimination and criminalization at play here are very profound spiritual values about human dignity and about the protection of that dignity mr calderón who has been in cúcuta since 2010 longer than almost any other j r s worker does not come off as being remotely optimistic at the same time through his weariness he never hints at giving up colombia has to remember what countries in this region have represented for us in the past as countries that welcomed our people we have to make historical memory of that hospitality we must not now be inferior to the challenge of history simón bolívar s dream of a united colombia and venezuela is surely part of that challenge bolívar s memory continues to exert a powerful pull on the imagination of both countries there is a reason hugo chávez claimed bolívar s name for his revolution perhaps there is still some feeling of siblinghood between colombians and venezuelans waiting to be rediscovered

wolfgang schäuble was one of the most influential german politicians never to have been chancellor the challenges that he faced as president of germany s parliament included the rising far right afd wolfgang schäuble s election in october 2017 as president of the bundestag was widely expected after angela merkel s christian democrats nominated him as their candidate for the post over the intervening weeks it had became clear that politicians of other stripes were also hoping that his 75 years 44 of them as a member of germany s parliament would bring some necessary authority to the role of parliamentary session referee after all with a lower house that now included the far right alternative for germany afd the debates promised to be somewhat more rambunctious indeed both the center left social democratic party spd and the neo liberal free democratic party fdp had already signaled their support for his nomination the move marked the end of the abrasive veteran s eight year reign at the finance ministry and the beginning of surely the last chapter of one of the most impressive and era defining careers in german politics one that included party donations scandals four ministerial posts and an assassination attempt that has left him in a wheelchair since 1990 hero of german politics schäuble made farewell tour stops at the annual summit of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank in washington where he did not shy away from warning the host country against sliding into protectionism also in washington was the man many tip as schäuble s successor werner hoyer 65 president of the european investment bank and more crucially for the coalition talks a member of the fdp and an early supporter of its young leader christian lindner at the summit hoyer was effusive about the man he might replace though suitably modest about his own ambitions i hope the heads of the new coalition in berlin find someone who has the courage to follow mr schäuble who has been a hero of german politics in the last 40 years who will continue to be that in his new position and who has stamped his seal on europe s budgetary stability in the past eight years but the veteran cdu man who has been showered with national honors and honorary doctorates throughout his career everything from the order of merit of the italian republic in 1986 to the kissinger prize in 2017 is not without a murkier side in 1997 schäuble s career trajectory seemed set when helmut kohl anointed him as his preferred successor only for the cdu s party donation scandal to trip him up in 2000 schäuble admitted to having accepted a six figure donation for the cdu from arms dealer and convicted tax evader karlheinz schreiber something he had previously kept hidden still as political analyst josef janning of the european council on foreign relations points out the rehabilitated schäuble s authority in government is beyond doubt it will emerge over time what a distinctive influence he had over german politics he predicted the last european standing for janning this reputation comes down to one chief factor schäuble s commitment to the european union as a visionary project rather than just a convenient economic alliance he s the last in the generation of politicians for whom europe was not just another bargaining place it was a piece of the raison d etre of german statehood he said much more than the chancellor he was someone who would lie awake at night over europe where merkel is a pragmatist schäuble would say we have to think in longer terms wolfgang schäuble seen here in 1998 was once tipped to become helmut kohl s successor image dpa many other european leaders chief among them the former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis took exception to schäuble s commitment to the eu when it came at the cost of imposing massive austerity on the bloc s weaker economies the french economy minister arnaud montebourg described schäuble in 2014 as a hawk of inflation criticism that eventually cost the frenchman his job given the job that he is about to take on another notable hallmark of schäuble s hardline handling of the euro crisis was his rejection of the parliament s calls for more say in the euro bailout measures schäuble is very much an executive person said janning he does not share the concern about parliament s lack of power greek economist yannis varoufakis fought hard against schäuble s austerity policies image picture alliance schäuble has seen it all but he will no doubt bring many other qualities to the chamber for one thing schäuble is no stranger to provocative voices in the bundestag he has seen everything added janning he has seen the greens arrive in parliament and he has seen how they were isolated and stigmatized in the beginning i think that his responsibility is to show that this democracy has matured to a degree that it can live with fringe positions of course schäuble s obsession with balancing the budget with reducing government spending while refusing to lower taxes was also felt domestically schäuble was convinced that the cdu s claim that they could be the ones to get the budget situation under control had to be delivered in order to remain credible said janning and this is something that resonates with many in his own party this was achieved in 2014 when he became the first german finance minister since 1969 to deliver a balanced budget something that as far as janning is concerned was only possible because of the minister s natural authority in the cabinet his party succeeded in balancing the budget because it was so difficult to argue against schäuble that will become more complicated now without him the spending arguments will be longer this story was lightly altered for tense on december 27 2023 on the occasion of wolfgang schäuble s death
global dividend payouts are expected to slow to their longer term trend of 5 in 2019 after a stellar 2018 according to asset manager janus henderson last year was a difficult one for risk assets after a 2017 that saw almost all equity markets rise that reversed and 2018 was one of renewed volatility and challenging macro economic and geopolitical conditions as a result many markets around the world fell in tandem but for those investors seeking an income from stocks 2018 was in hindsight pretty good global dividends rose to a record 1 37 trillion according to janus henderson s global dividend index that was 8 5 higher than 2017 on an underlying basis which strips out currency movements special dividends and other factors that could distort the results the growth was the fastest seen since 2015 factors that contributed to this were the normalisation of payments from miners banks and oil majors after an extended period of low or no dividends and the increasing trend towards tech companies returning cash to shareholders us president donald trump s tax cuts helped too for 2019 underlying growth is expected to return to trend at 5 1 and dividends are expected to hit 1 41

were it a work of fiction bill browder s story would stretch the bounds of credibility well beyond the breaking point but as it happens it s all true the scion of american communist royalty he became a devout capitalist and made his fortune in the privatization frenzy that developed in eastern europe following the collapse of the iron curtain and then his saga which is detailed in his bestselling red notice gets even more interesting from the falling out with the vladimir putin regime to the championing of the magnitsky act browder s life morphed from an unconventional success story into a tense and harrowing thriller we spoke with browder who will be addressing the 2019 salt conference this may for his take on the current geopolitical environment the investment management landscape what advice he d give to his younger self and more below is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation cfa institute thank you for taking the time to talk about all things investment management in red notice you compare the thrill of an investment ten bagger to discovering crack cocaine is this how you found your way into investment management bill browder it actually goes back a little bit further than that in that i ended up first of all being interested in russia because of my rebellion from my family my grandfather was the head of the communist party of america during the 1930s and 1940s and so when i was going through my teenage rebellion i became a capitalist when the berlin wall came down i decided that if my grandfather was the biggest communist in america i would try to become the biggest capitalist in eastern europe it was then after that after i graduated business school i moved to london to try to be closer to eastern europe in my very first job as a management consultant at the boston consulting group i went to poland in poland i saw they were doing the very first privatizations and i bought shares i had a total of 2 000 of life savings i invested the 2 000 in the polish privatization it went up 10 times and at that point the whole thing crystallized from that point on i knew what i wanted to do which was to be an investor in the privatizations in eastern europe and set out to do so what were your formative influences probably the most formative influence was a boss that i had at salomon brothers a guy named bobby ludwig who was head of the proprietary trading desk at salomon he was like no other person i had ever worked with he was completely unmoved by conventional wisdom or by fads or what was popular he was the most clearâ thinking value investor i d ever met when i was discussing different types of situations with him and seeing his reaction and seeing his disdain for what everybody else was doing it helped me get into a mindset of thinking independently about investments and not worrying about what everybody else thought that was crucial because when we discovered russia everybody thought at the time that it was crazy to invest in a country in such a chaotic mess the chaotic mess part was true but the valuation of russia was at a valuation discount of 99 7 the logic was that even though it was horrible if you went from horrible to bad you can make a lot of money i wouldn t have been able to have that confidence if it hadn t been being around a sort of iconoclastic investor like bobby ludwig ben graham the legendary investor and founder of cfa institute warned about value traps as ceo of hermitage capital how did you come up with the incredibly prescient thesis that 1990s russia was not a value trap when we discovered russia it was trading at a 99 7 because it was horrible if there was no catalyst to improve it then it wouldn t matter how discounted it was we ve seen a lot of situations around the world that are horrible and stay horrible or situations that are horrible that get even worse the key is low value with some type of catalyst for improvement in a certain way my career has been a testament to how that works and a testament to how it doesn t work because russia went from horrible to bad and my portfolio over a relatively short period of time went up 40 times reverse logic is also true when things go from bad back to horrible you can see equally dramatic drops it s really all about valuation and about some type of improvement happening at the same time your ability to survive one of these reversals in 1998 holds great lessons for investors the market crash followed the russian government debt default which led to the collapse of the all star led hedge fund long term capital management ltcm how did you manage to persuade your investors to stay the course en route to that 40 times return i would not attribute it to anything good that i did but more to how extreme the situation was if you re running an investment fund let s say you re running an emerging markets fund and you lose your clients 25 of their money there s a very high probability that they re going to throw in the towel redeem and say they ve had enough pain if you re running a russia fund like i was and suddenly suffer 90 drawdown of course nobody is happy with you but at that point they think well maybe there s a chance that it s gone down so much i better just stick it out to see if i can get some type of recovery i would argue that most of my clients stayed with me not out of any type of loyalty but because we had gone down so far they thought that there was at least a chance that it could bounce back a key to gaining and keeping investors is having the ability to tell a story you are renowned for the visual way you break down and simplify complex narratives how do you do it probably one of the greatest training programs i ever went on was my first job out of business school working at the boston consulting group the reason they were so useful and great and it s been useful and great not just in investing but in everything else in my life is that one of the things that management consultants are paid to do by their clients is to take highly complex situations simplify them and then put them into a powerpoint presentation i learned how to do that in my first two years in boston consulting group and then when i went into salomon brothers and as an investor after salomon brothers i took those skills with me what was interesting is that almost nobody else in the financial world had those skills i was able and i m still able to take complicated stories and put them into a relatively clear visually understandable and repeatable powerpoint presentation and that s often all people need the interesting thing is that a lot of times people are taught in life that you have to use jargon because you learn jargon and therefore you should use financial jargon or any other type of jargon to show how professional you are what i learned is that you do just the opposite you take anything that s complicated and you try to get rid of any type of jargon even if you re talking to people who know the jargon because everybody appreciates just understanding a simple clear story activism and corporate governance became key to hermitage capital s investment approach after 1998 what drove this change when i first got involved in russia it was all about value it was all about the relative valuations and how extremely low they were however when i started to have large positions in big russian companies we discovered that the low valuations in many cases were justified because even if you owned your share of the company you didn t really have a share of the profits because the profits were often being stolen by the majority shareholders who were oligarchs the situation got to be so extreme and particularly in 1998 after the russian government defaulted and devalued and the stock market went down 90 we basically couldn t have survived as investors if we didn t stop some of the stealing that was going on at these companies like i said being an activist investor is a higher return form of investing than being a value investor i basically came to the conclusion that i wasn t going to be in business if we didn t get active and it was a matter of survival as opposed to good investment strategy once i became an activist investor then a whole new set of challenges came in because being an activist in russia meant trying to stop the corrupt oligarchs from stealing money those people who were stealing money were not happy with anyone trying to stop them because that money they felt entitled to there were lots of physical danger and other types of dangers going after people who were stealing money those dangers eventually materialized and caused me terrible problems when i was expelled from the country and the whole magnitsky story began how did your approach to risk management change after adopting an activist stance risk management approach the way i viewed it at the time sure enough proved to be completely wrong context is important my portfolio just went down 90 i was trying to save the last 10 cents on the dollar the way i viewed the risk reward was that the risk was that i lost the last 10 cents on the dollar and the reward was that it would go back up i always thought that it was just a purely financial risk i didn t understand the risk went far beyond that and of course that was a crucial error in my judgment at a macroeconomic level emerging markets investment strategists tend to focus on the sovereign debt ratios on the currency exchange rates the oil prices what is your approach what i would say first of all is that the thing that nobody seems to spend any time on and the thing that s so dramatically important is none of the normal metrics that you would look at are important without looking first at the rule of law and property rights everybody i know they look at growth rates they look at gdp issues they look at indebtedness they look at currency valuations none of them look at what happens if something good happens in your company and then somebody tries to take it away from you what is your recourse everybody seems to undervalue that issue i would argue from my experience over decades investing that the rule of law is paramount is the crux of any investment strategy a country that doesn t have some semblance of rule of law is effectively un investable any advice for investors considering putting emerging markets in their portfolios i think that it s all a function of how much you want to put at risk one of the things that i would say is that we re all a little bit misled by the longâ term success of us equity markets over hundreds of years the idea is if you look at the us equity market it has always gone up maybe you pick a bad performing time but it s higher now than it ever has been however that is an unusual situation if you look in emerging markets what you ll see in many cases they just go up and down and up and down and unless you can time it properly you can t just put it away forget about it and just believe in the future of equity markets as a result i think that people have to be very much focused on exits and timing their exits in emerging markets because that will make all the difference between a highly profitable investment and a total disaster the united states has contributed a great deal to global uncertainty recently how do you incorporate this and other developed market sources of market volatility into your investment philosophy i think as of now we re are in a whole new paradigm because of trump who s created all sorts of uncertainties about government shutdowns and trade wars also the independence of the us federal reserve bank which was never put in question before you add on top of that issues like brexit and other things and you end up with a situation where the places that we took for granted as being the anchors of stability are now potentially the causes of instability and that s a very new and uncharted dynamic of how to think about financial markets large pension funds if you were to advise them on portfolio allocations should they be incorporating this new source of geopolitical risk if you look at the market cap of the world the places that make up the largest part of the market cap are in the united states and western europe and they deserve to be because those are the places that have the rule of law and property rights etc now we re in a situation where lots of stuff can happen that was unheard of before and there s no way of sidestepping it it s not like you can find some other place to invest that doesn t have these issues everything is connected to everything so we re all in this together now if the trade war leads to a spike in inflation and that leads to a spike in interest rates then markets can really go down a lot which i don t think anyone wants to happen that s one of the possible scenarios that could come out of this situation now trade wars are just one type of non financial risk what are your other concerns there s a lot i think that we re all watching china s environment at what interest rate do things start to crack do these trade wars get worse if so what does that do to inflation and interest rates probably the most worrying thing is we re entering an era of potential military conflicts tensions between sovereign states may result in a huge unexpected pressure on the valuation of financial assets câ suite talks readers especially in the interesting times we are living in right now want to learn from the best minds in the investment

interview with börsen zeitung interview with peter praet member of the executive board of the ecb conducted by detlef fechtner and mark schrörs on 11 february 2019 and published on 18 february 2019 mr praet how badly is the euro area economy doing we have lately seen a marked increase in the risks for the euro area economy that is why we revised our assessment at the last meeting of the ecb s governing council in january we see the constellation of risks surrounding the economic outlook in other words the balance of risks as tilted to the downside that is a significant change in our communication and reflects concerns about the general economic situation at the same time however we said that our baseline scenario has so far remained intact in march we will have new macroeconomic projections from ecb staff and we will then re examine our assessment the december projections for 2019 to 2021 forecast growth of 1 7 1 7 and 1 5 and a gradual rise in inflation to 1 8 in 2021 so approaching the ecb s target rate of below but close to 2 that surely can t be upheld now can it i expect that the projections for the near term in particular will be revised downwards the data since december have been much weaker than i had expected but our discussion in the ecb s governing council does not focus so much on the short term perspective the medium term perspective is decisive for us most especially the question of whether we are dealing with a temporary soft patch or with a more prolonged weakness and your response particularly in view of the continuing weak data since the last governing council meeting first of all the data since the january meeting have not only held negative surprises they have also contained a few positive signs such as the further decline in unemployment but it s also true that growth in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 and most likely also in the first quarter of 2019 is well below the potential growth rate of the euro area economy so growth will have been below potential for three consecutive quarters and that s not good news the question now is whether there will be a rebound in the second quarter and beyond a rebound is likely but it is too early to say by how much so would you say that the ecb s governing council is becoming less confident that we are now merely seeing a temporary economic dip the economic slowdown is broader and more persistent than had been thought and growth in the short term is likely to fall short of previous expectations but as i said what counts for us is the medium term outlook and we see positive and negative factors there what does that mean in practice on the positive side the situation for households and so for consumption is still favourable that is a key driver of growth employment is still increasing and wages are picking up boosting disposable income lower oil prices are also strengthening purchasing power the fiscal stance has become slightly more expansionary in the euro area as a whole that is not a major development but it helps a little euro area non financial firms are doing well too of course there are still some weak spots in the corporate sector and these pose some risk but all in all corporate balance sheets are in good shape so they have the capacity to invest but there is indeed a negative side too and what s on that side the biggest problem by far is that political uncertainties have been persisting for so long now whether they are related to protectionism to brexit etc the more time passes the greater their likely negative impact on the economy in the context of persistent uncertainties additional shocks can have large effects on the economy the uncertainties are already tempering business confidence more severely than expected the state of the uk economy shows the damage that can occur when uncertainty persists for too long investment in the united kingdom has fallen sharply it is high time to put an end to these uncertainties in a positive way is your main concern for the euro area economy also to do with firms readiness to invest the uncertainties are increasingly affecting business confidence in the euro area and are likely to affect investment in 2019 if confirmed this would be bad news for the european economy that needs investment following years of underinvestment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis moroever the question is how the financial sector would react what exactly do you mean by that the financial sector often tends to act procyclically banks are a case in point because they tend to amplify cyclical developments when the economy is performing well they are willing to grant credit but when it is faltering they are not so keen do you see such a risk at present as far as the capital markets are concerned credit risk premia have increased significantly over the past months for both high and low credit rated firms that tightens borrowing conditions for firms on capital markets and weighs on the economy on the other hand we have so far not seen any such tightening in bank lending conditions in the euro area overall in light of these developments we consider that the probability of a recession remains low but are you worried that that will change that the banks will tighten conditions too banks in the euro area now hold much more capital than before and are better able to withstand shocks they also have larger liquidity buffers that s all good news at the same time bank equity prices have fallen sharply and profitability is often very low as is also reflected in the banks very low price to book ratio of around 50 in such a context there is a risk that the banks could act even more procyclically than they usually do and would amplify the cycle to be clear the uncertainties and the economic slowdown have so far not caused banks to tighten their lending conditions or to grant less credit but we need to keep a very close eye on how this evolves how will the banks behave if the economic slowdown continues would you say that financing conditions in the euro area as a whole have already tightened significantly financing conditions have tightened somewhat in recent months but not significantly thanks in part to our forward guidance on interest rates this partly compensates for such effects but you re absolutely right we as central bankers must always ask ourselves whether our monetary policy stance is appropriate for us to attain our objective and what is your answer at the moment we have revised our assessment of risks to growth downward i would say that is a clear indication that the level of alert is higher than before three quarters of below potential growth higher risks and at least slightly tighter financing conditions what does that signify for the inflation outlook is the ecb s governing council losing its confidence in reaching the target of 2 over the medium term three quarters of below potential growth are certainly not good news but we have a medium term perpective at our last monetary policy meeting we upheld the assessment that inflation will converge to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term wages are picking up at a pace that is more or less in line with expectations from our models one thing that has not worked out as expected is the transmission to consumer prices this pass through is not working in line with projections we are analysing this very carefully but we remain confident that it will eventually do so we need to be patient and persistent but what if the economic outlook deteriorates further and more permanently in our baseline scenario capacity utilisation will remain high and firms will be in a position to pass higher wages through to higher prices that would be more difficult if growth remained below potential downside risks to growth could then lead to downside risks to inflation in the medium term we are not at that stage yet but this will be an important discussion point at the next meetings of the ecb s governing council but if the outlook becomes gloomier what will happen then will the ecb s governing council be even more careful in continuing on its cautious path towards monetary policy normalisation or could there be another turn towards more easing i have never spoken about a normalisation of our monetary policy stance i have always referred to a normalisation of our instruments there is a big difference after the end of our net asset purchases the primary instrument to steer our monetary policy stance is again our key interest rates and as far as their path is concerned we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term this rotation of instruments from net purchases to the rate path has been implemented in such a way as to preserve our accommodative monetary policy stance we have thus not tightened our monetary policy moreover we have made it clear that in any event we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner president mario draghi always stresses that the toolbox is full but with interest rates at or even below zero and the asset purchase programme at its self imposed limits what else is really left if there is a problem there needs to be a careful assessment to establish the cause a financial shock for instance is something different from a slowdown in growth for fundamental reasons in the case of an economic slowdown interest rates are generally the instrument of choice if the euro area economy were to slow more sharply we could adapt our forward guidance on interest rates and this could be complemented by other measures but one thing is clear the ecb s governing council will always find ways and means of acting if it needs to in case we would cease to be confident that inflation is converging to a level that is below but close to 2 it would be our mandate to act as a result of the weaker economic data market participants have shifted their expectations for a first interest rate hike from autumn 2019 to in some cases well into 2020 despite the governing council s unchanged outlook that interest rates will remain at their current levels at least through the summer of 2019 do you feel comfortable with that first of all it shows that our forward guidance is effective our forward guidance on key interest rates has both a calendar based at least through the summer of 2019 and a state contingent leg and in any case for as long as necessary the shift in market expectations reflects the state contingent leg of our forward guidance of course there will be a point in time when the calendar based leg of our forward guidance will be discussed and if needed adapted we have been very careful so far not to validate market expectations and at your meeting on 7 march will that still be too early i can t say at this stage would new net asset purchases also be an option in an emergency asset purchases are part of our current toolbox president draghi has been clear about that but that doesn t mean that they are the preferred option in current conditions and it should be said that if forward guidance on interest rates is credible and steers expectations in the desired direction further purchases may not be needed at all to ensure that financing conditions are appropriate observers increasingly expect the ecb to launch new longer term refinancing operations for banks tltros and they make the case that this measure especially in conjunction with an increase in the deposit facility rate could improve the situation for banks and support lending what would you say to that especially in the light of your concerns about the procyclical behaviour of banks our tltros have been a very useful tool to deal with impairments in the transmission of monetary policy and are part of our toolbox as the procyclical behaviour of banks is an important reason why economic cycles sometimes end badly we do need to monitor the transmission of monetary policy through the banking system carefully in march we will make an assessment of the current and expected state of bank transmission you will be leaving the ecb at the end of may having experienced and helped to shape a period of great change at the ecb do you think that zero and negative interest rates forward guidance and extensive asset purchases are the new normal for central banks including the ecb or can there ever be a return to the old regime that existed before the global financial crisis a return to greater normality will certainly take a long time we are very cautious at the ecb about estimates of the natural rate of interest meaning the rate at which growth and inflation are in equilibrium but there doesn t seem to be any doubt that this rate for reasons including demographics and technological progress is now lower than it used to be and that also means that the likelihood of reaching the lower bound on interest rates is much greater than previously thought then other tools are needed as the federal reserve did after the global financial crisis does the ecb need to have a fundamental debate about its mandate its objectives and its strategy especially since the last review in 2003 was more than 15 years ago the mandate is of course out of questions it is enshrined in the treaty however after the experience of the past few years it may also make sense for the ecb to review its overall monetary policy framework in the future but now may not be the right time our strategy has a medium term orientation which gives us more room for manoeuvre and with our two pillar strategy with the monetary analysis we also look closely at aspects of financial stability financial cycles have become increasingly important i think that our framework has strengths that we should preserve central bank independence is increasingly coming under attack around the world not just in the united states but also in italy for example how much does that worry you the independence of central banks is of key importance and should not be called into question whatever the criticism may be every other regime in which the central bank is closer to the finance ministry is much worse than the current system but not everybody seems to agree there may be populists who dream of something different but most politicians are very conscious of the need to keep monetary and fiscal policy separate any other approach can quickly turn dangerous

brief taste of summer on sunday in the south of england with the sun blazing out we were at a friend s house and they had a sandpit outside which attracted all the kids as such though when we returned home we spent most of the evening finding dollops of sand scattered around the house it gets everywhere the bath also ended up with a big dirt ring round its circumference at this stage it feels like there is more chance of winter being gone for good than there is getting our deposit back on our rental accommodation when we move out in 9 weeks just hope the landlord doesn t work in the city and doesn t read this so on to a new week however today is presidents day in the us with bond and equity markets closed so don t expect the most exciting start to proceedings after that we have enough to watch though with the flash pmis around the world on thursday the most interesting especially for europe given its current flirtation with recession a reminder that last month we saw the composite reading for the euro area fall slightly to 51 0 flash february consensus 51 1 and the lowest in five and a half years it was also the fifth consecutive monthly decline and the tenth in the last twelve months the manufacturing print which is expected to slide 0 2pts to 50 3 50 5 in last month has declined for six consecutive months and twelve in the last thirteen given rising concerns about a possible recession in germany there will be plenty of focus on whether or not the manufacturing print can rise above 50 0 again following a decline to 49 7 in january currently the consensus print for germany s manufacturing pmi is 49 9 for the us the manufacturing print is expected to broadly hold steady at 55 0 also important for growth yesterday was the deadline for the us department of commerce to decide on whether or not there is a national security case to impose auto tariffs following a long awaited report the findings of the probe along with recommendations from commerce secretary wilbur ross have been submitted to president trump overnight without the contents being made public yet the findings and reaction are of crucial importance given where the world is going in trade terms and where europe currently is in its recessionary orbit an aggressive response from the us will create huge tensions especially in their relationships with the eu japan and south korea president trump will have up to 90 days to decide on whether or not to take action in part or in full the ft reported that trade lobbyists expect trump to take most of the 90 days to make his decision but will he really not tweet any of the findings especially if they suggest a security risk so watch this space the potential economic impact is not to be underestimated our economists in europe have previously estimated that the cost excluding secondary confidence or financial conditions effects of the trade measures implemented at that point in time august 2018 plus a second round of us china tariffs and an extension to auto tariffs to be equivalent to 0 4 0 5 of euro area gdp with auto tariffs accounting for around half so with growth flirting with recession in q3 q4 this would be very bad news for those hoping and expecting a slow bounce back add a hard brexit on top of this and europe has a few binary risks at the moment if you re looking for more positives then if a lot of the slowdown in europe is actually export and maybe china related then friday s chinese credit growth surprised to the upside and augured well for the months ahead aggregate social financing rose 4 64 trillion yuan versus consensus estimates for a 3 31 trillion rise this pushed the credit impulse into positive territory which has been a good lead indicator of chinese pmis as we ll see below this kicked started a rally on friday that got supercharged by more positive trade headlines and positive tltro talk before we look back on that we ll finish off the highlights of the week ahead in germany on friday we ll see the final q4 gdp revisions a reminder that the preliminary print was much softer than expected at just 0 02 qoq vs 0 2 expected and therefore technically avoiding a recession by the slimmest of margins the smallest of downward revisions could therefore see germany tip into a second consecutive quarter of negative growth see here for our economists latest forecasts for growth in germany which they downgraded to just 0 5 for 2019 this week it ll also be worth keeping an eye on survey readings in germany next week with the february zew survey due on tuesday and february ifo survey on friday meanwhile on wednesday we ll get the fomc minutes from the january 29 30 meeting a reminder that the meeting broadly reaffirmed the fed s intent to be patient in assessing further adjustments to its policy as it awaits the resolution of various crosscurrents that have lifted uncertainty and raised downside risks to the outlook expect the balance sheet run off topic to also be a potential talking

president jean claude juncker and speak to the leader of every eu member state in the days ahead but added that gaining headway in brussels will depend largely on whether she can show a united front at home in the meantime the sunday times reported that steve baker the deputy chairman of the erg told his colleagues that brussels and london were pretending to negotiate while running down the clock so may s brexit deal can be forced through parliament this was rejected by the brexit minister chris heaton harris in an interview with sky news where he said that there s a huge amount of activity from the government in trying to secure a deal citing trips to brussels by may and other senior ministers over the coming days so a week of bubbling brexit tensions likely ahead of the next big vote in the middle of next week turning to last friday now before reviewing the rest of the last week it ended up being an eventful session after the china data first boosted risk italy then dampened it before tltro and positive trade talk reenergized the bulls the china data helped commodities and related asset prices to rally on friday with oil up 2 63 the australian dollar 0 51 and the stoxx basic materials sector gaining 1 94 italian assets saw a wild roundtrip with 10 year btp yields rising as much as 10 5bps to over 2 90 as media outlets reported that claudio borghi a top northern league politician suggested that he was in favor of leaving the european union if upcoming elections do not meet his expectations admittedly borghi is a known euro skeptic and his comments were not especially new but they still moved the market as he described the european project as disastrous and toxic the sharp move completely reversed by the end of the session however after ecb executive board member benoit coeure said that we are discussing a new tltro he also said that the slowdown has been clearly strong and broader than the ecb expected the tltro talk helped btps rally back to flat on the day and boosted italian bank equities 4 05 friday and broader european banks 3 63 in the meantime the ecb governing council member francois villeroy de galhau has said that the slowdown in the european economy is significant while adding that the main problem which euro area is facing is global political uncertainty elsewhere the drumbeat of positive rhetoric on us china trade talks continued with treasury secretary mnuchin saying the meetings last week were productive president xi saying the parties achieved important progress and president trump saying it s going extremely well

it has been more than nine years since i resigned in protest over the escalation of the afghan war from my position as a political officer with the us state department in afghanistan it had been my third time to war along with several years of working in positions effecting war policy in washington dc with the department of defense dod and the state department my resignation in 2009 was not taken lightly by my superiors and my reasons for opposing president obama s surge in afghanistan found support amongst both military officers and civilian officials at senior levels in kabul and washington i was repeatedly asked not to resign and was offered a more senior position within the state department richard holbrooke then the president s appointed representative for afghanistan and pakistan told me he agreed with 95 of what i had written and asked me to join his staff while the us ambassador karl eikenberry told me my analysis was one of the best he had encountered and stated he would write an introduction endorsing my resignation letter if i remained with the us embassy in afghanistan for the remainder of my tour in conversation with the us deputy ambassador to afghanistan he agreed the war was not just unwinnable but also corrupt and stated he would not let his children serve in such a war further support for my views was provided by my counterparts who were serving as political officers in the most violent parts of afghanistan kandahar helmand kunar nuristan and oruzgan provinces these men and women made clear their agreement with my assessment and my resignation the support from the military was equally effusive and genuine often such support included apologies along the lines of i d like to resign too but i ve got kids heading to college in a few years the golden handcuffs are an incredibly instrumental and integral aspect of the us empire s infrastructure when i asked karen deyoung the washington post correspondent who wrote the front page above the fold story on my resignation for the post why she wrote such a piece about me she replied she could not find anyone at the pentagon state department or white house who disagreed with me i relate the above not to cheerlead for myself although the sadness and despondency from witnessing the wars up close and from afar and their cruel constant murder does at times necessitate such crutches for me but to relay my own personal observation of the great lie of war in action the ability of the machine of war to propel itself forward even when those most intimate with the war those most responsible for it and without whose support and effort the war could not continue carry on the war whilst knowing and living the lie full well nearly almost a decade after my resignation there are reports of a possible peace deal in the making for afghanistan what i recognize so clearly and sickeningly just as my mind and my soul can recall the bright scarlet red of fresh arterial blood that dulls in contact with dust and cloth or the clay like frozen set jaw of a dead young man whether he have been called an afghan american or iraqi are the same lies of the war that were so skillfully and effectively utilized by politicians generals and the media to escalate the war in 2009 now being recirculated to defeat any current attempts for peace sacrifice does not confer sanctity when president obama entered office in 2009 less than 30 000 us troops were in afghanistan within a year and a half that number would reach 100 000 us military personnel along with 30 000 nato soldiers from europe and over 100 000 private contractors since 2001 more than 2400 us service members have been killed in afghanistan nearly 1800 of them since 2009 european armies have had more than 1100 soldiers killed and more than 1700 contractors have been killed while performing jobs that in previous wars would have been done by us soldiers tens of thousands have been physically wounded while hundreds of thousands suffer from traumatic brain injuries post traumatic stress disorder ptsd moral injury depression substance abuse and other hidden wounds of war these hidden wounds have very real consequences the us department of veterans affairs reports young men and women who have served in afghanistan and iraq a great many of them have served multiple deployments to both wars have suicide rates six times higher than their civilian peers while infantry units those that have performed the most killing and dying have been seen to have suicide rates fourteen times higher than young civilian men their own age in real numbers that means since 2001 likely more than 9 000 us veterans who have served in afghanistan and iraq have been lost to suicide after returning home the numbers of afghans who have been killed are truly unknown the united nations reporting on civilian casualties which only began in 2009 reports tens of thousands killed with nearly each year since 2009 showing an increase in civilian dead and wounded a monstrous and grievous accomplishment of annual record upon record unama itself cautions its numbers should be understood to be a minimum or base level due to unama s methodology assessments of the total dead in afghanistan over the last seventeen years put total dead at more than 100 000 civilians although most who are familiar with war including myself are quick to say that is a conservative or low end estimate for example jonathan steele has estimated more than 20 000 afghans died as a result of the us bombings in the first four months of us military action following 9 11 at least one million afghans are internally displaced while afghans make up the second largest nationality of the largest refugee population the world has known since world war two with millions living in camps in iran and pakistan or claiming asylum in europe of course the afghan war did not begin in 2001 but began more than forty years ago and not with the soviet union s invasion but with an internal civil war that saw maybe as many 100 000 dead before the soviets invaded us support to afghanistan s mujaheddin the grandfathers of the young men we are fighting today in afghanistan began six months prior to the soviet invasion over forty years of war have completely devastated the people and land of afghanistan as a consequence of the violence afghan society is devastated by ptsd and drug use the countryside has been denuded and deforested resulting in agricultural troubles and water shortages and no industry exists besides the illicit drug trade which despite billions of us dollars spent yields record poppy crops and illicit narcotics exports nearly every year 2018 was an exception due to drought there is a desperate sunk cost argument that haunts all wars that are lost and unworthy as it is more often than not it is those who have not experienced the pain and the destruction of the war who demand more blood and more sacrifice turn on fox news or open the washington post and this will be apparent what makes such an argument even more mean and craven is these deaths ones that need not be lost in vain as it is typically phrased are forever tied and bound by the lies of the war making these deaths eternally ignoble and worthless the dead never to be heroes despite the exaggerations of eulogies bordering often on hagiography but only to be future less victims of the greed and egos that advance and maintain the war even a losing war makes money the total financial costs to the us in direct spending on the war in afghanistan are approaching one trillion dollars peak spending of the war reached more than 100 billion a year and currently runs between 40 and 50 billion a year total costs of all the wars the us has been sending its young men and women to kill and be killed in since 2001 are said to be 6 trillion and this is just for the wars that 6 trillion figure does not include the regular or usual costs of running the military which is now over 600 billion a year or the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on veterans the intelligence agencies nuclear weapons the state department or homeland security this staggering amount may perhaps best be understood by knowing that in interest and debt payments alone the us has spent more than 700 billion on the wars in 17 years regarding overall national security spending this year the us will spend hundreds of billions of dollars as it does each year on debt payments due to past spending on wars the military intelligence veterans etc if you compare washington dc and its suburbs to how they psychically existed prior to 9 11 you will most assuredly note the physical impact the wars and the benefiting military industrial complex has had on the city and its suburbs the pentagon is not confined to that five sided building alongside interstate 395 but rather stretches for miles along the potomac river from the key bridge in rosslyn south through arlington and extending past ronald reagan national airport into alexandria in office building after office building are tens and tens of thousands of men and women working for war likewise in the suburbs particularly west along interstate 66 or north along the baltimore washington highway hundreds of buildings exist to serve the war machine it s not just the defense industry or the contracting firms but also the banks hotels restaurants apartment complexes high rise condominiums and near million dollar mcmansions that have risen to serve and support the pentagon and its wars within these buildings are hundreds of thousands of men and women the majority not wearing a uniform but working for a contracting firm or defense corporation who often make salaries in the high five or six figures when i did such work in 2008 as a single 35 year old who s seemingly only qualification was that i had been a captain in the marines my salary and benefits came close to 120 000 when i joined the state department in 2009 i didn t take a pay cut while an entry level position with that same dod contracting company the requirements of which were to simply possess a secret level security clearance and to know microsoft office was more than 80 000 as you can see it is very easy to slip into those golden handcuffs what this calculates to and remember aside from national and homeland security the federal government has decreased non defense discretionary spending in real terms since 2001 is that the washington dc metro area is the wealthiest part of the country and has been for a number of years beginning after these unending wars and their mass profits began while you can argue correlation is not causation the symbiotic nature cannot be denied between the unending nature of the wars and the massive increase in wealth for washington dc and its people and organs observe the loud protestation by the us senate towards the idea of the us wars in afghanistan and syria ending to get a glimpse of the fear that exists in washington and within the war machine towards just the idea or concept of peace if you want to understand why these wars continue and why these lies persist then you must understand the money that sustains and underlies both the war and its lies there have not been hard won gains by the us military in afghanistan for all these costs particularly the bloody expenditure of lives the war remains the same as it was in 2009 neither side can win and neither side will surrender us proclamations of military success and hard won gains are specious and are just one of the ever present lies of war reviewing department of defense data on the war since 2009 shows the taliban never weakened in strength at any time as us and nato and then afghan forces increased in number taliban strength and attacks increased commensurately roadside bombs mortar and rocket attacks assassinations etc by nearly every metric the taliban gained in strength and capability every year since president obama s surge at some point if the us had achieved military success over the taliban the taliban s ability to operate on the battlefield should have been impacted and their ability to launch attacks limited but the true impact of the presence of increased us nato and afghan government forces was to add purpose and motivation to a predominately anti occupation rural pashtun insurgency if one looks at us casualty data us casualties increased as more us troops arrived which is what one would expect as more troops go into combat more will be killed and wounded however against the assurances of the military and civilian experts in washington dc who promoted the counter insurgency doctrine whose adherents in many ways honestly resemble cult members casualties never decreased due to battlefield success casualties only decreased as a result of a decrease in us presence so as us troops went into a valley or village they met resistance and took casualties and that combat and those casualties never stopped the taliban and its supporters were never defeated no area was ever truly pacified subdued or came over to the side of the us and afghan government in a memorable passage of bob woodward s book obama s wars a skeptical president obama noted this reality and pushed back on his generals and advisors wherever us troops arrived in afghanistan they were met with a resistance that was never fully defeated quieted possibly for a limited amount of time but never defeated as i visited small and large bases in 2009 us army officers told me in both eastern and southern afghanistan the only land they held was the land that was covered by their machine guns and mortars the insurgency controlled the land and the population in many places it was relayed to me that the taliban welcomed the presence of us troops because with the presence of the us troops came millions of dollars in us military and usaid spending spending that went right into the pockets of the taliban this lack of control of the land and population remained true for the duration of us and nato forces in their positions as an occupation force and remains true for the afghan government forces which continue to be nearly in total non pashtun and serve as occupation force of outsiders themselves one example of many i can give of how the afghan security forces are seen as outsiders and occupiers in southern and eastern afghanistan and other pashtun parts of the country is of the seven senior afghan army officers in zabul province only 2 spoke pashto and could communicate with the near 100 pashtun population ana did not stand for the afghan national army but rather for the army of the northern alliance the force the taliban was fighting in 2001 and who the us put into power after overthrowing the taliban while it was repeated year after year authoritatively to congress that the ana was ethnically and regionally representative of afghanistan s population the truth is only about 4 of the afghan national army and police forces were composed of southern pashtuns the people from whom the taliban received the base of their support and the part of afghanistan were the fighting has been the worst i know of no evidence that shows the afghan army is any more representative of the pashtun population now as it has been over the last seventeen years as us and nato forces withdrew from the fighting in 2013 and 2014 the taliban turned their focus on the afghan security forces more than 45 000 afghan soldiers and police have been killed since 2014 while last fall it was reported fighting has intensified so that nearly 60 afghan soldiers and police are killed each day these deaths primarily come not against an outside enemy or groups of revolutionary religious fanatics but mainly against a taliban that is composed of locally organized and recruited insurgent forces who are fighting against foreign occupation and a corrupt predatory and non representative government that us european and afghan troops have died and been wounded in the hundreds of thousands in a civil war has been well understood by the us military and intelligence agencies even if it has been ignored by the us politicians and media the same was true of iraq of course as well as nearly any of the fourteen countries the us has sent its young men and women to kill and be killed in the people we are fighting are fighting us because we are occupying their countries and supporting violent repressive and corrupt governments when i was in kabul members of the us embassy located in the center of kabul behind ring after ring of checkpoints and concrete walls were not allowed to cross the street to the usaid compound on the other side of the road because it was not safe enough we had to walk beneath the street through a tunnel now members of the us embassy can not even travel via armored vehicles to the airport just a couple of miles away but must travel by helicopter naturally via a privately contracted helicopter force and this is in kabul not in the rural provinces where the taliban have their base of support the only success achieved by the us military since the obama surge has been the expansion of the war itself and the accompanying logistical accomplishment of moving so many people machines and stuff into and out of a mountainous and rural landlocked nation with a demolished infrastructure a result of the decades of fighting supported or taken part in by the us for nearly all of the four decades of war and again instigated by the us before the soviet union invaded the idea of military success and hard won gains has been nothing but craven and homicidal war propaganda trumpeted by us generals and the world s largest public relations operation and bleated obediently by politicians and shamefully journalists the pentagon spends almost 5 billion a year on recruiting public relations and psychological operations by comparison the largest public relations company in the world had annual fees for all of its clients of less than 900 million the us has not brought progress to afghanistan like a diseased onion claims the us has brought progress to afghanistan constitute another layer of the great lie of war as the us special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction sigar has shown in report after report the more than 130 billion spent on reconstruction in afghanistan more than what the us spent on the marshall plan to rebuild europe after world war two in inflation adjusted dollars has been a huge bust billions of dollars in cash have been overtly stolen by afghan government officials and cronies in 2012 more than 4 5 billion in cash was taken directly out of the airport in kabul while famously in 2009 shortly after i resigned from my position in afghanistan afghanistan s vice president landed in dubai with more than 50 million in cash in his luggage 74 us and nato troops died that month the claims of millions of school children now attending school including millions of girls have been exposed to just be made up numbers the great majority of schools and healthcare centers that were supposedly built as much as maybe 80 of them don t exist can t be found or are empty while the triumphant claim that life expectancy for afghans increased by twenty years has shown to be in the words of the sigar director john sopko baloney similarly the idea afghan women are better off now than under the taliban exists more in public relations statements than it does in reality for many afghan women while the lives of women under taliban rule was horrific and in some places in afghanistan such as parts of kabul women have experienced much better lives the truth is the attitudes and actions towards women of many of the men the us put and kept in power after 2001 were and are not much different than the taliban many of the rules the taliban enforced against women such as the requirement to wear a head to toe burqa had been put in place by the misogynist leaders of the groups the taliban were fighting in the 1990s again the people the us put into power after 2001 under the karzai and ghani administrations women have committed mass numbers of suicides including through self immolation in areas controlled by the afghan government due to laws put in place by the government including laws allowing men to legally rape their wives and by a society were nearly 90 of afghan women experience domestic violence ultimately it is women who suffer the most in war and all the slogans put forth by the war s apologists about how much they care about women can not overcome the truth that millions of afghan women must deal with the consequences actual or potential of the hot iron lead and metal that tears apart the flesh and lives of their children if the generals spokespeople and think tank experts almost all of whom are funded directly or indirectly by the defense industry were so interested in the welfare of women in afghanistan they would be working to end the violence that terrorizes ruins and ends the lives of those women and their children and prohibits any development or progress including advancements in women s rights from occurring those we have put and kept in power in afghanistan constitute a brutal kleptocracy besides the pentagon and the defense companies and al qaeda and isis the only other people who have benefited from the wars since 2001 have been the corrupt leaders we have put and kept in power in places like afghanistan every afghan election has been thoroughly fraudulent and riddled with vote rigging and ballot theft on a mass scale the last presidential election in 2014 was so crooked that an extra constitutional position of co president was created to prevent a civil war erupting amongst the afghan constituencies that support the government while in the most recent parliamentary elections more than three months ago now the irregularities were so blatant results still have not been released i personally witnessed the 2009 afghan presidential election tens of thousands of us and nato troops were rushed to afghanistan prior to the election to ensure a free and fair contest in the late spring and summer prior to those elections hundreds of them died and thousands more were wounded many of them permanently how many thousands of afghans died we will never know the pashtun people in southern and eastern afghanistan just as the sunni iraqis did in 2004 another electoral charade i was present for boycotted the election although us officials would say they did not vote because of security concerns i ended up that day at an afghan army base where an unauthorized polling location had been opened at the last minute just one of many irregularities that day the boxes were stuffed by obedient soldiers my report of this back to the embassy in kabul was disregarded because this was not an official voting location so such ballot stuffing did not count the logic that supports many of the lies of the war would be impossible to make up if such logic and its realizations did not actually exist later that day i would overhear through my translator the afghan brigade commander for the province telephone a subordinate and order his soldiers to conduct the same ballot stuffing the vote theft was brazen and the dead numbered in the thousands and the same has occurred for every election and every year of our occupation in afghanistan meanwhile the afghan government and military have been the key figures in the afghan drug trade not just the taliban indeed much of the fighting over the last many years in places like helmand province can be attributed to a battle for control over the vast tracts of poppy fields the drug trade is not confined to low or local levels of the military and the police but has extended and continues to extend to the most senior men in government and this has been evident throughout the duration of our occupation of afghanistan when i was in afghanistan the biggest drug baron in southern afghanistan was president karzai s brother ahmed wali karzai awk the biggest in eastern afghanistan was the governor of nangahar province gul agha sherzai in the north various warlords the us worked with ran the drug trade including the governor of balkh province atta mohammad noor and in kabul mohammed qasim marshall fahim for whom the afghan military officers training academy is now named and who was the afghan vice president was famous for using afghan military aircraft to transport drugs out of afghanistan sherzai now the minister of border and tribal affairs and noor still control their drug fiefdoms while awk and fahim are dead but have been replaced by drug syndicates within the afghan government the detailing of the criminality and gangsterism of the afghan government is endless maybe best described by the general rashid dostum president ghani s vice president who is accused of massive war crimes in the years following 9 11 and who was forced to flee afghanistan in 2017 after kidnapping and raping a political opponent sherzai serves as a good case study for the insanity of the us war in afghanistan in the early 1990s sherzai ruled as a warlord governor in kandahar his barbaric rule can be counted as one of the defining factors in the rise of the taliban after 1994 the taliban received a great deal of popular support as an antidote to the murder rape and banditry of the warlords in 2001 after the us ousted the taliban the us put sherzai back in power in kandahar the very man who s brutality helped create the taliban we placed back in power sherzai s rule was again murderous and was now supplemented by american soldiers and money sarah chayes the former npr correspondent gives a heartbreaking detailing of sherzai s rule in her masterful the punishment of virtue sherzai would follow on his rule in kandahar with time in kabul as the minister of housing and minister of public works before becoming governor of economically important nangahar province on the pakistan border nangahar along with kandahar had traditionally been a large source of poppy production for the narcotics trade at this time when i met him sherzai s corruption and use of torture and violence as well as his keeping of dancing boys young slaves used for sexual pleasure and dominance was well known by the us government this however was shrugged off in kabul and washington with cavalier and smug excuses that war is a dirty business sherzai who was invited and attended barack obama s inauguration in 2009 as an official guest cultivated a romanticized following among officials within the state department and us embassy who adoringly and reverentially viewed him as a tony soprano like figure he was the very embodiment of the dark side dick cheney had advocating embracing sherzai who resided in the former summer palace of the afghan kings in jalalabad was indeed charming and gracious i met him twice but he knew full well the manipulation and control he had over the us government there was a poppy eradication program in place in 2009 one of many programs that have constituted the nearly 10 billion spent on drug eradication efforts in afghanistan the cost has been more than just financial one of my friends a fellow company commander in the marine corps michael weston was killed in afghanistan while posted there as a dea agent this program in particular offered 10 million in cash to governors who succeeded in eradicating a certain level of poppy crop sherzai through his family and due to his lingering power in kandahar had significant poppy field holdings and drug trade involvement in southern afghanistan now with the backing of the afghan and us governments and the dea sherzai was able to muscle his competition in eastern afghanistan those who wanted to cooperate with him in their poppy production and drug trafficking could survive those who did not want to pay him had their fields eradicated utilizing afghan and us resources sherzai could co opt or destroy his competition and was rewarded for doing so with 10 million courtesy of us taxpayers i am quite certain this happened multiple years to make the claim that we are supporting the guys in the white hats in afghanistan even more criminally ludicrous the afghan security forces be it the army the police or the intelligence services consistently torture prisoners as a matter of routine practice in addition to being themselves involved in the drug trade this has unsurprisingly received not very much attention from the us congress and press what has received attention but for which little has been done except for the us issuing actual and de facto waivers to the government of afghanistan and its security forces for the leahy amendment and child soldiers prevention act has been the widespread keeping of child sex slaves by afghan military and police officers some us military personnel so disgusted by the overt keeping of child sex slaves took matters into their own hands only to be relieved of command and forced out of the military for us generals and the congress afghan military and police officers keeping child sex slaves is entirely worth the end purposes of the good war whatever end purposes those may be as vonnegut said so it goes afghanistan as a necessary safe haven for another 9 11 is a myth the most fervent argument against peace the one that has carried forth the us war in afghanistan from its start in 2001 has been that a military presence and the requisite massive land war is necessary to prevent another 9 11 how quick are the facts of 9 11 and al qaeda forgotten and how easily jettisoned is critical thought when this argument is offered and accepted first none of the hijackers involved in the september 11 attacks were afghans nor was anyone involved in the planning or logistics more so the attacks were led and planned primarily in pakistan and germany training and planning did occur in camps in afghanistan but khaled sheik mohammad ksm the mastermind of the attacks was based in pakistan and that is where he did the majority of his planning and training while the leadership of the hijackers lived and planned in hamburg germany in what was known as the kitchen of the september 11 operation ksm was captured in rawalpindi pakistan the same town as the pakistani military headquarters osama bin laden was of course killed in abbottabad the same town as the pakistani military academy the man responsible for the logistics of the 9 11 operation never left germany until a few days before the attacks additional planning and preparations took place in malaysia spain and possibly dubai of course the most important safe havens for the hijackers were the us flight schools and martial arts gyms they attended while in the us it s important to remember that some of the attackers were in the us for more than 18 months before the 9 11 attacks and that it seems all of the attackers spent more time in the us than they did in afghanistan or pakistan not that it matters much where the attackers planned and trained as planning and training for these types of attacks requires nothing more than an apartment hotel room or basement understanding these attacks and what actually goes into them exposes the idea of the necessity of safe havens as nothing more than a necessary myth to propagate the global war on terror or as the pentagon likes to call it the long war which along with the greater middle east also now includes russia and china in us war plans none of the arguments for war in afghanistan to prevent another 9 11 speak of the well defined role of saudi arabia and possibly dubai in financing and facilitating the attacks without the saudi involvement in particular the attacks would have been impossible those who utilize 9 11 to fear monger in an attempt to silence critics of the war or proponents of peace brazenly neglect the failure the wars have been on and after 9 11 al qaeda was between 200 and 400 people strong worldwide over the last seventeen years al qaeda and its successor isis has grown to number in the tens of thousands with branches and affiliates across the globe today the us is in combat operations in fourteen countries while conducting counter terrorism operations in sixty five countries to ostensibly defeat al qaeda and isis bombing that kills maims and make homeless tens of thousands each year from us aircraft and drones is daily in not just afghanistan and iraq but in libya pakistan somalia syria and yemen countries across the middle east and africa most especially libya somalia syria and yemen have been torn apart by civil wars and fighting that have at least some if not all of their genesis in us military and cia activities since 2001 at times al qaeda isis and their allies have controlled and commanded large swathes of land including major cities threatened to overthrow governments in nations both aligned and unaligned to the us and committed mass scale atrocities and genocide how can any person with any degree of intellectual honesty look at the us strategy and operations against al qaeda and terrorism over the last decade and a half and argue that more of the same is what is required peace has been possible in afghanistan what has been said repeatedly since 2001 regarding the taliban is that they have been uninterested in peace talks or negotiations this is untrue yes there are some elements of the taliban which have been against peace talks and negotiation but there have been many members and parts of the taliban that have been interested in talking however this goes against the profit benefits of an unending war as well as the political need for president obama to be not just a war time president but a victorious war time president something the george w bush and the republicans could not claim see bob woodward s obama wars and refer to hillary clinton and her hawkish role as secretary of state as a necessary part of her pre campaign for president pushing for war in not just afghanistan but in libya as well in the immediate aftermath of the us invasion major figures and parts of the taliban sought to surrender they were rebuffed as it was victory that was being sought by the us and their afghan warlord allies not reconciliation and peace in the years following 2001 members of the taliban who sought to surrender and reconcile were instead hunted down and killed those who were not killed were forced across the border into pakistan or iran anand gopal s reporting on this is excellent and necessary for understanding how the afghan war came to be unending post 2001 in the final years of the bush presidency and in the first year or two of obama s presidency the taliban made overtures to peace and negotiations middle eastern and central and south asian media reported the taliban interest in talks but these reports were rarely if ever picked up by western media the taliban suggested negotiations via social media including facebook posts and mullah omar the leader of the taliban in his annual eid messages would include comments about beginning a process of talks to lead to peace and reconciliation these overtures accompanied with the demand for foreign forces to leave an understandable call by an insurgency continued even after the us escalation of the war in 2009 none of this was even acknowledged let alone considered by the us government in 2016 the new york times whose editorial page has been a continual supporter of the war over the last seventeen years until just this month reported that in 2007 and 2008 norwegian negotiators had been meeting directly with mullah omar until this reporting it had been believed mullah omar had never met with any westerner and that a framework for peace was being advanced this opportunity was scuttled in 2009 by the obama administration s escalation of the war an escalation that was justified by president obama because according to him and the us government the taliban were not interested in peace sherard cowper coles britain s ambassador and special representative to afghanistan from 2007 to 2010 whom i met in richard holbrooke s suite at the waldorf astoria in new york city in 2009 and who praised me for my resignation letter described the main impediment to negotiations during his many year tenure in afghanistan as the american military and the reality of the american republic cowper coles after leaving afghanistan experienced an appalling sense of sadness and tragedy and above all the sense that otherwise intelligent people were living one big bright shining lie during my time in afghanistan i first hand saw a willingness to negotiate by elements of the taliban while in nangahar province in the spring of 2009 we were approached by representatives of hezbi islami gulbuddin one of three principal blocks of the taliban the taliban is not monolithic and is composed of dozens if not hundreds of locally organized insurgencies that fall under the umbrella of larger regional insurgencies whose leadership is based in pakistan which are then included under the overall broader designation that we call the taliban my instruction from the embassy was clear disregard we do not negotiate or are involved with reconciliation reconciliation according to the us government was only to be conducted by the afghan government a government that only existed and remained in power due to the backing of the us and nato so because of this backing from the world s lone superpower it was a government that was never going to willingly negotiate on its own why would it again the logic that sustains the lies of the war is brilliant in its speciousness on multiple occasions interlocutors from the insurgency were rebuffed and when us army commanders asked about how the war ends without negotiation they received no answer later in my time in afghanistan i moved to the southern province of zabul here too i met with taliban interlocutors and more than likely some taliban themselves my instructions were the same do nothing throughout the war the us has insisted on three preconditions for the taliban prior to talks 1 lay down their weapons 2 renounce links to al qaeda and 3 embrace the afghan constitution renouncing their links to al qaeda the taliban have done in one form or another since 2001 just as the taliban put out feelers for talks in the middle eastern and central south asian press that were never acknowledged by the us government so has their renunciation of ties to al qaeda been ignored the remaining two preconditions if followed by the taliban would in effect have meant their surrender as i was told several times in zabul when discussing with interlocutors and again maybe the taliban themselves and has been repeated to me by men in the us with ties to the taliban we are tired of fighting my father fought and now my sons are fighting i do not want my grandsons to fight but we are not going to surrender couple this with the fact that it was not until eleven years after the us invasion that taliban were allowed safe passage to negotiate meaning that if they identified themselves they would find their vehicle the target of a drone and its hellfire missiles and even in the last few years they have been consistently targeted and it is clear that us protestations for a willingness and a desire for peace may well have been the grandest and bloodiest lie of them all peace cut through all the lies and there it is right in front of you it is true that there are hundreds of thousands of well paid men and women in the us because of this war many of whom can now afford beach homes and bmws and yes it is true there are hundreds of politicians who subsist on the unholy campaign contributions that come from the war machine aside from these mercenary beneficiaries can someone point to any thing worthwhile from these wars what should be apparent to observers of the war in afghanistan is that the willingness for peace from the us and its allies has not existed the reasons are multiple there is too much money being made the political advantages of a victory presidency are too great the vainglorious egos of the generals and those in think tanks backed financially by the defense industry are too strong there may be a great deal of money in minerals to be made in afghanistan while the yearly record amounts of drugs grown and exported are enriching the afghan government and security forces as well as local regional and international banks and if you are the corrupt decadent afghan government with the us as your benefactor why seek peace what should also be clear and damning is how quickly and easily the recent peace talks have moved forward with seemingly minimal effort over the span of a few meetings a framework for peace appears possible all that tragically seems to have been required was the willingness of the us government to talk what a waste the saddest epilogue to this essay and to this war is that none of this was necessary it has all has been a waste blood flesh bone sinew organs ground up and thrown as if by some spectral ghastly hand and shovel into a furnace of oblivion and nothingness eb sledge a us marine who fought in the 20th century s good war wrote about his experiences as an infantryman amidst all the killing and dying in with the old breed

review and preview the world economy is slowing very rapidly and therefore monetary policy everywhere will be eased so the outlook is a lot more inflationary helping gold said alasdair macleod head of research at goldmoney com gold scales 2 week peak reuters february 15 2019 stocks continued their torrid rally last week to new highs for 2019 in u s indices the dow jones industrial average for instance closed at 25 883 up 777 points for the week and 443 points on friday alone and this was in spite of president trump s mars uranus conjunction surprise announcement that he will issue an executive order to build the wall to a mundane astrologer this was practically a given with saturn in capricorn 2018 2020 and both ruling walls however that was not the real reason why equities rallied so strongly it had more to do with the encouraging news on trade talks between the u s and china which astrologically pertains to jupiter in sagittarius both the planet and the sign rule world trade they too will likely come to some sort of an agreement soon although with jupiter square neptune the spin on the agreement may be much greater than the reality of what it actually delivers or can be enforced in europe the netherlands aex zurich smi and london ftse indices all spared to new highs for 2019 last week but the german dax did not for a potential case of intermarket bearish divergence in an mma critical reversal zone in the far east it was also a mixed bag china s shanghai composite hong kong s hang seng and tokyo s nikkei all rallied to new highs for 2019 australia s asx just missed whereas india s nifty index was one of the few markets that plummeted last week in the america s the s p djia and nasdaq all made new highs for the year while argentina s merval index exploded for a new all time high brazil s bovespa was up but not quite to a new all time high in other markets gold silver the euro and the yen all fell to a multi week low on february 14 crude oil like many stock indices rallied to a new high for this year bitcoin started the week off quite strong but then turned sideways again hovering around 3550 by friday s close short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts the national debt surpasses 22 trillion for the first time on tuesday february 12 a milestone that experts warned is further proof the country is on an unsustainable path that could jeopardize the economic security of every american the national debt has been rising at a faster rate following the passage of president donald trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut package a little more than a year ago over time this can push up interest rates for consumers and businesses nudging up rates for mortgages corporate bonds and other types of consumer and business loans michael collins national debt tops 22 trillion for firth time usa today february 14 2019 there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics attributed to benjamin disraeli by mark twin in chapters from my autobiography north american review no dcxviii july 5 1907 it is just the nature of jupiter in sagittarius square neptune in pisces everything has a nuance to it and that nuance is usually dictated by the tendency to exaggerate which falls under the domain of jupiter and its ruling sign of sagittarius add to this the tendency to give out incorrect facts misleading information and inaccurate narratives that have a hidden agenda to divert attention away from what is really important and you get an idea of the collective psychological climate we are in this year in terms of market psychology this is the juice that can lead to irrational exuberance wishful thinking and a proclivity towards thinking everything is wonderful when really it is at best uncertain unknown and confusing markets may rally or fall in extremes with no rational basis behind it we saw this in december when equity markets fell very hard and we are probably seeing it now as equity markets rally for 8 consecutive weeks to a financial astrologer it all fits into the storyline of jupiter square neptune with each planet in its ruling sign at some point reality will hit such as the reality that the debt issue is not under control that wakeup call is coming soon probably in 2020 as the jupiter neptune square gives way to the capricorn stellium when jupiter saturn pluto and the moon s south node will travel through capricorn and conjoin one another if sagittarius exaggerates then capricorn is much more critical and discerning underestimating and preparing for the worst instead of overestimating and assuming the best this year 2019 is the setup for what we will experience collectively in 2020 2021 it is a switch from seeing the glass half full to seeing it half empty maybe almost empty we may get a glimpse of this future reality this week venus will conjoin both saturn and pluto february 18 22 which is a preview of what we will see when saturn and pluto actually enter their conjunction on january 12 2020 this week s conjunction of venus saturn and pluto follows the time last month when venus was conjunct jupiter and square neptune january 20 22 these translations of venus over first the jupiter neptune square and then the saturn pluto conjunction is a symbolic preview of the greater picture of jupiter square neptune january september 2019 followed by the saturn pluto conjunction in january 2020 with an effect lasting through much of 2020 as you can see first the market was up and now let s see if we get a pull back from the venus saturn pluto conjunction this coming week an even more important translation to the same set of aspects will follow with the sun in march and april that is the sun will conjunct neptune and square jupiter march 6 13 and then head for a square to both saturn and pluto april 10 13 thus this period offers another preview of what is to come if not specifically in terms of market behavior then in terms of political and economic scenarios that is first hopes and wishes perhaps tinged with delusionary visions of what could be followed by a smack in the face with cold reality probably related to debt issues it is very interesting to see the increasing attention being created for many socialistic policies like free college education guaranteed minimum annual payments by the government to everyone even if you don t work to medicare for all at the same time the national debt is reported to exceed 22 trillion this parallel realities is taking place as we leave the first venus translation of jupiter and neptune wishes hopes delusionary visions and approach the venus conjunction to saturn and pluto hard cold reality involving debt this week the tax cut pluto did not create the increase in revenues for the u s treasury expected but i suspect all that will be forgotten soon as we approach the sun s translation to jupiter neptune square in march until we get to april when the debt level again reaches a point of greater concern and makes headlines each translation of jupiter neptune by a faster moving planet followed by that same planet s translation of saturn and pluto soon afterwards is likely to exhibit this pattern first optimism based on hopes and wishes then worry based on how can we afford this with such debt this back and forth pattern progresses to less and less optimism and more and more concern the closer we get to 2020 the danger for traders and investors is that they become complacent because every downturn in the market is still followed by healthy rallies until jupiter and neptune finally separate after september the danger for governments institutions companies and individuals is that if not careful they may be headed for a credit crisis such as bankruptcy classical jupiter neptune occurrences where they spend far beyond what they can afford falsely believing that everything is ok and will work out it is important to understand this dynamic it may be hard to identify the exact turns in financial markets these days especially if you don t use geocosmic indicators however if you understand the collective psychology that is taking place you can see why this type of pattern and this probability of increasing investor complacency can be a setup to a rather dangerous market climate that could very well be approaching it is a reason why investors are advised to start thinking about how they can move from market risk to cash or certain commodities if not done already for when the psychological bubble of complacency breaks cash will be king that s usually the way things go when saturn enters hard aspect to pluto and uranus within a year of one another which will take place in 2020 2021 for the first time since 2008 2010 and 2000 2002 before that for more insight on these matters consider getting a copy of last week s forecast 2019 webinar it went very well and so did the recording with the power point slides that go along with this recording these points are illustrated clearly much more clearly than one might expect in these times with jupiter square neptune
in august september last year much of the commentary about a decade of the global financial crisis of 2008 featured the global recovery and the rebound in the united states economy the bounce back was strong enough for the us federal reserve to signal two rate cuts in 2019 and for global central banks to give notice that a prolonged phase of easy money was coming to an end did all of them speak a little too soon a few days ago nobel laureate paul krugman sounded a warning in dubai when he told bloomberg that the world s biggest economy the us could be heading for a recession late in 2019 or in 2020 i couldn t be definitive but it seems pretty likely he said what is the ground for such fears according to krugman the us is in worse shape than it was in 2008 what the economist was apparently referring to is the country s huge public debt which at a little over 22 trillion has been growing over the last few years and debt to gdp ratio a measure of the ability of a country to repay debt rising to 104 now he is looking at a recession also because of the slowdown in europe where economic powerhouse germany has been hit because of tariff wars involving the us and china a recession in italy and slowing growth in france advertisement europe is clearly experiencing a slowdown to recessionary levels already and has no recourse draghi chief of the european central bank ecb can t cut rates because they are negative already so i think europe is in a danger spot potentially as big as china krugman told bloomberg the worry regarding china is the trade war with the us which if not settled could dampen growth or stoke a recession according to some the other reason for krugman to be downbeat is the current us leadership including the us treasury secretary whom he contrasts with the remarkable leadership during the 2008 global financial crisis the pessimism also stems from krugman s reading as well as that of another doomsday predictor economist nouriel roubini who wrote in september 2018 in project syndicate that in 2020 conditions would be ripe for a financial crisis followed by a global recession like krugman roubini also believes that trade disputes an unsustainable stimulus and a massive public debt will leave little room for a stimulus the next time around that is because the top central banks of the world may not have the firepower to cushion the impact of a recession having bought massively into bonds and other assets during the global financial crisis to combat that and to ensure easy money in short what the doomsday predictions point to is that the top global central banks may not have the policy tools to provide easy liquidity given the liabilities on their balance sheets are the fears overblown advertisement us president donald trump may still be euphoric about the world s biggest economy at a growth of 4 but it is interesting to weigh what jerome powell the chairman of the us federal reserve the world s most powerful central bank had to say in january at the annual meeting of the american economic association where he was flanked by two of his predecessors janet yellen and ben bernanke the us economy is in strong shape but the market was pricing in downside risks that weren t visible yet according to powell inflation is still muted and the jobs or labour market is still strong with high frequency data yet to mirror some of these worries and with asset prices picking up the monetary policy of the european central bank or the bank of england too is accommodative at this point a far cry from the time last year when most bets were on them moving towards raising interest rates the normalisation of policy or a return to the policy before the era of cheap money dating to 2008 appears to be a couple of quarters away advertisement krugman and roubini may not be convinced but powell said last month that the us federal reserve will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and to use all its policy tools to support the economy should that be appropriate to keep expansion on track the labour market strong and inflation close to 2 what he has indicated is that the central bank will be on course to change tack as it did in 2016 when after signalling the possibility of multiple rate increases it settled for just one because of the underlying economic conditions could the predictions be wrong roubini who earned the name dr doom after famously calling the 2008 housing bubble in the us is seen as being cynical for those worried about the forecasts of a perfect storm in 2020 there may be some comfort krugman himself admits that he has been wrong in the past my track record is bad cnbc has quoted him as saying for india data and forecasts are presented on a fiscal year basis and gdp from 2011 onward is based on gdp at market prices with fy2011 12 as a base year source imf where does all that leave india an upside of the current scenario marked by low interest rates and an accommodative policy of central banks and low inflation will be that the rbi could have more room for cutting interest rates further oil prices a major threat to macroeconomic stability have been relatively low foreign flows have ebbed for quite a while with domestic investors putting money into stocks and mutual funds that has also seen a slide but once the political uncertainty is over after the lok sabha polls and there is clarity on policies and the direction of reforms and measures to address agrarian distress the tide could change that would also be contingent on getting the fisc back in shape and any near term impact in the wake of the terrorist attack in kashmir
neoliberalism the little understood and misguided economic dogma that has dominated the last four decades since the late 1970 s the economic doctrine of neoliberalism has dominated the policy decisions of politicians on both sides of the partisan aisle neoliberalism began as a sincere dogma that expressed doubt in the public sector and instead put trust in rational markets private institutions and the self interested individual the atrocities of authoritarian communism provided validation for this world view and the soviet union s collapse ignited the worldwide proliferation of free market policies but in time this ideology would prove itself to be a cynical masquerade for the subversion of popular democracy and the enabling of predatory capitalism and monopoly control of government adherents of neoliberalism sought to eliminate all restraints on capital accumulation including environmental financial and labor regulations through trade deals like nafta corporations were given free rein to race for the bottom in global labor standards replacing domestic workers with foreigners who did not legally require a minimum wage healthcare and other basic standards the freedom of fair opportunity was replaced by the radical freedom to disregard basic moral norms in the pursuit of profit undoubtedly free enterprise is an essential element of any prosperous society but the total removal of restraints on capital has led to environmental destruction disenfranchised workers and an unhinged finance sector furthermore many technological breakthroughs were developed with federal grants such as the internet through darpa the micro chip technology that composes the iphone and medical breakthroughs through the national institute of health technology that was developed generationally and collectively disproportionately serves monopolists through patents as the taxes that would serve to reciprocate the societal contributions that have benefitted companies like google or apple are largely avoided through offshore tax havens and convoluted accounting strategies while neoliberals cite classical liberals such as adam smith and john stuart mill as like minded forefathers there is a tremendous distinction between the ideas offered in the wealth of nations and the policies initiated by ronald reagan and margaret thatcher classical liberals distinguished between productive and unproductive labor or rent seeking modern rent seeking is demonstrated in deceptive financial fees student loan interest and huge health insurance costs rent seeking is also evident in monopoly profits as a corporation with total market control can hike prices in the absence of competition a glaring example is evident in american pharmaceuticals twice as expensive as equivalents in other wealthy countries according to the economist two thirds of all american industries were more concentrated in 2012 than in 1997 our government funded the consolidation of jp morgan chase with bear stearns and washington mutual the merger of wells fargo with wachovia and bank of america s amalgamation with merrill lynch and countrywide financial after the recession the two largest pharmaceutical giants pfizer and merck were permitted to absorb drug companies wyeth and schering plough eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the process failure to enforce antitrust legislation has allowed mega corporations like exxonmobil and jpmorgan chase to dictate public policy and secure regulatory advantages that stifle competition in a true capitalist system corporations have the freedom to fail in our system too big to fail banks hold such an outsized share of the market their failure would allegedly jeopardize the entire economy but instead of breaking up the banks after the recession the government made them bigger and richer and while bankers were alleviated from the consequences of their risky loans the average american citizen is more indebted than ever shareholder theory another principle tenet of neoliberalism is the prioritization of shareholder returns shareholder theory is based on the idea that shareholders must be compensated first because they provide the investment needed for a business to grow but as economist william lazonick has shown many shareholders are just short term speculators who are seeking a quick profit without long term investment the real foundations of a corporation s success are taxpayers who provide infrastructure and knowledge and workers who perform the company s necessary operations our tax code and pay scale must be restructured to reward the people who are creating value neoliberalism and corporate buybacks perhaps the most dysfunctional trend enabled by shareholder theory is corporate buybacks buybacks refer to a company purchasing its own stock to artificially boost share prices and pay quick dividends to investors with near zero interest capital on tap from the fed major corporations have taken on huge debt loads to continue an unsustainable system of buying their own stock instead of investing in long term success through research development which still hasn t returned to pre 2008 levels the consequences of buybacks can be demonstrated by walmart in 2016 the retailing giant spent 8 3 billion in buybacks while taxpayers paid out 6 billion to assist employees with food stamps and public housing furthermore executives are paid heavily in stock options making buybacks an incentivized form of self enrichment buybacks were illegal and designated as market manipulation until 1982 they are now the mainstream in corporate america breaking a new record at 1 1 trillion in 2018 according to financial times columnist rana foroohar buybacks securities and other financial products make up about 85 of money circulated by major financial institutions in the closed loop of the market while only around 15 of their capital is lent to businesses that support the real economy eighty four percent of stock is held by ten percent of the population the stock market can reach record highs while the actual economy stagnates and wages remain flat contradicting the original vision of adam smith who envisioned finance serving a supportive role to business the finance sector has taken an extremely oversized role in the economy creating only four percent of jobs while taking in 25 percent of corporate profits the unsustainability of shareholder theory can be further demonstrated by the different spending behavior of public and private companies public companies which are beholden to shareholder theory spend half as much as private companies on research development worker education and other forms of long term value creating investment the pressure to maintain endless quarterly growth has encouraged public companies to engage in the buyback frenzy of the last few decades depriving our real economic engine taxpayers workers and innovative research in the process trickle down economics tax cuts on the top socioeconomic class sometimes referred to as supply side or trickle down economics is another core pillar of market orthodoxy the theory is that the super wealthy are job creators who will use their savings to invest in the economy and that low corporate taxes attract businesses if supply side economics worked tax havens like ireland and the cayman islands would be growing prosperous from apple and google using them to avoid federal taxes and high tax countries like norway or germany would be desolate high tax states like new york and california perform far better than low tax states like missouri or kansas because a skilled work force and quality infrastructure are more important factors in attracting business and investment than low tax rates supply side economics also exacerbates the huge disparity between worker and executive compensation which has already been worsened by the destruction of labor unions corporate executives in the us compensate themselves 361 times more than the average worker even when they completely fail their jobs in the 1950 s that ratio was 20 1 ceos of the too big to fail banks gave themselves huge bonuses six months after receiving federal rescue funds from crashing the economy another example is sears in which the us bankruptcy court approved over 25 million in bonuses to executives even though they led their company into bankruptcy and laid off thousands of workers as lucian bebchuk and jesse fried show in their book pay without performance there is considerable and growing evidence that increasing ceo compensation has nothing to do with performance and is damaging pay structures throughout the economy neoliberalism and flawed economic indicators another major flaw in our economic system lies in the metrics we use to evaluate its success gdp gross domestic product measures the total goods and services produced by an economy but externalities such as infant mortality education health care and environmental destruction are completely absent from its analytical parameters incomes shrank for half the population in 1981 1984 and 1986 despite gdp growth during all of those years credit card companies make more profits from penalties than interest even though compound debt reduces people s ability to buy goods and services profit from credit card penalties is considered a financial service and is added to gdp gdp calculates profits from predatory rent seeking as growth even though they undermine the real economy and extract value instead of creating it neoliberalism shareholder theory buybacks monopolization supply side economics and over reliance on flawed metrics like gdp have contributed to the faltering and unbalanced economic condition of the last few decades entrepreneurship declined by 44 between 1978 and 2012 wage growth remains anemic we have the worst inequality since the great depression the market is an essential component of any functioning society but we must liberate our minds from ideological dogmatism in order to address these systemic flaws and create prosperity for the many instead of the few
dear china get ready for 25 tariffs kenneth rapoza senior contributor feb 17 2019 5 30 pm in two weeks china will probably be hit with 25 tariffs on 200 billion worth of goods if not by march 1 then after any trade truce ends supposedly 60 days later assuming an extension is still on the table the market is way too long on the china truce trade the dow jumped over 400 points to settle higher for the eighth straight week on friday president trump may see the gains as a sign that any pause in tariffs is welcomed on wall street and in theory cast aside the china hawks in his cabinet led by his trade representative robert lighthizer but consider this on friday trump spoke about the possibility of a trade deal with china during a rose garden press conference the main point of that presser was to talk about his decision to declare a national emergency at the border and fund his border wall without a congressional vote what was more interesting to the market was trump s trade war talk and saying he wants to include house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer in on a china trade deal any deal i make with china schumer s going to stand up and say oh it should have been better that s not acceptable to me trump said during the press conference so i m thinking about doing something very different i m going to bring schumer or at least offer schumer and pelosi to come with me and i m going to say join me on the deal he said schumer and pelosi are democratic party hawks on china pelosi was critical of china joining the world trade organization in the late 1990s china finally joined in 2001 the only thing schumer and trump see eye to eye on is china tariffs so either this is going to be a lousy deal and trump is going to tell the market look it s not just me it s all of us or this is going to create the bipartisan support needed to keep tariffs locked in on china long after trump is gone this seems to be lighthizer s thinking trump once again praised tariffs on friday he said the government was raking in billions of dollars from chinese tariffs imagine doubling those tariffs from the current level of 10 to 25 once the government gets addicted to that revenue what is going to stop them from removing it big business no they have petitioned the government for weeks now for exemptions to no avail wall street no wall street will get used to it after they pick the winners and losers an in the stock market and learn where the companies hardest hit are going to get product instead of china there will be some serious revaluation going on does this look like a stock fund that s scared of 25 tariffs almost overbought the deutsche x trackers china a shares etf seems to believe one of two things either the 10 tariffs that were once so terrible are no longer terrible or investors are doubtful that the trump administration doubles tariffs on chinese imports this year the only way that will push higher is if tariffs are removed and or xi jinping overstimulates his economy worth noting for china investors higher tariffs do not mean that china necessarily suffers great losses it can allow the market to lower the value of the yuan to make up for that cost and chinese manufacturers having grown exponentially over the last 20 years can relocate some of their product lines to other asian countries this shift has been taking place even before the first shots in the trade war were fired chinese manufacturers have been moving apparel shops to vietnam and bangladesh for instance some stitch and sew work is being moved into india if you get 25 tariffs the chinese economy will be under more pressure but that s a given says jin zhang a portfolio manager at vontobel asset management here in the u s companies like gm that have big businesses in china might be in a difficult situation and get beat up by the market you have to know what you own and try not to own companies that are in the crossfire he says we are underweight china what else can china do that is of interest to the u s while honestly protecting their made in china 2025 growth strategy and keeping their core economic policies in place there is no great deal in the works as trump continually hints is in the bag if there was great deal he would not want to share that success with pelosi and schumer meanwhile the market is continually told by people close to trump including larry kudlow that the gap between both sides remains a big one how is that closing anytime soon china s offer to host trump in hainan a tropical island in south china was rejected by the white house in favor of a meeting with president xi jinping at mar a lago in florida as one investor told me in a casual conversation on friday why go to hainan only to reject china s offer it s better to bring xi to the u s and say look this is what we are going to do china may actually be fine with tariffs here s why assuming sizable distance on key items up for debate namely subsidies by state owned enterprises to favorite enterprises especially in the advanced technology space if china wants to keep those in place they can in exchange for keeping that status quo china gets 25 duties china has already opened its market to items on washington s wish list namely financial services this will probably be expanded over time to payment service firms like visa and mastercard another positive for the american services trade with china american financial institutions are currently racing to set up shop in mainland china to tap the investor class there and help professionalize the mainland stock market as the msci index continues to increase the weighting of shanghai and shenzhen listed stocks in the massive msci emerging markets benchmark index u s firms will need equity analysts and other fundamental research on the ground to provide market insights to both chinese and global clients this is a very important market for american investment firms getting this market to open faster than originally planned without having to partner with a local firm can be chalked up as a positive for trump even though this move was in the works prior to the trade war china has also changed its intellectual property laws allowing u s firms to sue while they may not get a friendly court judge to rule in their favor the odds of washington being happy with that given all the theft of ip in the recent past are pretty slim companies will have to live with xi s pledge to toughen ip legal protections for all firms operating in china and that s that they will probably be fine with that too seeing how it is something they never had before it s a move in the right direction we can assume that xi is not going to make ip laws retroactive potentially opening the floodgates to american lawsuits against the country s best domestic companies for wrong doings prior to new laws still in the works seeing how china is unlikely to change the way its state owned firms operate to appease the u s and assuming they have gone as far as they will on intellectual property the only thing the u s can do is keep tariffs as they are or tell the chinese look we don t like the role your state firms play in the market and we are not happy with your ip laws so we are going to punish you with a 25 duty and we might even put tariffs on more products as we see fit the end china doesn t have to do anything other than continue talks with the u s about market access in hopes to alleviate the burden of some tariffs on some sectors but in the meantime the communist party doesn t have a deadline to make trump happy for that the price is 25 take it or leave it either the tariffs stay as they are or they go up it doesn t take a harvard m b a and 10 years at goldman sachs to figure that out but tariffs won t come down especially broadly over time sectors or product lines might get a reprieve as trade talks work themselves out the return of tariff man and the bizarre invitation to schumer and pelosi to share responsibility for the outcome of a xi summit are suggestive of a president leaning towards 25 tariffs on march 1 says bryan mccarthy chief strategist for macrolens a boutique investment research firm focusing on china the market will sell off the second investors reach the tipping point on this and see more tariffs as the likely outcome source forbes dear china

via gnseconomics the global slowdown has been much discussed lately a slowdown in europe and china was considered to be the main reason for the december stock market rout combined with the balance sheet normalization qt program of the federal reserve what is behind the slowdown no satisfactory answer has emerged though china s efforts to curb excessive lending are a natural candidate in addition to the fact that central banks have been removing stimulus the answer however goes deeper into the structure of modern economies we will show in the march issue of our q review that the world economy never actually recovered from the financial crisis and explain the reasons why the failure of the economic drivers of global growth china the eurozone and the us is at the heart of the non recovery we will delve into that here killing the spirit in june 2017 we noticed that something strange was going on in the global economy the growth of total factor productivity tfp had stagnated starting in 2011 this is something that should not happen in a growing economy tfp is the measure of that part of gdp growth that changes in the quality and quantity of investments and work force cannot explain it s generally thought to be the measure of technological change driving economic growth if it stagnates it means that production is not becoming more efficient that is the achieved production is just the sum of capital and labor stagnation thus implies that our ability to create productive innovations has halted a serious omen and yet this is exactly what has happened since 2011 why the three kings on a journey down when the global economy falters you turn to its leaders to look for blame at the end of 2017 china the euro area and the united states accounted for some 51 percent of the global gdp they were the undisputed engines of global growth after the gfc leaders of europe china and the united states enacted exceptional measures to save the global economy these kept many insolvent banks and companies operating thus intensifying the zombification of the global economy however the gfc also led to a fall in the investment rate in the euro area and in the us see figure 2 their gross formation of physical capital fell by several percentage points and it has never recovered we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the capital formation in china has kept its very high rate there however the problem is that investments have grown increasingly unproductive figure 3 shows the tfp growth of china the euro area and the us it shows that since 2011 the productivity of china has actually fallen despite heavy investment levels this has led to an even more intractable problem over indebtedness because the revenue from the investments has not been sufficient to service the debt figure 4 shows the combined private and government debt and the real gdp of china since 1995 from 1995 till 2007 the overall debt in china grew only fractionally faster than gdp as it should however between 2008 and 2017 the real gdp of china grew by around 7 6 trillion us dollars but private and government debt grew by an astonishing 25 trillion us dollars that is during those nine years the debt in china grew faster than gdp by a factor higher than three there are no parallels in modern history and it prompts an uncomfortable conclusion the chinese economy has become a ponzi it cannot sustain itself without a continued harrowing rise in debt halt the growth in debt and the real economy will tumble and that s what we have seen recently if it s broken you might want to fix it the fact is that something has gone seriously wrong in the model of global economic governance that has been in place since the second world war it may have never worked the way the macroeconomists envisaged it to work but clearly it is not working anymore in the march issue we will explain in detail based on data and academic research why the model of global governance has failed it should be heeded closely as the fragility of the global economy creates the possibility of a global crash as we have warned since march 2017 most likely it s too late to avert the global crash but one can always prepare we will return to that in more detail in june based on what has happened in the global economy one should be extra careful when calling for more stimulus it will most likely not benefit the real economy but it is likely to propel over valued asset markets even higher the unfortunate fact is that when asset markets go the fragile global economy will go with them the trap has been set annual subscription of our quarterly reports q reviews where we map out the risks and forecasts for the global economy the us and the the

lower 1 28978 today us dollar usd exchange rates pull back on on optimism over the us china trade talks overnight there was a distinctly positive note to markets at the open of trade this week as asian shares rallied in a continuation of the good momentum from the week before the headlines were filled with talk of china and the united states reaching some accord over trade leaving hopes high for some kind of resolution as the deadline approaches there is still plenty of time for talks to hit a snag however and with nothing agreed upon there is obviously a large amount of room for a disappointment the nikkei 225 and crude oil both jumped overnight and it means the dow could start on a bright note to try and secure its 9th straight week of gains advertisement preview the day ahead today promises to be rather quiet with next to no economic data due to be released in the united states the nation is observing president s day and this means volumes are likely to be fairly light with no eco stats on tap and most workers taking the day off there is still the potential for political events to generate some volatility with brexit clearly significant for the british pound and the weekend headlines filled with doomsday talk and theresa may desperately trying to rally mps to support her deal so far there is plenty to be concerned about as firms enact brexit contingency plans and the uk economic data has fallen off a cliff the jobs report tuesday will be very closely watched for evidence that this stalwart of the bank of england s hawkish outlook doesn t start slipping like the rest of the data we have seen lately in the uk tuesday s labour market release will be of more interest as an indication whether domestic inflationary pressures are continuing to build meanwhile thursday s january public finance data which contains receipts from income tax self assessment will provide an important indication whether the budget deficit is on course to hit the forecast target for 2018 19 according to marshall gittler chief strategist head of education acls global there is an interesting development that could legally force a new brexit referendum several irregularities have been found in the campaign such as the leave side spending more money than is legally allowed furthermore robert mueller the fellow who s investigating possible collusion between the trump campaign and russia has subpoenaed the cambridge analytica employee who worked on brexit which suggests there was russian meddling in the leave campaign too according to british law if an election campaign is found to have been corrupted by illegal activities it has to be re run will the brexit referendum be rerun now or pm may s deal put to a national vote if it is my guess is that it would be soundly defeated foreign exchange markets traders of the british pound to dollar exchange rate have been bailed out slightly by some evidence of weakness in the us economy which has dialed back rate expectations in the us after a miserable retail report the euro has also been a little firmer but growth expectations there are getting worse and worse suggesting even a flagging us economy could outperform a european economy facing something it hasn t seen in a decade namely a slowdown in the usually mighty german economy pound sterling outlook don t hold your breath for brexit progress as cable touches through 1 29 once more it is apparent that there is plenty to be concerned about for bulls hoping that this rally follows through analysts at scotiabank noted that the eu is likely now extremely aware that the uk can t affirm a deal and talking to theresa may is essentially a waste of time developments in parliament underscored pm may s weak position mainly because of the hard brexit contingent of her own party vote defeat means little from a procedural point of view it should be clear to the eu that there is little hope of attaining a conservative majority for any brexit deal brussels focus may pivot to trying to establish a cross party base for a customs union arrangement don t hold your breath technical analysis from the canadian institution is still suggesting that there is a considerable amount of resistance looming shortly overhead for the pound sterling gbp and as such are maintaining a bearish outlook in the near term the market has lost around half of the gains seen through dec and early jan and may consolidate around the 1 28 point in the short run trend signals have turned adverse on the short medium and longer run studies however and this suggests strong selling pressure is likely to emerge on minor gains while today might be quiet there is certainly likely to be plenty of significant headlines this week to get fx markets moving beginning with

metrics primarily ebitda adjusted ebitda net debt net debt to book capitalization and free cash flow we define ebitda as earnings before income taxes net interest expense gain or loss on extinguishment of long term debt net other income or expense and depreciation and amortization expense non cash losses on equity investments are also added back if applicable to arrive at our measure

bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm politics budget workers need to see rapid results cosatu they are tired of seeing hard earned taxes treated as petty cash by an unaccountable political and business elite cosatu s budget expectations statement 2019 18 february 2019 the congress of south african trade unions looks forward to the upcoming budget speech we expect the upcoming budget to set the tone and speak of ways to address the challenges facing the country and change the lives of the poor majority we have very high expectations for the 2019 budget speech given the extent of the economic and governance crises the nation faces the minister of finance tito mboweni needs to prove that he has a plan to fix our broken economy and also eliminating wasteful expenditure and corruption workers are losing jobs every day and the cost of living is going through the roof they need to see coherent action and rapid results workers are tired of seeing their hard earned taxes treated as petty cash by an unaccountable political and business elite we need to hear from the minister what is being done to stop the bleeding of resources that have been identified by the auditor general to date despite the ag estimating that we are losing 10 of national provincial and local budgets to looting we have not seen any solid plan to stop this we hope that the minister will rise to the moment and announce his support for parliament s progressive anti corruption pic amendment bill the national treasury and its ministry have been a stumbling block to this badly needed bill it is time treasury and the minister come to the party because the looting at pic is not acceptable we also acknowledge the president s efforts to attract foreign investment but we want the government to do much more to encourage and coerce the local investors to play their role they cannot keep asking for concessions while they are not delivering the investment strike from local businesses is not yet over and the economy continues to bleed jobs at an alarming rate we need to hear from the minister how the government will ensure that the jobs and investment summits commitments are implemented already there are deeply worrying betrayals abandonments with both government and business backtracking on their commitments to protect and create jobs the wave of retrenchments that are decimating workers in the private sector and now potentially the public sector are a huge betrayal of the working class our rising unemployment can t be resolved by retrenching more thousands of workers we need to hear how the government is going to move the economy from 1 growth to 3 the government needs to present a plan to rescue the mining agriculture tourism energy auto manufacturing sectors we also want to hear about a plan to grow the new and emerging sectors such as water conservation recycling ocean and aquaculture electric vehicles land rehabilitation and climate change these sectors hold great potential to create hundreds of thousands of jobs but need decisive leadership and a solid policy intervention from the government we need to hear about the government s interventions that place the creation of decent jobs at the centre of economic policy the budget speech should talk to ways of creating conducive conditions for the growth of the sme sector which targets local markets absorbs local labour and circulate its income into the local economy cosatu recognises the fiscal crises facing the state we believe that government if it simply manages budgets better reduces wasteful expenditure and corruption recovers stolen funds and prosecutes the looters the government needs to increase targeted expenditure to protect and uplift the poor and stimulate badly needed economic growth and at the same time begin to contain and reduce the unsustainable levels of public debt this is a matter of urgency and one that can be done if there is the political will too many departments and municipalities regularly fail to spend more than 10 of their budgets billions are wasted on glamour or vanity projects it is unacceptable that r12 5 billion has been allocated to build five departmental head offices and our consulate in new york it is time the government learns to spend worker s taxes in a smart way the government has not sought to reduce wasteful expenditure in a sustainable manner cancelling public servants performance bonuses without consulting them will only serve to demotivate these workers freezing posts in hospitals schools and home affairs only serve to weaken service delivery how does the state expect doctors and nurses to save lives when working 48 hours shifts or teachers to educate classes of 60 learners this is happening while there is still a bloated management structure and a cabinet of more than 70 ministers and deputy ministers 90 mecs and more than 9000 local government councillors cosatu hopes that this year will see a shift away from increasing the tax burden upon working and middle class families workers have been made to foot the bill for state capture for far too long the minister needs to announce that there will be no further anti worker tax hikes whilst recognizing the increased limit to how high taxes can be raised cosatu believes that the rich do not pay their fair share there is space to raise corporate income tax personal income tax for those earning above r1 5 million per annum inheritance and estate taxes and most critically import duties to protect local industries and jobs we need the minister to explain what measures are being put in place to fix sars in particular to deal with the scourge of illicit tobacco and clothing imports the government needs to announce serious measures to help the poor cope with the flurry of tax hikes in particular the vat hike whilst cosatu welcomes exempting sanitary pads from vat this is nowhere near enough to help the poor cosatu urges the government to increase the amount of free water and electricity allocated to indigent households we want clear turnaround plans for soe s that will not involve rendering thousands of workers unemployed at sabc saa sa express denel prasa transnet cosatu expects the minister to provide an update on rolling out of the improved public transport system and plan on how to enhance safety on public roads there is an urgent need to find an alternative model for funding expansion and improvement of road infrastructure cosatu remains opposed to e tolling and hopes that the minister will have to respond to the outcry against e tolls by scrapping this expensive system south africa is one of the most water scarce nations half the country is in a water crisis due to over consumption a growing population and infrastructure neglect and collapse we need to hear the government s plan to fix the dept of water and sanitation including dealing with those who allowed the giyani project to balloon from r40 million to r4 billion the driehoek school tragedy was a wakeup call for the nation our schools departments roads bridges police stations hospitals prisons military bases dams have been badly neglected by the custodian departments and the department of public works we need to hear about a funding model that will help avoid another bank of lisbon tragedy there is a lot riding on the 2019 budget cosatu will not support a budget that is detached from the manifesto to guide the government s programme the minister must not deliver a budget that is divorced from the anc elections manifesto issued by sizwe pamla national spokesperson cosatu 18 february 2019
more recently however weakness has been seen in the developed world too the major exception is the us which thanks to donald trump s tax cuts has been able to shrug off the malaise that appears to be affecting just about everyone else us exceptionalism however may not last economists traditionally have regarded the us as the locomotive that drives the global economy recent us strength however has not really fed through elsewhere and as the us is in a trade war with china from which neither is likely to emerge as a winner it may simply be that the us economy itself is living on borrowed time
