making it unlikely to attract or absorb significant foreign direct investment in 2009 gdp has declined by roughly 50 percent in the past eight years the largest peacetime drop ever recorded the economist intelligence unit estimates that it contracted 12 8 percent in 2008 year on year inflation was officially estimated to be 231 million percent in july 2008 the highest in the world unofficial inflation assessments conducted by independent economists estimate annual inflation to be in the hundreds of billions if not quadrillions but the local currency inflation figures are less relevant as dollarization of the economy becomes widespread government policies have seriously eroded the rule of law and put private property rights at grave risk in the absence of comprehensive reforms prospects for foreign direct investment along with the country s economic outlook are bound to remain dismal 2 the world bank group s doing business 2009 report ranked zimbabwe 158 out of 181 countries considered for ease of doing business and one of the worst performers in southern africa further illustrative of the abysmal investment climate zimbabwe was ranked 133 out of 134 countries considered in the world economic forum s global competitiveness index for 2008 2009 in addition zimbabwe was second from the bottom out of 68 regions and countries surveyed in the vancouver based fraser institutes 2007 2008 annual survey of mining companies on the attractiveness of government mining policies openness to foreign investment 3 the government s command and control tendencies and its intervention in many sectors make zimbabwe generally unwelcoming to foreign direct investment particularly from western countries furthermore the erosion of the rule of law and sanctity of contracts has had a chilling effect on business and on foreign direct investment nonetheless a few u s multinationals maintain subsidiaries in the country largely holdovers from better years a decade and more ago many others sell their products through certified dealers 4 the government s priority sectors for foreign investment are manufacturing mining and infrastructure development for tourism in these sectors foreign investors have been permitted to own up to 100 percent of the business enterprise although in 2008 the government introduced an indigenization act that mandates over time 51 percent indigenous ownership of businesses it also introduced an amendment to the mines and minerals act that has onerous indigenization requirements see below 5 the government reserves several sectors for local investors under current laws foreign investors wishing to participate in these sectors may only do so by entering into joint venture arrangements with local partners the foreign investors are restricted from owning more than 35 percent of the operation the following industries face these restrictions agriculture forestry primary production of food and cash crops harare 00000042 002 of 011 primary horticulture game wildlife ranching and livestock forestry fishing and fish farming poultry farming grain milling sugar refining transportation road haulage passenger bus taxis and car hire services of any kind tourist transportation rail operations retail wholesale trade including distribution barber shops hairdressing and beauty salons commercial photography employment agencies estate agencies valet services manufacturing marketing and distribution of armaments water provision for domestic and industrial purposes bakery and confectionary tobacco packaging and grading post auction cigarette manufacturing 6 foreign investors wishing to start a new project in zimbabwe must first register with and be approved by the zimbabwe investment authority which then issues investment certificates this is the first port of call for any investor wishing to invest in zimbabwe 7 all private firms are required to incorporate and register with the registrar of companies within the framework of their investment certificate or exchange control approval foreign investment in existing companies requires reserve bank of zimbabwe approval applications are submitted to the bank s exchange control department through the investor s commercial bank or merchant bank or other authorized dealer foreign investors with valid investment certificates may acquire real estate 8 in the mid 1990s the government identified privatization of zimbabwe s parastatal companies as a priority but only two state owned enterprises have been successfully privatized since then the parastatals operational inefficiencies weak balance sheet positions a huge debt overhang and the current political impasse make it unlikely that privatization will go forward in the near term 9 commensurate with its anti west stance in recent years the government began to encourage economic ties with asian countries particularly china as a means of arresting further economic decline and combating what it casts as neo colonialism under this look east policy selected asian investors have been offered access to reserved sectors sometimes at the expense of local or established foreign investors despite the official emphasis placed on these ties and a few high profile project announcements asian investment is dwarfed by te remaining investment from south africa and theu k converson and transfer policies harare 00000042 003 of 011 10 for the past several years zimbabwe has experienced an acute foreign currency deficit that has caused crippling shortages of fuel electric power and other imported goods and components defaults on public and private sector debt service payments and a sharp decline in industrial agricultural and mining operations foreign currency is highly difficult to obtain through licit channels due to the reserve bank of zimbabwe s exchange controls the country s poor export performance and the lack of balance of payments support the foreign exchange control act regulates currency conversions and transfers it does not prohibit foreign investors from moving assets between zimbabwean and foreign accounts but lack of foreign exchange and constraints of the foreign exchange regime impede the remittance of investment returns some local businesses have credibly charged that the government has raided their foreign currency accounts to meet certain foreign obligations falling due 11 exporters may retain 85 percent of their foreign currency account balance for their own use within 30 days while 15 percent must be sold to the reserve bank at the highly disadvantageous inter bank exchange rate rather than the market determined parallel rate uncertainties associated with retention requirements and retention period which have been adjusted frequently and without notice constrain business planning and operations the retention requirement and unfavorable exchange rate act as an effective tax on exports 12 the foreign exchange control act extends to prospective outward investment as well as dividend remittances traditionally the government has discouraged investment by zimbabweans outside the country and relatively few zimbabwean firms made such investments expropriation and compensation 13 despite provisions in zimbabwe s constitution that prohibit the acquisition of private property without compensation the government has sanctioned seizures of privately owned agricultural land without compensation since 2001 many of the farms seized were subsequently transferred to government officials and other regime supporters the government in april 2000 amended the constitution to authorize the compulsory acquisition of privately owned commercial farms with compensation limited to the improvements made on the land in september 2005 the government amended the constitution again to transfer ownership of all expropriated land to the government since the passage of this amendment top government officials ruling party supporters and members of the security forces have continued to disrupt production on commercial farms including those owned by foreign investors and covered by bilateral investment promotion and protection agreements bippa 14 in november 2006 the government issued the first batch of 99 year leases to 125 farmers these leases however are not readily transferable as the government retains the right to strip the lease at any time 15 the government s program to seize commercial farms without either the intention or the funds to compensate the titleholders who have no recourse to the courts has raised serious questions about respect for property rights and the rule of law in zimbabwe harare 00000042 004 of 011 accordingly zimbabwe was ranked 113 out of 181 countries considered with respect to the country s ability to protect investment under the world bank group s doing business 2009 report 16 president mugabe and other politicians have in the past threatened to target the mining and manufacturing sectors for similarly forced indigenization in 2008 the government amended the mines and minerals act outlining indigenization requirements for minerals for strategic energy minerals coal methane uranium the legislation would require mining companies engaged in their extraction or exploitation to transfer ownership to the state of 51 percent of the shares 25 percent would be non contributory i e without compensation for precious metals precious stones 25 percent of the shares must be transferred to the state without compensation and the other 26 percent are required to be owned by the state or by indigenous zimbabweans 17 in march 2008 the government enacted the indigenization and economic empowerment bill that mandates over time 51 percent indigenous ownership of business dispute settlement 18 the government has acceded to the 1965 convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states and to the 1958 new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 19 in the event of an investment dispute the government of zimbabwe agrees in theory to submit the matter for settlement by arbitration according to the rules and procedures promulgated by the united nations commission on international trade law uncitral once the investor has exhausted the administrative and judicial remedies available locally on the other hand constitutional amendment 17 enacted in 2005 removed the right of landowners whose land has been acquired by the government to challenge the acquisition in court 20 a group of dutch farmers whose farms were seized under the land reform program took their case to the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes icsid in april 2005 demanding that the zimbabwe government honor the bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement bippa between the netherlands and zimbabwe the case was heard by a tribunal in paris in november 2007 and the tribunal issued a verdict in 2007 that was favorable to the farmers the zimbabwe government acknowledged that the farmers had been deprived of their land without payment of compensation but disputed the over us 30 million in damages claimed by the farmers a decision on the amount of damages has not yet been reached 21 in a related case a three judge panel of the southern african development community sadc tribunal in windhoek namibia ruled that zimbabwe s violent land reform exercise discriminated against a group of white farmers who filed an application challenging the seizure of their farms the tribunal ruled that the government was in breach of the sadc treaty with regards to discrimination although the government s first reaction was to refuse to recognize the ruling it has since softened its position it subsequently recommended that 341 white farmers be allowed to continue farming harare 00000042 005 of 011 throughout the country 22 government efforts to influence and intimidate the judiciary since the late 1990s have raised serious concerns about investors receiving a fair hearing in local courts in addition the government and ruling elite have ignored numerous adverse judgments and senior officials have reiterated publicly that court orders that are not politically acceptable to the ruling party will not be honored administrations of justice in those commercial cases that lack political overtones are still generally impartial as the government s budget constraint deepens however court resources have dwindled and dockets have become backlogged a less costly dispute settlement route which can be incorporated in contracts between companies is alternative dispute resolution performance requirements and incentives 23 several tax breaks are available for new investment by foreign and domestic companies capital expenditures on new factories machinery and improvements are fully deductible and the government waives import tax and surtax on capital equipment other incentives for investors include investment allowance of 15 percent in the year of purchase of industrial and commercial buildings staff housing and articles implements and machinery 25 percent special initial allowance on cost of industrial buildings and commercial buildings and machinery in growth point areas is granted as a rebate for the first four years special mining lease provisions entitling the holder to specific incentive packages to be negotiated with the ministry of mines refund of value added tax 15 percent for capital goods purchased in zimbabwe and intended for use in priority projects or investment in growth points 24 there are no general performance requirements outside of export processing zones government policy however encourages investment in enterprises that contribute to rural development job creation exports use of local materials and transfer of appropriate technologies 25 there are no discriminatory import or export policies affecting foreign firms although the government s approval criteria are heavily skewed toward export oriented projects import duties and related taxes range as high as 110 percent export processing zone designated companies must export at least 80 percent of output 26 government participation is required in new investments in strategic industries such as energy public water provision railways and armaments the terms of government participation are determined on a case by case basis during license approval the few foreign investors for example from china and iran in reserved strategic industries have either purchased existing companies or have supplied equipment and spares on credit 27 foreign investors are expected to make maximum use of zimbabwean management and technical personnel and any investment proposal that involves the employment of expatriates must present a strong case for doing so in order to obtain work and residence permits normally the maximum contract period for an expatriate is harare 00000042 006 of 011 three years but this will be extended to five years for individuals with highly specialized skills expatriates who have prior permission from the reserve bank s exchange control department are permitted to remit one third of their salaries right to private ownership and establishment 28 although zimbabwean law guarantees the right to private ownership this right is increasingly not respected in practice as noted above the government has in recent years seized thousands of private farms and conservancies including ones belonging to americans and other foreign investors without due process or compensation most of these property owners held zimbabwe investment authority investment certificates and purchased their land after independence in 1980 despite repeated u s protests the government has not addressed the expropriation of u s citizen property protection of property rights 29 the government s demonstrated desire to expand its control of the economy puts many investments particularly in real property at risk the government s 2005 operation restore order resulted in more than 700 000 persons losing their homes their means of livelihood or both according to un estimates many of these properties had proper titles and licenses although operation restore order officially ended in 2005 the government continued to evict smaller numbers of people from their homes and businesses primarily in and around harare in 2006 and 2007 in addition to the thousands of agricultural properties seized under land reform during the past eight years in late 2005 the government for the first time authorized the seizure of non agricultural land for the purpose of constructing residential stands in a harare suburb 30 since independence zimbabwe has applied international patent and trademark conventions it is a member of the world intellectual property organization generally the government seeks to honor intellectual property ownership and rights although there are serious doubts about its ability to enforce these obligations due to a lack of expertise and manpower we are not aware of any grievances over such issues but pirating of videos and computer software is common most videos and computer software sold on the local market for example are pirated goods 31 the judiciary generally upholds the sanctity of contracts between private companies however in the case of contracts involving the government or politically influential individuals judgments sometimes appear biased in favor of the latter transparency of the regulatory system 32 the government s officially stated policy is to encourage competition within the private sector that said bureaucratic functions in this increasingly controlled economy lack transparency and corruption within the regulatory system is increasingly worrisome harare 00000042 007 of 011 33 companies for example are not allowed to increase the price of monitored goods without government approval in june 2007 minister of industry and international trade obert mpofu went a step further and introduced operation reduce prices a campaign to lower prices on all goods and services by half or more while the measure temporarily slowed the rate of inflation it wreaked havoc with the supply chain and accelerated the pace of economic contraction in zimbabwe over the following months police arrested and fined more than 5 000 business executives and store managers for violating the price reduction decree moreover the responsible ministry implemented the decree in a selective fashion and also failed to process price increase requests in a timely and transparent way 34 in august 2006 the reserve bank redenominated the inflation ridden currency slashing three zeros from its value as part of the redenomination regulations the public and business were allowed to convert only set amounts at financial institutions police extended this prohibition to the general cash carrying public although there was no regulatory or legal basis for limiting the amount of cash one carried on august 1 2008 the reserve bank again redenominated the currency lopping off 10 zeros coins that had been taken out of circulation in 2003 were reintroduced at face value which only served to further complicate the monetary environment efficient capital markets and portfolio investment 35 zimbabwe s stock market has 83 publicly listed companies overall trading is thin and volatile and the public stock of many smaller companies is closely held in september 1996 the government opened the stock and money markets to limited foreign portfolio investment since then a maximum of 40 percent of any locally listed company can be foreign owned with any single investor allowed to acquire up to 10 percent of the outstanding shares investment on the zimbabwe stock exchange zse surged in real terms in 2007 and most of 2008 as domestic investors sought a hedge against hyperinflation risk seeking foreign investors were drawn to zimbabwe by a combination of undervalued assets and the expectation of political change in the short to medium term furthermore foreign investors recognized that most companies registered on the zse were already compliant with the onerous indigenization requirements under discussion the introduction of stringent trading conditions on november 17 2008 which required all trades to be backed by a leter of confirmation from bank chief executive offcers confirming the availability of funds burstthe speculative bubble since november 20 there has been no trading activity on the exchange 36 in 2005 the government introduced a five percent withholding tax on the sale of marketable securities it also required short term insurance companies long term insurance companies and pension funds to invest 25 percent 30 percent and 35 percent respectively of their portfolios in prescribed government bonds these requirements essentially tax portfolios at the required investment rates since the real interest rate with hyperinflation is lower than 99 99 percent the reserve bank for example introduced a one year insurance and pension industry bond on november 14 2008 for sale to pension funds as a mechanism to raise cheap capital it pays 450 percent interest harare 00000042 008 of 011 37 zimbabwe s mounting economic problems have driven foreign direct investment fdi inflows from us 103 million in 2005 to us 40 million in 2006 before rising slightly to us 69 million in 2007 according to the world investment report compiled by the united nations conference on trade and development unctad 38 once relatively robust by regional standards zimbabwe s financial sector has contracted greatly in recent years as business and demand for sophisticated transactions evaporates two major international commercial banks and a number of regional and domestic banks operate with over 200 branches total following the well publicized failure of a number of financial institutions in 2003 primarily due to fraud and inept management reserve bank regulations have been tightened greatly nonetheless financial institutions have an uncertain future due to ever dwindling demand for credit from business clients and inconsistent policies on interest rates statutory reserves and exchange rates moreover as the economy dollarizes demand for local currency denominated accounts is falling further impairing local banks political violence 39 the opposition and civil society groups operate in an environment of intimidation and repression human rights organizations reported that physical and psychological torture perpetrated by security agents and government supporters increased in the period between the march 2008 elections and the june 2008 presidential run off individuals and companies out of favor with the government or regarded by the government as aligned with the opposition routinely suffer harassment and bureaucratic obstacles in their business dealings indicatively the government has closed three independent newspapers and has denied numerous telecommunications licenses for apparently political reasons on occasion domestic businesspeople out of favor with the government have been incarcerated for allegedly engaging in illegal business practices such as externalization of currency 40 despite rising dissatisfaction with government policy there have been no large scale demonstrations although sporadic cases of looting by soldiers and small scale demonstrations have occurred corruption 41 there is widespread corruption in government implementation of the government s ongoing redistribution of expropriated commercial farms has substantially favored the ruling party elite and continues to lack transparency top ruling party officials and business people supporting the ruling party have received priority in distribution of the country s resources including priority access to limited foreign exchange agricultural inputs machinery and fuel 42 in 2005 the government enacted an anti corruption act that established a government appointed anti corruption commission to investigate corruption however it includes no members from civil society or the private sector the ministry of state enterprises anti monopolies and anti corruption was also established to oversee harare 00000042 009 of 011 and coordinate the government s efforts to combat corruption however government officials and police lack sufficient political backing at senior levels of the government to effectively investigate cases the government prosecutes individuals selectively focusing on those who have fallen out of favor with the ruling party and ignoring transgressions by members of the favored elite bilateral investment agreements 43 the u s has no bilateral investment or trade treaty with zimbabwe zimbabwe has bilateral investment protection and promotion agreements bippa with 17 countries only four of these treaties with the netherlands denmark germany and switzerland have been ratified opic and other investment insurance programs 44 the u s government and zimbabwe concluded an opic agreement in april 1999 zimbabwe acceded to the world bank s multilateral investment guarantee agency miga in september 1989 support by the export import bank of the u s is not available to zimbabwe many other major donor countries have also suspended their trade finance and export promotion programs as well as investment insurance due largely to zimbabwe s mounting multilateral and bilateral arrears and deteriorating investment climate labor 45 zimbabwe s interconnected economic and political crises have prompted many of the country s most skilled and well educated citizens to emigrate leading to widespread labor shortages for managerial and technical jobs at the same time the severe contraction of the economy in recent years has caused formal sector employment to drop significantly the best available surveys place formal sector unemployment as high as 80 percent independent analysts estimate that only about 700 000 people or roughly 7 percent of zimbabwe s population are employed in the formal sector as noted above foreign investors are encouraged to hire local nationals 46 the country s hiv aids epidemic is also taking a heavy toll on the workforce however with substantial support from the u s government and other donors zimbabwe has instituted policies that have contributed to reducing the adult infection rate from 22 1 percent in 2003 to 15 6 percent in 2007 47 the government is a signatory to international labor organization ilo conventions protecting worker rights although the world body has designated zimbabwe as a notorious country for its continued attempts to limit workers right to organize and hold labor union meetings the 1985 labor relations act set strict standards for occupational health and safety but enforcement is fairly lax and inconsistent across the industrial sectors 48 in light of the hyperinflationary environment employers and harare 00000042 010 of 011 workers have agreed to negotiate wages and other benefits on a quarterly and monthly rather than annual basis collective bargaining takes place through a national employment council nec in each industry comprising representatives from labor business and government in addition the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu the country s umbrella labor organization advocates for workers rights 49 a tripartite negotiating forum tnf was established in 2001 for labor business and government to tackle macro social issues however these talks have been fitful and unproductive since their inception a continuing impasse for the tfn is disagreement between business and labor over indexing wages to the poverty datum line pdl which calculates the minimum required for a family of five to pay basic expenses independent economists estimate that roughly 80 percent of zimbabwe s population lives below the pdl 50 the government continued its harassment of the zctu and its leadership in may 2008 and prior to the presidential run off in june police arrested zctu leaders for spreading falsehoods prejudicial to the state under zimbabwe labor law the government can intervene in zctu s internal affairs if it determines that the leadership is not acting in the workers interest the government has threatened to eliminate the zctu and has taken steps to marginalize the traditional unions and the formal labor dispute resolution mechanism to undercut the strength of zctu the government created an alternative umbrella organization the zimbabwe federation of trade unions zftu however outside of government the zftu is not regarded as a legitimate labor organization the zctu remains the voice of labor in zimbabwe and the country s official and internationally recognized labor organization foreign trade zones free ports 51 the government promulgated legislation creating export processing zones epzs in 1996 zimbabwe now has 183 epz designated companies benefits include a five year tax holiday duty free importation of raw materials and capital equipment for use in the epz and no tax liability from capital gains arising from the sale of property forming part of the investment in epzs since january 2004 the government has generally required that foreign capital comprise a majority of the investment the requirement on epz designated companies to export at least 80 percent of output has constrained foreign investment in the zones the merger between the zimbabwe investment centre and the zimbabwe export processing zones authority which began in 2006 has been completed and the new institution the zimbabwe investment authority now

two key events at the beginning of 2018 defined the economic policies of pakistan for the rest of the year the change of finance minister ishaq dar and the united states president donald trump s tweet in which he accused islamabad of deceit and lies both these events symbolise instability that continued till the day although prime minister imran khan on december 28 declared that the phase of uncertainty is over the country had three finance ministers in past one year due to an election year and resignation of former fm ishaq dar because of frequent change of command at the top the economic policies changed too every time which according to some economic experts caused unnecessary pain to the masses trump s late night tweet just when the 2018 dawned was a clear indication of what kind of difficulties pakistan s rulers would have to face in bringing in dollars to avoid default on international debt obligations and to deal with the serious challenge at the hands of the financial action task force fatf undoubtedly both the international monetary fund imf and the fatf are under immense influence of the us many had predicted that pakistan would be at the doorstep of the imf in 2018 and trump s tweet raised apprehensions that this time it would have to deal with a tough imf the fears were true the kind of difficulties pakistan faced being on the wrong side of the us can be best described in the words of the pm khan he acknowledged that the imf was unusually tough on pakistan due to political reasons but hoped that the problem would be over due to improvement in relations with the us due to tough imf and irritated us it was for the first time that an imf mission that had arrived for bailout negotiations left islamabad on november 20 without reaching a staff level agreement in 2018 after 16 years pakistan excluded the coalition support fund csf receipts from the us from its new fiscal year budget estimates on an average 1billion annual disbursements had helped keep overall budget deficit under some control at the start of 2018 the former pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n government had taken some decisive measures like launching crackdown against hafiz saeed s jamaat ud dawa this did not work out in feb the fatf placed pakistan back on its terror financing watch list with effect from june 2018 after ishaq dar s exit from the scene the then prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi had decided to pick businessman turned politician dr miftah ismail to run the economy his first step was to defreeze the value of currency that dar had kept unchanged and through 7 billion to defend the value under dr ismail s watch the rupee shed its value by rs10 or 9 52 trading around rs115 the pml n government also gave its last tax amnesty scheme with an aim of broadening the tax net and offering wealthy pakistanis a chance to declare their hidden assets in pakistan and abroad the offshore tax amnesty scheme was part of a five point radical economic reforms package with an aim to increase existing narrow tax base of only 1 2 million individuals to 30 million in april 2018 pakistan put off the signing of a revised free trade agreement with china at the last moment due to strong reservations about the final offer list shared by beijing in may the pml n announced its sixth and last budget and also declared that the economic growth rate peaked to 5 8 in the fiscal year 2017 18 which was the highest in 13 years soon after end of the pml n government the claims of good economic progress started busting the ministry of finance that hardly a week earlier was claiming marvelous economic achievements went straight to the caretaker prime minister and told him that without the support of the imf the country s financial survival is at stake an imf team was quietly invited but the caretaker government backed out from the programme talks despite admitting that pakistan may face difficulties in meeting its international debt obligations due to mounting external sector challenges yet the caretaker finance minister dr shamshad akhtar devalued the currency by another rs10 hitting the rs125 to a dollar mark in july 2018 a level that moody s credit rating agency had predicted for a year later the country s trade deficit and current account deficit figures were out by that time pakistan booked its highest trade deficit in history of 37 7 billion with imports standing at a record 60 9 billion resultantly the current account deficit also widened to a record 18 9 billion pakistan s borrowing from foreign sources also hit a record high at 11 4 billion in fiscal year 2017 18 the government s debt was equivalent to 72 5 of the gdp at the end of fiscal year 2018 the ratio was higher than the median estimate for b rated sovereigns of 55 of gdp for 2017 the public debt management risk report of june 2018 released by the ministry of finance showed that most of the indicators moved further towards dangerous levels while three breached the redline set in the medium term debt strategy by the time the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti took over the reins in august it was evident that the new government will have to walk a tightrope as its plan to increase development and social spending as well as to reduce taxes would clash with the need to further tighten monetary and fiscal policies to reduce economic vulnerabilities on july 26 asad umar the current finance minister met with media before taking oath of the office and said the crisis is so severe and requires measures so urgent that no option can be ruled out he and prime minister imran khan travelled the next few months with a begging bowl in hand and finally secured breathing space from the united arab emirates and saudi arabia china has not yet publicly announced the quantum of its assistance to pakistan the pti government also unveiled its rs5 3 trillion revised budget for this fiscal year but its emergency measures lacked the ideological shift that was needed to document the growing informal economy and spur economic growth to create jobs resultantly the dawn of 2019 may see another mini budget umar took a bold step and returned the cabinet s powers to issue supplementary budget the government linked authorisation of supplementary budgets with prior approval of the federal cabinet tightening the slack fiscal controls that were exploited in the past by both bureaucrats and politicians for whimsical spending of the taxpayers money the pti government also drastically revised down the active privatisation list restricting it to only 8 from 64 companies all bleeding companies like pakistan international airlines pia and the pakistan steel mills psm have been dropped from active list of privatization in between there was a good news and pakistan finally jumped up 11 places on the word bank s ease of doing business index and clinched 136th position for the first time in 15 years due to reforms introduced by previous federal and provincial governments during the year the rulers devalued the currency by 33 and increased interest rates by over 425 basis points which were probably the most stringent measures taken by any country in the region these measures along with anticipated additional taxes will stifle the economic growth rate this will make difficult for prime minister khan to meet his two topmost priorities providing 10 million jobs and shelter through 50 million housing units despite these measures the investors remained nervous and the pakistan stock exchange psx has been nose diving after the recent devaluation the rupee is trading at an all time low of rs139 to the greenback in the inter bank market yet more will come but hopes for the export to revive remain diminishing due to lack of exportable surplus the pt government is projected to add over rs10 trillion in public debt during its first three years due to rigidity in expenditures increase in interest rates and currency devaluation this debt will be equal to the total debt added by the last pml n government in its five years term the government will face serious issues in broadening the tax base for the tax year 2018 there are about 1 5 million taxpayers on the active taxpayers list the tax revenues will be another challenge for the pti in 2019 as it has so far remained unable to appoint a dynamic person to head the federal board of revenue fbr jehanzeb khan could be a good federal secretary finance how 2019 will be in terms of economic growth rate can be best described in the words of finance minister asad umar when there is an issue of survival economic growth becomes a secondary issue he said on december 28
after a roller coaster 2018 a year of unprecedented events that impacted markets in unexpected ways everyone is now wondering what is in store for global economies particularly the emerging ones much was seen in the year behind but the confrontation on trade between the u s and china has left the biggest mark it is an issue that almost everyone agrees poses the biggest risk and could derail growth in 2019 added to that many other worrisome topics and uncertainties also remain on the table such as what will happen with the brexit process then monetary tightening policies and interest rate hikes by key central banks in the world prospects of slowing global growth as well as the extreme volatility in financial markets in 2018 the trade war was the dog that barked in 2019 it will bite is how bloomberg cited the trade war between the world s two largest economies so far the trade war resulted in billions of dollars of losses for both sides in 2018 hitting industries including automotive technology and agriculture the world s leading financial institutions including the international monetary fund imf and the world bank had warned that the trade tensions threatened to rip apart the global economy the imf warned in december it could further cut its global growth forecasts in january citing the potential fallout from the trade war the imf cut its global growth forecast in october to 3 7 percent for both 2018 and 2019 down from 3 9 percent projected in july the european central bank ecb also said that the global economy is set to slow down in 2019 i see the u s china tension turning into a real trade war as the greatest risk for the global economy in 2019 such a situation would lead to the opening of a door leading to a long period of distress for the global economy and it is not known what will come out of that door qnb finansinvest chief economist burak kanlı told daily sabah particularly for the u s and china kanlı said trade wars bring along foreign exchange rate wars then capital controls a slowdown in the global economy as well as inflation all of which are annoying to even think of in a major development following their escalating fight throughout the year u s president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping called a 90 day truce until march 1 in the ongoing trade war during their buenos aires steak dinner on the sidelines of the g20 summit in argentina on dec 1 tariffs could hit china s gdp by 1 5 percent in 2019 the truce leaves american tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods in place but removes for now trump s threat to increase the tariffs on 200 billion of those goods in january to 25 percent from 10 percent and to impose tariffs on all imports from china even if the g20 truce holds according to bloomberg the dispute could represent the early stages of a prolonged economic cold war bloomberg economics suggested that if trump follows through on threats to slap duties on all imports from china it could hit china s 2019 gross domestic product growth by 1 5 percentage points taking the growth down toward 5 percent kanlı also said he expects the tension that led us to sit and hop up in the last few months to dissolve or at least to slack in the first quarter of 2019 trump offered investors a ray of hope that 2019 may offer less volatility when it comes to china after his tweet on saturday that big progress is being made toward a possible trade deal between the two countries just had a long and very good call with president xi of china trump wrote on his twitter account deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made on the other hand reuters cited chinese state media which quoted xi as saying that teams from both countries have been working to implement a consensus reached with trump i hope that the two teams will meet each other half way work hard and strive to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial and beneficial to the world as soon as possible xi said according to the state run xinhua news agency experts previously suggested that both sides agreed that things were getting a little too hot and that they decided to give each other some months of breathing room but that it would be difficult for the two to fundamentally resolve the differences that they have had whether the said 90 days will be enough for the two countries to sort all of their problems out remains to be seen slowing global growth tight monetary policies meanwhile prospects of slowing global growth also persist after what turned out to be its best performance since 2005 the u s economy is expected to slow down next year the extreme volatility in financial markets and softening business activity has raised concerns the u s economy might enter a recession in 2019 the same goes for the global economy as well i do not agree with the views that emerged over the last month that the u s economy will be entering a recession in 2019 so i think the market is a bit too pessimistic i̇ş yatırım international markets director şant manukyan told daily sabah although the warning signs are on a slowdown that could turn into such stagnation is out of the question however a slowdown is possible in the rate that will affect developing countries manukyan said kanlı on the other hand said i think it is too early to sink into recent pessimistic views that global growth is likely to fall sharply although some slowdown in growth seems inevitable i believe it may be limited by the alleviation of the problem between china and the u s he noted that at the moment the political risk premium in the u s is perhaps for the first time in history higher than that of many emerging economies at the moment uncertainty about trade wars creates a huge price and demand uncertainty for the producer in the u s and expectations are worsening at the pace we have not seen recently in such an environment the government is shutting down in the united states and even the dismissal of the fed chairman was absurdly being discussed what else to expect kanlı noted adding that these overlapping shocks caused investors in the u s who are unused to these kinds of shocks to panic and sink into pessimism meanwhile even though the wall street posted gains on friday building on a late rally on thursday the benchmark s p 500 index ended 2018 with most probably its worst december slump since the great depression earlier in the volatile last week the s p 500 touched a 20 month low then on wednesday the s p 500 the dow jones industrial average and nasdaq posted their biggest daily jumps in nearly a decade we are entering 2019 in an environment where the risk premium is very high i think this panic will decrease in the next few months especially by noting that i expect the tension between china and the u s to decrease as for the developing countries especially for those having external balance issues such as turkey it points to a year in which the u s economy will grow but not very fast and actually an appropriate environment in terms of capital flows and financial stability especially the decline in commodity prices creates a great relief kanlı added furthermore global monetary policies will be another important issue that will be looked after in 2019 with markets paying special attention to the key central banks such as the fed the ecb and the bank of england boe the fed on dec 19 hiked its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent despite warnings from trump against the move and it also lowered its projections for hikes in the next year citing financial market volatility and slowing global growth the decision was the fourth increase in 2018 and ninth since fed began normalizing rates in december 2015 it projects two rate increases in 2019 despite concerns of an economic slowdown in the eu over the next couple of years the ecb at its december meeting formally halted its 2 6 trillion euro 2 96 trillion crisis fighting bond buying program it used to stimulate growth and has pushed billions of euros into higher yielding markets on the other hand during its last monetary policy meeting in december the boe decided to keep its interest rates on hold at 0 75 percent warning about the brexit uncertainty although the monetary tightening of major central banks creates financial volatility and periodic confusion in an environment where emerging economies continue to grow i do not expect it to have a negative impact on these countries kanlı explained however he said capital inflows will certainly be more selective in an environment where the amount of money is no longer increasing and the cost is on the rise in this sense kanlı added countries with lower indebtedness and whose source of growth is the productivity increase will go through this period without any problems while countries that have not done their homework tenaciously in the recent years will have difficulties in attracting capital on the other hand the i̇ş yatırım international markets director said as for the euro zone the economic slowdown has already shown itself in the pmi purchasing managers index data in recent months this slowdown may be further accelerated by the ecb s halt of asset purchases manukyan said indicating that different scenarios await the developing countries he noted that a serious slowdown a great victory of extremists in the european parliament elections in march or a crisis created by italy will also bring about a negative environment on the other hand while reducing the balance sheet of fed the borrowing of nearly 1 trillion by the u s treasury and putting the pressure on the dollar liquidity and its cost will force developing countries manukyan added until march he continued there are important developments concerning the global markets the start into a new year by the u s house of representatives which has passed under the control of democrats the debt ceiling issue the european parliament elections the brexit and the trump investigation for this reason i think we will see a little more sales of u s indexes behind a short term optimism but as i said before i think it is early for a 2008 bear alike market the actual problems especially those originating from europe will emerge in 2020 and in a very violent manner in short although 2019 will not be a bad year in terms of pricing it will be a very critical year to prepare and streamline our home he said brexit biggest risk in short term brexit d day is getting closer as britain s departure from the european union is due to happen in just three months however there is little consensus on how that will be eventually achieved experts and business people see it as the biggest risk in the short term brits voted in a referendum on june 23 2016 on whether the u k should leave or stay in the eu the referendum saw 52 percent of voters opt for the exit deal and almost two and a half years later the u k prime minister theresa may agreed on the eu withdrawal agreement with the eu however there is still work to be done as parliament also needs to accept the negotiated brexit deal the postponed vote in parliament on britain s brexit agreement will be held the week of jan 14 more than a month after it was originally scheduled this vote is potentially the biggest threat to may s plans the u k based institute of directors iod a group representing business directors and leaders said recently business leaders confidence in the british economy has sunk to its lowest level in more than 18 months as the risk of a no deal brext in a little over three months grows according to bloomberg economics a no deal brexit could mean the british gdp is about 7 percent lower by 2030 compared to remaining in the eu the report also suggested that a brexit that involves the u k staying part of a customs union with the eu would still have a hit on the economy adding that output would likely be 3 percent lower by 2030 in that scenario furthermore bank of england gov mark carney warned recently the economy could shrink by 8 percent in the space of a year in the event of a disorderly no deal brexit a sharper contraction than during the 2008 financial crisis the impact the brexit could have on the other countries is also one the issues being discussed speaking of the matter kanlı told said that he expects the process to be solved sooner or later emphasizing that he does not expect it to have a greater impact on non european countries

the rich are only defeated when running for their lives c l r james the black jacobins in less than two months the yellow vests gilets jaunes movement in france has reshaped the political landscape in europe for a seventh straight week demonstrations continued across the country even after concessions from a cowing president emmanuel macron while inspiring a wave of similar gatherings in neighboring states like belgium and the netherlands just as el sisi s dictatorship banned the sale of high visibility vests to prevent copycat rallies in egypt corporate media has predictably worked overtime trying to demonize the spontaneous and mostly leaderless working class movement in the hopes it will not spread elsewhere the media oligopoly initially attempted to ignore the insurrection altogether but when forced to reckon with the yellow vests they maligned the incendiary marchers using horseshoe theory to suggest a confluence between far left and far right supporters of jean luc mélenchon and marine le pen to the surprise of no one mainstream pundits have also stoked fears of russian interference behind the unrest we can assume that if the safety vests were ready made off the assembly line of ngos like the raised fist flags of serbia s otpor movement the presstitutes would be telling a different story it turned out that a crisis was not averted but merely postponed when macron defeated his demagogue opponent le pen in the 2017 french election while it is true that the gilets jaunes were partly impelled by an increase on fuel prices contrary to the prevailing narrative their official demands are not limited to a carbon tax they also consist of explicit ultimatums to increase the minimum wage improve the standard of living and an end to austerity among other legitimate grievances since taking office macron has declared war on trade unions while pushing through enormous tax breaks for the wealthy like himself it was just a matter of time until the french people had enough of the country s privatization it is only a shock to the oblivious establishment why the former rothschild banker turned politician who addressed the nation seated at a gold desk while paris was ablaze is suddenly in jeopardy of losing power the status quo s incognizance is reminiscent of marie antoinette who during the 18th century when told the peasants had no bread famously replied let them eat cake as the masses starved under her husband louis xiv while the media s conspicuous blackout of coverage is partly to blame the deafening silence from across the atlantic in the united states is really because of the lack of class consciousness on its political left with the exception of occupy wall street the american left has been so preoccupied with an endless race to the bottom in the two party culture wars it is unable to comprehend an upheaval undivided by the contaminants of identity politics a political opposition that isn t fractured on social issues is simply unimaginable not to say the masses in france are exempt from the internal contradictions of the working class but the fetishization of lifestyle politics in the u s has truly become its weakness we will have to wait and see whether the yellow vests transform into a global movement or arrive in america but for now the seeming lack of solidarity stateside equates to a complicity with macron s agenda it serves as a reminder of the historically revisionist understanding of french politics in the u s that is long established the middle class dominated left wing in america ascribes to a historical reinterpretation of the french revolution that is a large contributor of its aversion to transformative praxis in favor of incrementalism the late italian marxist philosopher and historian domenico losurdo who died in june of this year offered the most thorough understanding of its misreading of history in seminal works such as war and revolution rethinking the twentieth century the liberal rereading of the french revolution is the ideological basis for its rejection of the revolutionary tradition from the jacobins to the bolsheviks that has neutralized the modern left to this day according to its revised history the inevitable outcome of comprehensive systemic change is robespierre s so called reign of terror or the purges of the stalin era in the soviet union in its view what began with the locke and montesquieu influenced reforms of the constitutional monarchy was hijacked by the radical jacobin and sans culotte factions losurdo explains that counter revolutionaries eager to discredit the image of rebellion overemphasize its violence and bloodshed and never properly contextualize it as self defense against the real reign of terror by the ruling class the idea behind this recasting of history is to conflate revolutionary politics with nazi germany whose racially motivated genocide was truly the inheritor of the legacy of european colonialism not the ancestry of the jacobins or the russian revolution maximilien robespierre s real crime in the eyes of bourgeois historians was attempting to fulfill the egalitarian ideals of republicanism by transferring political power from the aristocracy and nouveaux riche directly into the hands of the working class just as the paris commune did nearly 80 years later it is for this reason he subsequently became one of the most misunderstood and unfairly maligned figures in world history perhaps one day to be absolved the u s reaction to the yellow vests is a continuation of the denial and suppression of the class conflict inherent in the french revolution which continues to seethe beneath the surfaces of capitalism today in today s political climate it is easy to forget that there have been periods where the american left was actually engaged with the crisis of global capitalism in what seems like aeons ago the anti globalization movement in the wake of nafta culminated in huge protests in seattle in 1999 which saw nearly 50 000 march against the world trade organization following the 2008 financial collapse it briefly reemerged in the occupy movement which was also swiftly put down by corporate state repression currently the political space once inhabited by the anti globalization left has been supplanted by the anti globalist rhetoric mostly associated with right wing populism globalism and globalization may have qualitatively different meanings but they nevertheless are interrelated although it is shortsighted there are core accuracies in the former s narrative that should be acknowledged the idea of a shadowy world government isn t exclusively adhered to by anti establishment conservatives and it is right to suspect there is a worldwide cabal of secretive billionaire power brokers controlling events behind the scenes there is indeed a new world order with zero regard for the sovereignty of nation states just as there is a deep state however it is a ruling class not of paranoiac imagination but real life and a right wing billionaire like robert mercer is as much a globalist as george soros ever since capitalism emerged it has always been global the current economic crisis is its latest cyclical downturn impoverishing and alienating working people whose increasing hardship is what has led to the trending rejection of the eu imperialism has exported capital leading to the destruction of jobs in the home sectors of western nations while outsourcing them to the third world over time deep disgruntlement among the working class has grown toward an economic system that is clearly rigged against them where the skewed distribution of capital gains and widespread tax evasion on the part of big business is camouflaged as buoyant economic growth when it came crashing down in the last recession the financial institutions responsible were bailed out using tax payer money instead of facing any consequences such grotesque unfairness has only been amplified by the austerity further transferring the burden from the 1 to the poor before the gilets jaunes the u k s brexit referendum in 2016 laid bare these deep class divisions within the european union one of the most significant events in the continent since wwii it has ultimately threatened to reshape the occident s status in the post war order as a whole brexit manifested out of divisions within britain s political parties especially the torys which had been plagued for years by internal dispute over the eu those in power were blind to the warning signs of discontent toward a world economy in crisis and were shocked by the plebiscite in which the working class defied the powers that be against all odds with more than half voting to leave in general well to do brits were hard remainers while those suffering most severely from the destruction of industry unemployment and austerity overwhelmingly chose to leave in what was described as a peasants revolt by the media the value of the pound sterling quickly plunged and not long after the status of the united kingdom as a whole came into question as britain found itself at odds with scotland s unanimous decision to remain brexit tugged at the bonds holding the eu together and suddenly the collective standing clout of its member states is at stake in a potential breakup of the entire bloc euroscepticism is also by no means a distinctly british phenomenon as distrust has soared in countries hit the hardest by neoliberalism like greece 80 with spain and france not far behind in fact before there was brexit there was fear among the elite of a grexit in response to its unprecedented debt crisis manufactured by the international monetary fund imf the greek people elected the coalition of the radical left syriza to a majority of legislative seats to the hellenic parliament during its 2015 bailout referendum unfortunately the synthetic alliance turned out to be anything but radical and a trojan horse of the establishment syriza was elected on its promise to rescind the terms of greek membership in the eu but shortly after taking office it betrayed its constituency and agreed to the troika s mass privatization even its former finance minister yanis varousfakis admitted that syriza was a controlled opposition and auxiliary of the soros foundation apart from suffering collective amnesia regarding the eu s neoliberal policies apparently the modern left is also in serious need of a history lesson regarding the federation s fascist origins it has been truly puzzling to see self proclaimed progressives mourning britain s decision to withdraw from a continental union that was historically masterminded by former fifth columnists of nazi germany it was in the aftermath of wwii s devastation that the 1951 treaty of paris established the nucleus of the eu in the european coal and steel community a cooperative union formed by france italy west germany and the three benelux states belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the europe declaration charter stated by the signature of this treaty the involved parties give proof of their determination to create the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organized europe this europe remains open to all european countries that have freedom of choice we profoundly hope that other countries will join us in our common endeavor the idea of forming a supranational union was conceived by the french statesman robert schuman who during the outbreak of wwii served as the under secretary of state for refugees in the reynaud government when nazi germany invaded france in 1940 schuman by all accounts willingly voted to grant absolute dictatorial powers to marshall philippe pétain to become head of state of the newly formed vichy government the puppet regime that ruled nazi occupied france until the allied invasion in 1944 by doing so he retained his position in parliament though he later chose to resign following the war like all vichy collaborators schuman was initially charged with the offense of indignité nationale national unworthiness and stripped of his civil rights as a traitor more than 4 000 alleged quislings were summarily executed following operation overlord and the normandy landings but the future eu designer was fortunate enough to have friends in high places schuman s clemency was granted by none other than general charles de gaulle himself the leader of the resistance during the war and future french president instantly schuman s turncoat reputation was rehabilitated and his wartime activity whitewashed even though he had knowingly voted full authority to pétain the retention of his post in the vichy government was veneered to have occurred somehow without his knowledge or consent marshal pétain meets with adolf hitler in 1940 schuman is officially regarded as one of the eleven men who were founding fathers of what later became the eu one of the other major figures that contributed to the federal integration of the continent was konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany the nuremberg trials may have tried and executed most of the top leadership of the nazi party but the post war government that became west germany was saturated with former third reich officials despite the purported post war denazification policy inscribed in the potsdam agreement many figures who had directly participated in the holocaust were appointed to high positions in adenauer s administration and never prosecuted for their atrocities one such war criminal was the former ministry of the interior and drafter of the nuremberg race statutes hans globke who became adenauer s right hand man as his secretary of state and chief of staff adenauer also successfully lobbied the allies to free most of the wehrmacht war criminals in their custody winning the support of then u s general and future president dwight eisenhower by 1951 motivated by the desire to quickly rearm and integrate west germany into nato in the new cold war the policy of denazification was prematurely ended and countless offenders were allowed to reenter branches of government military and public service their crimes against humanity took a backseat to the greater imperialist priority of rearmament against east germany and the soviets in the years following wwii there was also concern among the elite of anti americanism growing in western europe the annual bilderberg group conference was established in 1954 by prince bernard of the netherlands himself a former reiter ss corps and nazi party member to promote atlanticism and facilitate cooperation between american and european leaders invitations to the bilderberg club meetings were extended to only the most exclusive paragons in politics academia the media industry and finance in 2009 wikileaks revealed that it was at the infamous assembly where the hidden agenda of the european coal and steel community later the eu was set e european unity the discussion on this subject revealed general support for the idea of european integration and unification among the participants from the six countries of the european coal and steel community and a recognition of the urgency of the problem while members of the group held different views as to the method by which a common market could be set up there was a general recognition of the dangers inherent in the present divided markets of europe and the pressing need to bring the german people together with the other peoples of europe into a common market that the six countries of the coal and steel community had definitely decided to establish a common market and that experts were now working this out was felt to be a most encouraging step forward and it was hoped that other countries would subsequently join it prince bernard presides over the first annual bilderberg meeting in 1954 at the 1955 conference the rudimentary idea for a european currency or what became the eurozone was even discussed three years before the treaty of rome which established the european economic community without the public s knowledge a european speaker expressed concern about the need to achieve a common currency and indicated that in his view this necessarily implied the creation of a central political authority the mysterious bilderberg gatherings are still held to this day under notorious secrecy and are frequently the subject of wild speculation one can imagine a topic behind the scenes at this year s meeting would be how to address the growth of anti eu populism and uprisings like the gilet jaunes hitlerite expansionism had been carried out on the führer s vision for a european federation in the third reich in many respects the eu is a rebranded realization of his plans for empire building how ironic that liberals are clinging to a multinational political union founded by fascist colluders while the same economic bloc is being opposed by today s far right after its new islamophobic facelift while nationalism may have played an instrumental role in brexit there is a manufactured hysteria hatched by the establishment which successfully reduced the complex range of reasons for the leave eu vote to racism and flag waving they are now repeating this pattern by overstating the presence of the far right among the yellow vests such delirium not only demonizes workers but coercively repositions the left into supporting something it otherwise shouldn t the eu and by default its laissez faire policies thereby driving the masses further into the arms of the same far right echoes of this can be seen in the u s with the vapid response to journalist angela nagle s recent article about the immigration crisis on the southern border the faux left built a straw man in their attack on nagle who dared to acknowledge that the establishment only really wants open borders for an endless supply of low wage labor from regions in the global south destabilized by u s militarism and trade liberalization aligning itself with the hollow symbolic gestures of centrists has only deteriorated the standards of the left participating in such vacuousness and dragged down to the level of liberals there is no doubt brexit and trump pushed the xenophobia button and could not have come about without it however such criticism means nothing when it comes from moral posturers who claim to stand with refugees while supporting the very humanitarian interventionist policies displacing them nativism was not the sole reason the majority voted to leave the eu and many working class minorities also were brexiters of course their fellow workers and migrants are not the true cause of their misery after all it was not just chattel slaves who came to the u s unwillingly but european immigrants fleeing continental wars and starvation as well the crisis in the eu today is no different fundamentally migrants seek asylum on europe s doorstep because of nato s imperial expansion and the unexpected arrival of brexit has threatened to weaken the eu s military arm already desperate to reinvent itself and a new enemy in russia despite its functional obsolescence the shock of the referendum has inconveniently undermined nato s ability to pressure moscow and beijing a step forward for mitigating world peace in the long run and a silver lining to its outcome it is the task of the left to reject the eu s neoliberal project while transmitting the message that capital not refugees is the cause of the plight of the masses it is also necessary to have faith in the people something cynical liberals lack racism may historically be the achilles heel of the working class but underlying brexit the election of trump and the yellow vests is the spirit of defiance in working people albeit one of political confusion in need of guidance if the yellow vests are today s sans culottes like those which became the revolutionary partisans in the french revolution they will eventually need a jacobin club relatively progressive but ultimately reformist figures like mélenchon are no such spearhead and will only lead them down the same dead end of syriza the absence of any such vanguard has forced the working class to take matters into their own hands in the interim if history is any guide the gilets jaunes will be stamped out until a new cadre takes the reins whose objective is as lenin said not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries we also cannot fall into ideological fantasies that we live in permanent revolutionary circumstances or that a spontaneous uprising can become comprehensive simply because of ingenious leadership nevertheless as mao tse tung wrote a single spark can start a prairie fire and hopefully the yellow vests are that flame max

klarman in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues profit attribution by theme investment outlook summary september 20 2018 should mark the closing high for the s p 500 to end the second longest bull market in us history it should also mark the top of the everything bubble a term coined by investment newsletter writer jesse felder to describe historic valuations in every major asset class commodities being the one exception the everything bubble was courtesy of experimental global central bank policies in the wake of the great recession we think it is only the beginning of the asset bubble bursting process brought on by the sheer extent of the bubbles themselves in other words we are likely to face the real life playing out of economist hyman minsky s financial instability hypothesis which portends much more unwinding still to come there is a natural economic cycle including a natural business market liquidity and credit cycle which are all intertwined while no one can predict the lengths and inflection points of these cycles with perfect precision our goal is to time them as best we can to be prudent stewards of our clients capital and grow and protect it over the long term our macro model is telling us that the bull market has finally topped out for this cycle and that the economy will soon follow the central bank liquidity tide is going out while equities fixed income real estate and private asset vehicles are all at historic valuations we strongly believe there is still ample opportunity to capitalize on the everything bubble meltdown in 2019 through select shorts positions and proper defensive longs the extreme macro imbalances have only just begun to unwind based on record global leverage compared to global gdp only recent record us equity valuations across eight comprehensive measures recent record financial asset valuations relative to gdp in the us a record currency and credit bubble in china record currency and credit bubble in china historic housing bubbles in canada and australia record cheap valuations for precious metals and related mining stocks the second longest economic expansion and second longest bull market in us history recently historic us market top indicator levels on crescat s 16 factor macro model lack of widely recognized global recession with corresponding low equity market valuations investor despondency and capitulation necessary to signal a cyclical market bottom ecord global leverage global debt levels remain historically elevated and in most cases significantly higher than levels prior to the great recession looking at a list of all countries tracked by the bis and the imf almost half of them are above the 90th percentile today in terms of their historical total debt to gdp ratios see the chart below for the 26 economies today on the left panel that have debt to gdp at or above the levels that preceded those of the largest credit crises in the last 30 years the year country and debt levels that preceded those crises are shown in the right hand panel crescat s us macro model as part of our investment process we strongly rely on our own macro models to identify major cyclical market tops and bottoms our model below shows across sixteen indicators that the us stock market is highly vulnerable to a substantial further downturn that will lead the us and global economy into a cyclical recession we showed this model to the world on january 26 right before the first market selloff of this year leading crescat s hedge funds to industry leading performance in february even though the us stock market subsequently recovered its losses and pushed to new highs though september this model helped us to stay on course to remain net short us and global equities all year we benefitted tremendously from the recent decline in the 4th quarter in the s p 500 we also capitalized extremely well on international equity shorts particularly in china other asian and other emerging markets australia and canada throughout the year as we show in the current chart of our macro model below even now after the 4th quarter us stock market selloff our overall macro model indicator is only 7 percentile points down from its highest bubble rating ever hit for us stocks three months ago should we buy the recent dip no while there are likely to be normal bear market rallies after big down moves and we can try to hedge against these to some degree after such moves it should prove even more important not to get sucked into these bull traps when they happen we need to wait until the bear market has more fully played out and a recession has become widely acknowledged before we will want to get aggressively long again in this respect it should pay to follow our macro model and to recognize that today our indicator is still at least 78 percentile points away from signaling a possible market bottom how to avoid a value trap don t be fooled by talking heads who tell you that us stocks are cheap because of the forward p e multiple today in our prior quarterly research letters we showed eight fundamental metrics that proved that the us equity market was at record all time high valuations price to earnings multiples are a dangerous value trap given record unsustainable profit margins at the likely peak of an economic cycle the e in the forward p e multiple is likely to plunge as asset bubbles in the us in equities and corporate credit burst and the economy heads into recession it is imperative to look at cyclical and margin adjusted p e multiples to avoid value traps near the peak of a cycle margin adjusted capes reached all time highs in q3 2018 higher than the prior all time high in 1929 and the second highest at the peak of the tech bubble in 2000 source hussman strategic advisors global yield curve inversion the tightening policy by the fed has created critical imbalances in financial markets worldwide with fed funds rate at 2 4 we now have 13 countries with 30 year sovereign bonds that yield less than us overnight rates the number of economies with negative 30 year spreads relative to fed funds is unprecedented the rate one can earn from holding cash in the global reserve currency competes with all other assets in the global credit markets historically as we show in the chart below this has been a concerning development in credit markets that signals recession ahead in the us and globally the global yield curve inversion is highlighting a perceived flight to safety in global sovereign bonds despite their record low yields fed vs ecb monetary policy divergence among the flashing warning signals from credit markets worldwide the recent rate hike in us overnight rates illustrates a critical divergence in monetary policies between the fed and the ecb the chart below shows the spread between 3 month libor vs euribor spread now at its widest difference ever history shows that previous extremes followed policy reversals which importantly also coincided with the last two us stock market tops source bloomberg oil sending a signal about weakening demand in the global economy oil prices plunged in the last quarter of 2018 a move that crescat capitalized on in our hedge funds with short positions in individual oil exploration and production stocks identified by our model and short positions in both wti and brent crude oil futures in our global macro fund the oil price decline was the worst during a fed tightening cycle in the history of wti futures and occurred despite the telegraphing and announcement of a new opec supply cut during the quarter the oil decline is yet another one of many signs of the end of the business cycle as we show in the chart below it is interesting to note how all significant drops in the past also coincided with drastic fed policy change in the following months source bloomberg chasing utilities is typical at market tops to sum up how lazy today s common money manager is hedge funds and asset allocators at large have been crowding long and overweight into us utility stocks in an attempt to be defensive likewise market pundits have been coming on financial tv regularly in the last month telling investors to do the same apparently these groups are investing based on old broken market maxims rather than doing any research and analysis utilities are the most over valued sector in the us stock market today according to crescat s fundamental model importantly in the last two recessions utility stocks did not perform like a defensive sector at all the utilities select sector spdr etf xlu suffered a 46 drawdown from 2007 to 2009 and a 52 one from 2000 to 2002 in our view utility stocks could decline an even further in the coming bear market and recession given their record leverage and historic high valuations based on a combination of fundamental yield metrics such as sales to enterprise value free cash flow to enterprise value and book to price by the way utility sector aggregate free cash flow is negative in the last 4 quarters these companies cannot even make money at the likely top of a business cycle ugh the chart below shows the 12 month correlation between the s p 500 and utility stocks rising after reaching its most negative level since the start of the tech bust and the global financial crisis this is exactly how bear markets manifest first the s p 500 gets wobbly but utilities still rise then s p 500 crashes and utilities follow to the downside it appears to us that utility stocks have topped out for this cycle on 12 13 2018 just as investors piled into them they are down 6 3 since and we are happy to have taken the other side of that trade through xlu put options we think it is still very early in coming downturn for utility stocks source bloomberg breakout in gold to oil ratio sends macro signal another key macro inflection adds to our near term bearish conviction for us equities and corporate credit the moves between gold and oil is something we monitor closely for us the trend of this ratio serves as a bellwether to the stock market and the economy previous breakouts in gold versus oil have corresponded with stock market crashes and proved to be great times to play the ongoing widening of this spread the recent spike above its three year resistance line supports our views that there is further downside in equity markets globally the fed is likely done hiking interest rates for this cycle the downturn in global equity and credit markets that gained traction in q4 deserves close attention the three big developed market central banks are still acting like it is not a problem mario draghi just announced that the european central bank will finally end its qe this month while the bank of japan has been stealthily signaling an impending taper meanwhile the fed continues to signal further tightening in 2019 the fed funds futures market begs to differ and has sent an important signal of an impending business cycle downturn based on plunging yields over the last two months according to the fed funds futures market the probability of any interest rate hike at all in 2019 is now less than 10 the probably of a cut by the end of the year is now higher than the probability of a hike as shown in the table below investors should take note that the fed funds futures market is a much more reliable indicator than the fed s own dot plot which still shows two hikes in 2019 when it gets to meeting time the fed rarely likes to go against the futures market source bloomberg precious metals a deep value setup we strongly believe based on our valuation and timing models that we are on the precipice of a us equity market meltdown that could force the fed to act even more aggressively then post 2008 therefore for us there is no better time to own precious metals than now as prices are historically cheap relative to the global fiat monetary base which is now close to 19 trillion with the current valuation setup a looming fed stimulus cycle is extremely bullish for precious metals the chart below shows that commodities have underperformed the s p 500 for the last decade given how overvalued equity markets are we think this spread near historical low levels justifies our long exposure to precious metals in all our strategies as the primary commodity segment that will benefit from the impending stock market and economic downturn source bloomberg on the long side of our portfolios we think precious metals commodities and mining stocks can act as true defensive havens to not only protect capital but to capitalize on the upcoming bear market gold and silver mining companies own valuable gold in the ground and in many cases are producing and generating positive free cash flow today even at depressed gold and silver prices many of these stocks are deep value plays with significant upside potential the ratio of the s p 500 to the philadelphia stock exchange gold and silver index of mining stocks recently retested its early 2016 record extreme from which it rallied 200 in just 7 months the chart below illustrates this double top in the s p 500 versus gold and silver stocks precious metals mining companies have already begun to rise in q4 while the s p 500 declined all crescat s strategies benefited from this nascent move up in precious metals in the quarter we believe gold and silver are setting up for a major upward inflection source bloomberg corporate credit woes our research shows that non investment grade bonds so called junk are also historically overvalued with us corporate debt at record levels compared to gdp while the fed is tightening why are credit spreads near record lows this a classic sign of a market at its peak we researched further into the spdr bloomberg barclays high yield bond etf jnk holdings specifically a popular etf for high yield bonds in aggregate terms the ratio of net debt to free cash flow for all jnk public companies is now close to 28x it s hard to believe the cost of capital remains so cheap for businesses with such slim cash flow margins the following comparison is even more compelling for shorting junk bonds we find it interesting how etfs of investment grade bonds such as the ishares iboxx investment grade corporate bond etf lqd have already surpassed their 2016 lows while junk bond etfs like jnk are still well above it we have held put options on two junk bond etfs in our global macro hedge fund hyg and jnk in the fourth quarter and still do today we see this as an incredible opportunity to capitalize from a significant credit deterioration among high yield companies and the possibility of a re test of the early 2016 lows source bloomberg china the gray rhino in the room the chinese economy remains a large focus of ours and the recent turmoil in its equity markets confirms the legitimacy of our china credit bust thesis chinese stocks have now lost close to 3 6 trillion in market value accounting for close to 25 of its gdp in comparison with the great recession by the time us markets had lost similar amounts the economy was already in a deep recession we think that china is already in the midst of a recession despite its positive reported real gdp numbers we are seeing severe signs of credit tightness in china during the second part of the year shadow bank lending shrank at unprecedented levels this has been a major source of capital funding for chinese zombie companies source bloomberg the last m1 growth print in china was just about 32 basis points away for its all time lows m2 growth is also decelerating significantly now at its slowest pace in the history of the data if over half of global gdp growth for the last decade relied on china what should this be telling us about the current macro environment source bloomberg the chinese banking system now claims to own close to 40 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet as we have noted multiple times before china is sitting on a massively inflated currency and a credit bubble due to the vastly overstated value of these assets from years of not writing off non performing loans as us financial conditions continue to tighten the people s bank of china pboc is unable to act similarly resulting in significant monetary policy divergence for instance see below the spread between fed funds rate and shibor overnight rates at its widest level since 2008 this adds further pressure on the yuan to continue devaluing source bloomberg currency pegs can be stubborn but they ultimately fail based on their recent current account changes the chinese rmb hkd saudi riyal are some of the most overvalued currencies in the world today normally big declines in current accounts cause declines in exchange rates as the chart below reinforces the chart below shows what we believe to be a critical breakout the decoupling of gold vs offshore chinese yuan usdcnh is among the greatest macro trade opportunities in the world today with chinese equity markets in free fall it is becoming increasingly difficult for the pboc to prevent the yuan from devaluing against both gold and usd gold in yuan terms has recently re tested its 3 year breakout level bounced off its 200 day moving average and formed a golden cross technically this is an incredibly bullish setup both for gold and for yuan depreciation china s debt bomb is ticking faster and a yuan devaluation seems unavoidable source bloomberg we wish all our clients and followers the happiest of holidays and a healthy and prosperous new year sincerely kevin c smith cfa chief investment officer tavi costa global macro analyst sincerely crescat capital
trump is flirting with mutually assured economic destruction risk of financial crisis has grown new york financial markets have finally awoken to the fact that donald trump is us president given that the world has endured two years of reckless tweets and public statements by the world s most powerful man the obvious question is what took so long for one thing until now investors had bought into the argument that trump is all bark and no bite they were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as long as he pursued tax cuts deregulation and other policies beneficial to the corporate sector and shareholders and many trusted that at the end of the day the adults in the room would restrain trump and ensure that the administration s policies didn t jump the guardrails of orthodoxy these assumptions were more or less vindicated during trump s first year in office when economic growth and an expected increase in corporate profits owing to forthcoming tax cuts and deregulation resulted in strong stock market performance in 2017 us stock indices rose more than 20 percent but things changed radically in 2018 and especially in the last few months despite corporate earnings growing by over 20 percent thanks to the tax cuts us equity markets moved sideways for most of the year and have now taken a sharp turn south at this point broad indices are in correction territory meaning a 10 percent drop from the recent peak and indices of tech stocks such as the nasdaq are in bear market territory a drop of 20 percent or more though financial markets higher volatility reflects concerns about china italy and other eurozone economies and key emerging economies most of the recent turmoil is due to trump the year started with the enactment of a reckless tax cut that pushed up long term interest rates and created a sugar high in an economy already close to full employment as early as february growing concerns about inflation rising above the us federal reserve s two percent target led to the year s first risk off then came trump s trade wars with china and other key us trade partners market worries about the administration s protectionist policies have waxed and waned throughout the year but they are now reaching a new peak the latest us actions against china seem to augur a broader trade economic and geopolitical cold war an additional worry is that trump s other policies will have stagflationary effects reduced growth alongside higher inflation after all trump is planning to limit inward foreign direct investment and has already implemented broad restrictions on immigration which will reduce labor supply growth at a time when workforce aging and skills mismatches are already a growing problem moreover the administration has yet to propose an infrastructure plan to spur private sector productivity or hasten the transition to a green economy and on twitter and elsewhere trump has continued to bash corporations for their hiring production investment and pricing practices singling out tech firms just when they are already facing a wider backlash and increased competition from their chinese counterparts emerging markets have also been shaken by us policies fiscal stimulus and monetary policy tightening have pushed up short and long term interest rates and strengthened the us dollar as a result emerging economies have experienced capital flight and rising dollar denominated debt those that rely heavily on exports have suffered the effects of lower commodity prices and all that trade even indirectly with china have felt the effects of the trade war even trump s oil policies have created volatility after the resumption of us sanctions against iran pushed up oil prices the administration s efforts to carve out exemptions and bully saudi arabia into increasing its own production led to a sharp price drop though us consumers benefit from lower oil prices us energy firms stock prices do not besides excessive oil price volatility is bad for producers and consumers alike because it hinders sensible investment and consumption decisions making matters worse it is now clear that the benefits of last year s tax cuts have accrued almost entirely to the corporate sector rather than to households in the form of higher real inflation adjusted wages that means household consumption could soon slow down further undercutting the economy more than anything else though the sharp fall in us and global equities during the last quarter is a response to trump s own utterances and actions even worse than the heightened risk of a full scale trade war with china despite the recent truce agreed with chinese president xi jinping are trump s public attacks on the fed which began as early as the spring of 2018 when the us economy was growing at more than four percent given these earlier attacks markets were spooked this month when the fed correctly decided to hike interest rates while also signaling a more gradual pace of rate increases in 2019 most likely the fed s relative hawkishness is a reaction to trump s threats against it in the face of hostile presidential tweets fed chair jerome powell needed to signal that the central bank remains politically independent but then came trump s decision to shut down large segments of the federal government over congress s refusal to fund his useless mexican border wall that sent markets into a near panic and the government shutdown was soon followed by reports that trump wants to fire powell a move that could turn a correction into a crash just before the christmas holiday us treasury secretary steven mnuchin was forced to issue a public statement to placate the markets he announced that trump was not planning to fire powell after all and that us banks finances are sound effectively highlighting the question of whether they really are recent changes within the administration that do not necessarily affect economic policymaking are also rattling the markets the impending departure of white house chief of staff john kelly and secretary of defense james mattis will leave the room devoid of adults the coterie of economic nationalists and foreign policy hawks who remain will cater to trump s every whim as matters stand the risk of a full scale geopolitical conflagration with china cannot be ruled out a new cold war would effectively lead to de globalization disrupting supply chains everywhere but particularly in the tech sector as the recent zte and huawei cases signal at the same time trump seems to be hell bent on undermining the cohesion of the european union and nato at a time when europe is economically and politically fragile and special counsel robert mueller s investigation into trump s 2016 election campaign s ties to russia hangs like a sword of damocles over his presidency trump is now the dr strangelove of financial markets like the paranoid madman in stanley kubrick s classic film he is flirting with mutually assured economic destruction now that markets see the danger the risk of a financial crisis and global recession has grown nouriel roubini is professor of economics at the stern school of business new york

the power of hindsight s a wonderful thing and in currency markets and understanding of where fx rates have been and why is central to formulating forecasts with any semblance of accuracy for example the fact that the british pound to euro exchange rates have remained constrained in a just over 5 range throughout the whole of 2018 speaks volumes about underlying fundamentals with bilateral investor uncertainty pulling the exchange rate in opposing directions while the pound to euro exchange rates have been trapped between 1 10 and 1 16 through the year extending back to october 2017 price action within the range has been anything but muted with dramatic intraday and intra week price swings par for the 2018 course as hard economic data has been somewhat overshadowed by politics and sensational headlines particularly around brexit january pound sterling surges into 2018 on tight labour market and brexit breakthrough the start of 2018 saw the pound sterling gbp appreciate substantially not just against the euro eur but versus a host of peer currencies including the us dollar usd where greenback weakness allowed the gbp usd exchange rate to hit its highest levels since the brexit referendum economic data remained on a strong footing with unemployment remaining close to 40 year lows and while headline inflation cpi outstripped wage growth 3 versus 2 5 manufacturing and services pmis remained squarely above 50 in expansion territory given robust economic data paired with a strong labour market several pundits suggested a further 25bps following november s quarter point rate hike could be on the cards for the bank of england s boe s monetary policy committee mpc economist john hawksworth commented if this pattern of solid jobs growth and a gradual pick up in earnings growth were to persist through the year then this could push the mpc towards a further interest rate rise later in 2018 during january pm may conducted a cabinet reshuffle putting in place a team she felt well equipped to tackle brexit and the eu withdrawal bill passed its first reading in the house of commons which coupled with the positive underlying data saw the pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate appreciate 2 5 in just over a week to hit a 7 month high of 1 1507 advertisement above pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate january 2018 investor concerns although not at the frantic levels we ve witnessed rocking exchange rates towards the latter part of the year were also somewhat allayed by comments from boe governor mark carney who suggested the central bank remained unbiased with regards to brexit outcomes speaking in the house of lords he said we don t have a bias in terms of the outcome we look at the economic forces however the negotiations go how it affects the exchange rate how it affects the supply side of the economy and how it affects demand adding that clarity would likely stimulate business investment similarly the euro entered the year on buoyant growth and expectations that underlying inflation could pick up amidst record measures of quantitative easing while president of the european central bank ecb mario draghi tried to play down the euro commenting on volatility as a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring markets paid no heed sending the euro to 3 year highs versus the us dollar eurusd data throughout the month however took a negative shade as german inflation missed forecasts and overall eurozone inflation contracted to 1 3 its lowest level since july of 2017 and a step away from the ecb s 2 0 target analysts from ing commented even though the euroboom has continued into 2018 inflation is showing few signs of picking up if 2018 is supposed to be the year of inflation returning it s hiding its start pretty well february gbp eur ping pong as german business confidence takes a hit boe hint at rates hike volatility upped a gear in february with the pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate ricocheting between the upper and lower bounds of the 1 15 to 1 10 range amidst boe forecast adjustments mpc member comments and a mixed bag of economic data both for the pound sterling and euro above pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate february 2018 the start of the month saw the pound sterling pressured lower against the euro as the uk services pmi fell to 16 month lows of 53 0 and construction pmi printed a barely expanding 50 2 beginning to underscore the economic impact of brexit the uk s goods trade balance also widened to 13 6b the highest level in 16 months uk wages also remained stifled printing 2 5 for the three months to december and remaining stubbornly below inflation 3 0 compounding pressure the international monetary fund s imf latest assessment of the uk economy stated that productivity was below expectations meanwhile in the eurozone german chancellor angela merkel secured a coalition government boosting eurozone optimism while french german and euro wide pmis missed forecasts without exception yet remained considerably above 50 neutral given germany s prominence in the eurozone s economic activity euro sentiment took a blow on dropping german business confidence which contracted to 115 4 from 117 6 president of the institute for economic research ifo clemens fuest commented companies were less satisfied with their current business situation but the indicator was at its second highest level since 1991 the redeeming factor for the pound sterling came from a surprisingly upbeat boe with upwards revisions of growth forecasts and while the official bank rate remained unchanged at 0 5 an indication that rates could be hiked within the year on mpc member dave ramsden s comments that relative to where i was i see the case for rates rising somewhat sooner rather than somewhat later march pound appreciates ahead of article 50 ecb pessimism italian politics weigh on euro while thus far brexit and the possibilities and uncertainties therein had certainly factored in to investor considerations following the decimation of the pound sterling in the immediate aftermath of the in out eu referendum price action in march began once again to highlight brexit as a central driver for the gbp eur exchange rate as trade talks between uk and eu officials prompted brexit optimism and in turn an appreciating gbp overall the month saw the pound sterling appreciate steadily against the euro following a year to date low of 1 1147 early in the month to highs of 1 1525 during the most persistent gbp rally of the year 12 consecutive days some key brexit developments helped drive the pound sterling rally in the run up to the triggering of article 50 the house of lords amended the brext bill to include a meaningful vote in the house of commons while chancellor of the exchequer phillip hammond announced a 26b brexit cushion to protect the economy the concept of a divorce settlement was at the media forefront as eu officials floated figures in the tens of billions

front runners yet failed to garner enough support to form a majority government alone commenting on the impact and outlook for the euro in light of the italian election fc exchanges ben scott commented the currency market has been relatively accepting of the political deadlock in italy but if the five star movement were to come into power there could be some rocky days ahead for the euro as there have been previous murmurings from the party of an eu referendum once again the boe boosted the gbp through march while the mpc maintained the official bank rate at 0 50 at their march

euro was also at the mercy of investors second guessing central bank policy in the wake of dovish ecb comments in march applying pressure on the euro as market pricing reflected a continuation of accommodative monetary policy acknowledging a recent spate of weak eurozone data releases prompting investor concerns of an economic slowdown draghi commented don t get me wrong we are concerned about

purchases program may choppy price action as uk and eu ecostats miss forecasts boe downgrade forecasts pound sterling to euro gbp eur price action became increasingly choppy in may with three distinct rallies and retracements within the range the initial gbp rally preceded the boe s may 10th bank rates release and policy summary while a static rate release was in line with the general consensus

may 2018 economic data in the uk was mixed and while investors welcomed the recovery of the construction pmi which returned to expansion levels at 52 5 from 47 0 and new employment entrants surged

with a q1 release of 2 5 y y with german data significantly down at 0 3 q q political uncertainty underpinned a large portion of the eurozone s economic activity as coalition talks in germany weighed on investor sentiment down to 19 2 from 19 6 and german economic activity with factory orders up 3 1 missing a forecast for 5 commenting on the downturn fc exchange s ben scott wrote germany the powerhouse of the currency bloc has produced some lacklustre ecostats in recent months and if this continues investors are likely to become concerned that it s not just a temporary slowdown within

financial markets have left their mark on the economic outlook for germany on top of this german industry has been reporting worse than expected figures for exports production and incoming orders for

unsurprisingly the ecb maintained the main refinancing rate at 0 00 with draghi highlighting uncertainties over the global trade environment as a prominent concern while q1 and q2 economic data for the uk supported an expectation of a boe hike disappointing economic statistics from mid july on threw a spanner in the works with pound sterling fx pairs muted amid ambiguity august boe rate hike expectations for no deal brexit grow the start of august saw the pound sterling spike briefly against the euro as the bank of england s mpc voted unanimously to hike interest rates above 0 50 for the first time since the financial crisis accompanying minutes said recent data appear to confirm that the dip in output in the first quarter was temporary with momentum recovering in the second quarter

projected to fall a little further uk pmis fluctuated but all remained above 50 with the construction index hitting a 14 month high at 55 8 despite the rate hike and promising economic data the gbp eur exchange rate failed to retake the 1 13 level as market participants digested the distinctly brexit coupled concerns raised by the mpc the mpc continues to recognise that the economic outlook

confidence fell and retail sales registered a 0 4 monthly contraction fears over the fallout from the turkish lira rout helped to subdue the euro towards the end of the month the gbpeur x rate

partnership such as there never has been with any other third country september sterling tumbles as pm may adopts hard stance with eu leaders in september the pound to euro gbpeur exchange rate traded between a 1 1048 low and 1 1301 with price action become increasingly dictated by brexit spurred headlines with spells of muted price action interspersed with bouts of high volatility as political

despite a static forecast of 2 4 boe governor carney announced his intention to extend his tenure until the end of january 2020 to continue to work on economically preparing for and reacting the the fallout from brexit this came as bank stress tests indicated uk banks would be able to withstand extreme economic conditions with carney commenting our job after all is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst while banks were deemed to be adequately provisioned carney warned that should the uk exit the eu in a disorderly manner house prices could decline by as much as 35 while the sterling would likely slump and inflation soar doing little to allay investor concerns in a devastating blow the pound sterling pm may took a hard line stance during a speech at an informal summit of

the year ahead breaching eu regulations and threatening to prompt a dispute between italy and the eu commission chief economist at global reach eimear daly said gbp eur trade is dictated by politics on both sides of the english channel gbp continues to be at the mercy of brexit headlines while the short term focus for the eur is italy s rebuke of euro area national budget targets adding over the course of october gbp eur trade is likely to be highly volatile october brexit deal deadline missed but hopes remain for pre december agreement despite the growing chances of a no deal brexit the pound sterling gbp appreciated in the early part of october versus the euro eur with the x rate retaking the 1 13 level and even rising above 1 14 for several days before returning to the downside for a slow and steady decline through mid and late october above pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate october 2018 the 3m y average earnings index provided some support for the gbp with wage growth accelerating at its fastest pace in 9 years but the buoying effect was short lived as headline inflation continued to lag at 2 4 and retail sales contracted significantly by 0 8 having missed the october deadline for a brexit deal and a november summit not on the cards due to the lack of progress between uk and eu negotiators warranted concerns over the future of brexit held the gbp down however brexit secretary dominic raab commented that an agreement was in the works and could be finalised within weeks at the tail end of the month eurozone growth fell to its lowest level in over 4 years as italian economic stagnation dragged down expansion the italian budget remained an area of contention with the threat of excessive deficit procedures seeming increasingly likely as italy s new populist government pursued their budget agenda to the dismay of the wider eu political uncertainty in germany also became apparent as current chancellor angela merkel announced she would be throwing in the towel at the end of her current term combined these factors allowed for a late month gbp rally into early november november extremely volatile price acton amidst political turmoil november pushed the boundaries of volatility with the pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate at the mercy of sensational political turmoil the pound sterling appreciated versus the single currency early in the month as the boe maintained rates and iterated their stance as ready to adapt to economic impacts of brexit whichever scenario unfolded a slew of high profile tory resignations in protest of pm may s proposed withdrawal agreement including the current brexit secretary dominic raab and mep jacob rees mogg alongside the submission of letters of no confidence in pm may highlighted government fragility prompting the worst single trading day for the sterling since october 2016 as the gbp eur plummeted 1 85 in hours above pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate november 2018 however the pound managed a partial recover following the november 22nd announcement that the uk and eu negotiations had yielded a treaty which received mutual technical agreement president of the european commission donald tusk broke the news tweeting i have just sent to eu27 a draft political declaration on the future relationship between eu and uk the commission president has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators level and agreed in principle at political level subject to the endorsement of the leaders shortly thereafter pm may confirmed the development to a packed house of commons stating we have an agreed text between the uk and european commission going on she earmarked december 11th for the required meaningful vote affording mps in the house of commons the opportunity to vote for or against the current agreement exchanges between uk and eu officials took on a contentious nature as eu leaders stood shoulder to shoulder drawing red lines ahead of transition period negotiations macron said the european council will demonstrate particular vigilance as regards safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens the necessity to maintain ambitious level playing field conditions and to protect fishing enterprises and coastal communities bringing the total of cabinet resignations to 7 sam gyinah minister for universities resigned in protest over may s brexit deal he said it has become increasingly clear to me that the proposed deal is not in the british national interest and that to vote for this deal is to set ourselves up for failure we will be losing not taking control of our national destiny november was a month in which risk factors for the uk and eu were weighed against each other with investors opting for the least negative rather than the most positive as political uncertainties on both sides of the channel weighed on their respective currencies while the g20 summit in argentina yielded some good news for global trade with us and chinese presidents agreeing to a 90 day ceasefire in their ongoing trade war french president emmanuel macron returned home to violent yellow vest anti tax protestors germany continued its run of disappointing economic activity with third quarter growth printing 0 2 the lowest level since 2015 german gdp y y shrunk to 1 1 compared to a previous reading of 2 3 while overall eurozone growth for

brexit developments maintained centre stage driving sporadic periods of extremely volatile price action above pound sterling euro gbp eur exchange rate november 2018 verbal sparring continued between the uk and eu with donald tusk stating if this deal is rejected in the commons we are left with as was already stressed a few weeks ago by prime minister may an alternative no deal or no brexit at all a round of 5 days parliamentary debates centred on the tabled brexit withdrawal agreement commenced early in the month with the government being found in contempt of parliament for the first time in british history over their refusal to fully divulge brexit legal advice obtained with pm may being ordered to immediately release in full the advice highlighting the already deeply divisive issue of the irish backstop solution the legal advice pointed to the risk of the arrangement enduring indefinitely meaning the uk could be tied into a customs union with the eu with little leverage in future negotiations to end the arrangement throwing a spanner in the works for pm may s desperate attempt to portray her deal or no deal as the only viable routes forward the european court of justice s advocate general commented that the uk should be able if it chooses to unilaterally revoke the triggering of article 50 abandoning the brext process altogether adding wind to the sails of pro eu and second referendum or peoples vote backers while initially refusing to consider a postponement to the meaningful vote despite calls from within her cabinet and parliamentary arithmetic pointing to an overwhelming defeat for the withdrawal bill pm may eventually bowed to pressure calling off the vote at the 11th hour and sending gbp fx rates tumbling staving off a motion of no confidence from within her own party pm may returned to brussels in an attempt to seek legally binding assurances over key issues hampering domestic support for her withdrawal agreement while originally receptive to pm may s request eu officials quickly reneged on their commitment to provide assurances in light of pm may s vagueness with juncker describing the debates as nebulous and imprecise on the data front wage growth in the uk outpaced inflation with a 3m y increase of 3 3 while manufacturing output printed a significant decline of 0 9 m m and gdp for the three months to october rose 0 4 moderating from the previous 0 6 printing european data did little to alleviate concerns of a slowdown in the bloc with french german and overall eu pmis all missing forecasts and the french pmis contracting below the significant 50 level german business sentiment also continued to deteriorate slumping to its lowest level in over 2 years amid trade concerns and the rising threat of a no deal brexit early 2019 gbp eur underpinned by brexit as deadlines loom overall 2018 has seen political uncertainties pushed to the forefront of market pricing of subjective currencies with brexit dominating the pound sterling s fx value and myriad internal concerns over the eu s economic performance and political stability significantly hampering euro recovery efforts looking ahead there s seems little reason to see this changing as brexit remains unresolved as we head into the new year while concessions from the eu have been lacking in key areas of contention a meaningful vote is due to take place on pm may s brexit withdrawal bill in january with the outcome likely to heavily impact the pound sterling for europe lacklustre economic data continues to highlight the bloc s vulnerability to a slowdown and the ecb s response to the growing body of evidence will be a key focal point for investors alongside the upcoming european elections may given the wave of populist sentiment developing in several member states the gbp eur exchange rate hinges on the brexit outcome with a smooth orderly exit from the eu likely to push the x rate above the 1 16 resistance level upside potential in the event of a soft brexit is unanimous among institutional forecasts with bank of america merrill lynch suggesting the gbp is currently undervalued by 15 to 20 on the flip side should political gridlock filibuster the process into a hard brexit by default the 1 11 support level looks likely to see a downside break with several institutional forecasts predicting gbp eur parity
financial markets have finally awoken to the fact that donald trump is us president given that the world has endured two years of reckless tweets and public statements by the world s most powerful man the obvious question is what took so long for one thing until now investors had bought into the argument that trump is all bark and no bite they were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt as long as he pursued tax cuts deregulation and other policies beneficial to the corporate sector and shareholders and many trusted that at the end of the day the adults in the room would restrain trump and ensure that the administration s policies didn t jump the guardrails of orthodoxy these assumptions were more or less vindicated during trump s first year in office when economic growth and an expected increase in corporate profits owing to forthcoming tax cuts and deregulation resulted in strong stock market performance in 2017 us stock indices rose more than 20 per cent but things changed radically in 2018 and especially in the last few months despite corporate earnings growing by over 20 per cent thanks to the tax cuts us equity markets moved sideways for most of the year and have now taken a sharp turn south at this point broad indices are in correction territory meaning a 10 per cent drop from the recent peak and indices of tech stocks such as the nasdaq are in bear market territory a drop of 20 per cent or more though financial markets higher volatility reflects concerns about china italy and other eurozone economies and key emerging economies most of the recent turmoil is due to trump the year started with the enactment of a reckless tax cut that pushed up long term interest rates and created a sugar high in an economy already close to full employment as early as february growing concerns about inflation rising above the us federal reserve s 2 per cent target led to the year s first risk off then came trump s trade wars with china and other key us trade partners market worries about the administration s protectionist policies have waxed and waned throughout the year but they are now reaching a new peak the latest us actions against china seem to augur a broader trade economic and geopolitical cold war an additional worry is that trump s other policies will have stagflationary effects reduced growth alongside higher inflation after all trump is planning to limit inward foreign direct investment and has already implemented broad restrictions on immigration which will reduce labour supply growth at a time when workforce aging and skills mismatches are already a growing problem moreover the administration has yet to propose an infrastructure plan to spur private sector productivity or hasten the transition to a green economy and on twitter and elsewhere trump has continued to bash corporations for their hiring production investment and pricing practices singling out tech firms just when they are already facing a wider backlash and increased competition from their chinese counterparts emerging markets have also been shaken by us policies fiscal stimulus and monetary policy tightening have pushed up short and long term interest rates and strengthened the us dollar as a result emerging economies have experienced capital flight and rising dollar denominated debt those that rely heavily on exports have suffered the effects of lower commodity prices and all that trade even indirectly with china have felt the effects of the trade war even trump s oil policies have created volatility after the resumption of us sanctions against iran pushed up oil prices the administration s efforts to carve out exemptions and bully saudi arabia into increasing its own production led to a sharp price drop though us consumers benefit from lower oil prices us energy firms stock prices do not besides excessive oil price volatility is bad for producers and consumers alike because it hinders sensible investment and consumption decisions making matters worse it is now clear that the benefits of last year s tax cuts have accrued almost entirely to the corporate sector rather than to households in the form of higher real inflation adjusted wages that means household consumption could soon slow down further undercutting the economy more than anything else though the sharp fall in us and global equities during the last quarter is a response to trump s own utterances and actions even worse than the heightened risk of a full scale trade war with china despite the recent truce agreed with chinese president xi jinping are trump s public attacks on the fed which began as early as the spring of 2018 when the us economy was growing at more than 4 per cent given these earlier attacks markets were spooked this month when the fed correctly decided to hike interest rates while also signaling a more gradual pace of rate increases in 2019 most likely the fed s relative hawkishness is a reaction to trump s threats against it in the face of hostile presidential tweets fed chair jerome powell needed to signal that the central bank remains politically independent but then came trump s decision to shut down large segments of the federal government over congress s refusal to fund his useless mexican border wall that sent markets into a near panic and the government shutdown was soon followed by reports that trump wants to fire powell a move that could turn a correction into a crash just before the christmas holiday us treasury secretary steven mnuchin was forced to issue a public statement to placate the markets he announced that trump was not planning to fire powell after all and that us banks finances are sound effectively highlighting the question of whether they really are recent changes within the administration that do not necessarily affect economic policymaking are also rattling the markets the impending departure of white house chief of staff john kelly and secretary of defense james mattis will leave the room devoid of adults the coterie of economic nationalists and foreign policy hawks who remain will cater to trump s every whim as matters stand the risk of a full scale geopolitical conflagration with china cannot be ruled out a new cold war would effectively lead to de globalization disrupting supply chains everywhere but particularly in the tech sector as the recent zte and huawei cases signal at the same time trump seems to be hell bent on undermining the cohesion of the european union and nato at a time when europe is economically and politically fragile and special counsel robert mueller s investigation into trump s 2016 election campaign s ties to russia hangs like a sword of damocles over his presidency trump is now the dr strangelove of financial markets he is flirting with mutually assured economic destruction now that markets see the danger the risk of a financial crisis and global recession has grown project syndicate
open this photo in gallery an oilfield pumpjack works on an oil well belonging to cenovus energy near brooks alberta larry macdougal the canadian press economists caught off guard by a robust canadian economy in 2017 kept their forecasts solid but unspectacular for 2018 and pretty much came in on target equity strategists however largely missed the mark as they predicted a year of solid but unspectacular gains in canadian stocks leaving most canadians who shared that optimism poorer these are the takeaways in our annual look back at predictions for canada s economy and markets a year ago canadian economists were explaining how they d underestimated the country s consumers who propped up the economy as they kept on spending this year they mostly reiterated their goldilocks forecasts not too hot not too cold and the economic numbers came in just right after a very robust 2017 we were expecting a slowdown in growth to something more sustainable said craig wright chief economist at rbc dominion securities inc as the economy s pushing up against capacity there s a natural tendency to slow mr wright s forecast of 1 9 per cent gdp growth for 2018 tied for the lowest of six forecasts among the big banks economists may turn out slightly conservative with three quarters of numbers in the gdp figure for the full year should settle in around 2 per cent rbc s current estimate to 2 1 per cent the estimation by the folks at bmo nesbitt burns inc the economics squad at cibc world markets inc was in the middle of the pack for forecasts on gdp and inflation while also predicting the lowest unemployment rate and the weakest canadian dollar and it seems poised to come very close in nearly all of its predictions overall not bad at all in terms of accuracy said chief economist avery shenfeld who generously examined his errors a year ago and is now allowed to note his successes mr shenfeld allows that cibc was pessimistic on oil too pessimistic in terms of the annual average as were all of the bank economists the national bank economics team whose forecast also included 2 5 per cent gdp growth was the highest with a prediction of us 60 west texas intermediate wti crude oil we felt that u s production would zoom ahead and that opec and russia would ease their prior production restraint both of which in fact happened mr shenfeld said douglas porter of bank of montreal who forecast an average wti price of us 57 a barrel for 2018 versus us 50 91 in 2017 noted that bmo looked overly cautious for much of the year not so bad now he believes the full year average will end up being just under us 65 after peaking above us 75 in early october yet falling below us 50 in the last days of december while the economists can be generally satisfied with their forecasts stock pickers most of whom predicted a year of meaningful gains for the s p tsx composite have to look back on 2017 and re examine assumptions in the reuters global equities poll conducted in october 2017 when the composite bounced around the 15 800 mark the median end of 2018 projection of 26 forecasts was 16 750 a gain of about 6 per cent for the year many forecasts topped 17 000 and some exceeded 18 000 the composite closed 2018 on monday at 14 322 86 in an e mail last week manash goswami senior vice president and portfolio manager at first asset investment management inc explained his firm s 18 200 year end 2018 forecast from october 2017 mr goswami said most economic data in canada and the united states showed positive trends corporations were posting strong growth in revenue and profits oil seemed to be on the upswing and central banks in canada and the united states were raising rates two things that should have boosted energy and financial stocks each a huge contributor to the composite given this backdrop we did not think it was unreasonable for the tsx to continue to trade at an elevated multiple he said we thought a 5 per cent return for the balance of 2017 and 5 per cent to 10 per cent return in 2018 were reasonable expectations we were fully invested and favoured more pro cyclical sectors such as financials industrials and technology around the middle of 2018 this view changed he said we began to see slowing in economic data equity markets outside of north america including china europe were rolling over coupled with global trade war risk u s china and nafta uncertainty we became more cautious and started to become more defensive in our sector allocations favouring sectors such as utilities and real estate as well as raising our cash weight to about 30 per cent ron meisels of phases cycles inc a firm that does technical analysis of stocks was one of the closest forecasting 14 500 for the end of 2018 he looked at the macro thesis for an aging bull market that suggested the sectors that typically outperform energy and financials and gold also dominate the composite but then he looked at technical indicators for each of those sectors and came away unimpressed with their 2018 potential gold equities for example were falling under a major downtrend line and under its own 200 day moving average technically speaking it was a very weak condition matthew skipp president and chief investment officer of sw8 asset management inc forecast 14 250 he says he was somewhat cynical about many economic and financial measures underlying canadian equity markets such as the transportation problems and cracks in the housing market and he was concerned about global markets and valuations in general and the lack of a correction in u s markets specifically however like a true contrarian he said last week if i made a bit of an outlier call to the downside last year i think the markets in canada and the united states are in the process of trying to find a short term bottom when you re interviewing the guy with the call to the downside it s probably a decent sign of a short term bottom

after the jitters that accompanied the end of 2018 policymakers weigh in with their prognostications about a year that could pose even greater challenges 2019 is set to mark a crucial turning point for thailand s economy with external headwinds and domestic uncertainties poised to spoil the new year s celebration by potentially causing a downturn in economic growth although the much awaited general election will likely usher a boost of confidence and joy among investors and consumers numerous domestic and external factors promise a bumpy ride for all stakeholders this year thailand s much touted strength in its economic fundamentals will more than likely be tested by continuous adverse effects from the sino us trade disputes protracted brexit negotiations and global financial volatility induced by monetary policy tightening and rising interest rates on the domestic front exports and tourism seen as champions helping to propel economic growth over the past few years are expected to record a slowdown as downside risks cast a shadow over growth prospects in these lucrative sectors of the thai economy compounding domestic economic woes are high household debt the uncertain competitiveness of small and medium sized enterprises smes and the greying demography from financial regulators to chieftains of commerce and exports here are the thoughts of prominent thai policymakers on the economic outlook this year veerathai santiprabhob governor bank of thailand with the us china trade spat dampening global demand and the underlying momentum weakening to some extent the central bank remains confident that thailand s economy will continue to grow at its potential in 2019 and the external position is solid although the country s economy is forecast to grow at a slower pace in 2019 it can still expand at close to potential because investment and consumption are gaining speed mr veerathai said it s the first time in a decade when the economy has expanded at 4 for two straight years he said it suggests a stronger economy after the country s economy grew at a slower pace of 3 3 year on year during the july to september quarter and amid the heightening trade row between the world s two biggest economies the bank of thailand in december trimmed its economic gdp forecast to 4 2 growth for 2018 from 4 4 predicted earlier and to 4 this year from 4 2 previously the payment based export growth projection for 2018 was cut to 3 7 from 5 5 predicted in september while the forecast for this year was kept unchanged at 4 1 a public investment delay will also dampen the country s economic expansion the central bank cut the growth forecast for state investment in 2018 from 6 1 projected in september to 4 6 and from 7 7 to 6 6 for this year capital and financial markets wild swings are apt to continue in 2019 due to the monetary policy normalisation of several central banks eliminating fragility on the domestic front is the central bank s crucial task if it wants to prevent hefty capital outflows mr veerathai said adding that if foreign investors view thailand as fragile the baht will no longer be a safe haven currency both the state and the private sector globally are experiencing higher leverage while geopolitical tensions also warrant monitoring he said pointing to protests in some european countries and uncertainty surrounding brexit and the middle east on the domestic front vulnerabilities are seen in big companies and credit cooperatives so the central bank is building buffers mr veerathai said big companies have borrowed cheaply for riskier investments president stock exchange of thailand 2019 will be another year full of challenges and opportunities while the us china trade conflicts and tighter monetary condition may continue to dampen global economic growth and lower investors risk appetite there are still opportunities for thailand due to the country s strong economic fundamentals and future growth potential mr pakorn said here are the thai capital market s key themes in 2019 amid global financial volatility the thai economy is well insulated given the country s strong domestic demand as seen by 5 growth in third quarter private consumption low public debt and ample international reserves a shift towards domestic growth drivers will likely continue mr pakorn said thailand 4 0 and the eastern economic corridor investment plan will help enhance economic growth and investment s curve industry investment in advanced automotive aviation and robotics will bring thailand to the fourth development era and sustain high economic growth ratios for decades to come with improvement in growth comes investors confidence and risk appetite which should help bring capital that had flown out back into the economy and domestic capital market mr pakorn said with strong economic growth anticipated demand for capital for investment will increase and become more diverse over the past five years our market capitalisation has been expanding with new initial public offerings at around 250 billion baht per year mr pakorn said we are also expanding into family as well as sme and multinational businesses as there has been growing demand in recent years while promoting the market of well being sectors businesses related to agriculture commerce fashion food and beverages healthcare transport and logistics and tourism and leisure which are thailand s competitiveness thailand plays a central role in bridging opportunities for investors and regional markets the set has recently launched the first depository receipts on a vietnamese exchange traded fund allowing thai investors to explore vietnam s growth potential as trade and investment become more interconnected linking capital markets in cambodia laos myanmar vietnam and thailand seems to be the next logical step mr pakorn said in future investors will want a more diverse range of products and mutual funds wealth management businesses will have to prepare for the imminent changes at the set we have been focusing on analysing investors data to enhance services and efficiency and meet stakeholders needs through regulatory reforms transforming infrastructure into open platforms as well as promoting investment tools and education mr pakorn said in sum in 2019 and going forward all businesses have to transform themselves to catch up with challenging factors that will affect the global economy such as technological disruption changing consumer behaviour demographic and psychographic elements and globalisation the set s ongoing efforts to bring together all stakeholders will bring stability and benefits to society and the economy in the long run he said chairman thai chamber of commerce thailand s economy is likely to face myriad thorny challenges in 2019 despite continued growth of more than 4 in 2018 according to mr kalin the world s economy is expected to grow on a par with 2018 s rate or slightly lower while the thai economy is forecast to grow in a range of 4 4 3 in 2019 as projected by the joint standing committee on commerce industry and banking mr kalin said but still there is a spate of uncertainties and risk factors be it the international political conflicts especially among the big markets such as the united states china european union and britain stiffer competition in the traditional market higher oil prices or relatively low farm prices the international monetary fund imf in october forecast 3 7 global growth in both 2018 and 2019 down from its july forecast of 3 9 growth for each year according to mr kalin other challenges include limitations on infrastructure such as the adequacy or readiness of airports facilities to accommodate tourist arrivals effective water management international trade customs linkage and the readiness of skilled workers in handling the government s new initiatives such as the government s flagship eastern economic corridor eec foreign exchange is another area of concern he said citing the baht s strength making thai products less competitive domestic trade meanwhile is also expected to see more intensified competition in 2019 thanks to an anticipated influx of cheap products from china and customers tendency to buy more products online integration of working processes seamless collaboration among state agencies and ministries legal amendments to facilitate trade and ease of doing business and educational reforms are desperately needed to cater to changing business industry and trade environments mr kalin said he also expressed concerns about the rising policy rate and the single account scheme that could hit the financial liquidity of small and medium sized enterprises under the single account scheme the central bank requires banks to consider only financial statements submitted to the revenue department when considering sme loans starting from jan 1 2019 but the requirement has raised concerns that it will lessen access to finance for most smes which tend to use more than one financial account and submit the one with the least value to understate or avoid tax while turning in another for loan applications the central bank will reportedly stick to its jan 1 deadline of requiring banks to use financial accounts submitted by smes to the revenue department for loan approval but it may offer a three year grace period for full compliance the bank of thailand on dec 19 raised the policy interest rate for the first time since 2011 by 25 basis points the central bank was among the last central banks in asia to join the rate hike bandwagon as high foreign reserves a current account surplus and subdued inflation allowed the rate to be kept below the us federal reserve s benchmark rate to support broad based economic growth the policy rate hit a record low of 1 25 in 2009 after the financial crisis of 2008 mr kalin expects active political campaigns for the long awaited general election with new and innovative policies declared by political parties most importantly the general election should be run on a transparent fair and peaceful basis while the policies announced by the political parties should come up with implementation processes and how to execute them he said chairman federation of thai industries mr supant said thailand s economic outlook is more muted because of the trade war between the us and china the trade war is keeping pressure on thailand while our economy will not grow as we expected he said meanwhile the extended brexit will affect the global economy as well the fti forecasts thai gdp in 2019 to grow by 4 4 3 as the country s export sector expands 5 7 the federation sees an inflation range of 0 8 1 2 this year we project that local purchasing power will become weaker than in 2018 due to low prices of farm products mr supant said he said all fragile factors will be obstacles to any future investment flows in many countries including thailand moreover the fti is concerned about the upcycle trend of interest rates in 2019 particularly the effect on small and medium sized enterprises smes because each 25 basis point hike will be on top of their existing financial costs smes lack the cash flow of large companies so the difference in interest rate is a more important factor for them the rate hike will attract foreign capital inflows he said meanwhile the fed s expected decision to increase rates in 2019 will lead to fluctuations in global currencies nonetheless the fti sees the country s tourism and export sectors boosting the domestic economy this year chinese tourists will be back to a normal situation after shrinking in the second half of 2018 mr supant said the sector still relies on tourists from china representing the largest group now in addition the planned general election in february will be a positive factor to increase overall investor confidence mr supant said the fti will closely monitor the election results and revise economic figures accordingly the flagship eec scheme will be implemented in 2019 after enactment of the 2018 eec act investment construction and infrastructure are projected to expand very well as business operators gain confidence to expand operations in the corridor mr supant said the eec is a key mechanism for thailand to overcome the middle income trap in the next 20 years chairwoman thai national shippers council although the us and china declared a 90 day halt to new tariffs in early december the trade war still needs watching in 2019 the new wrinkles of a chinese businesswoman arrested in canada and canadian businessmen detained in china have laid bare the risks to the global order these events may have a negative impact on thailand s export expansion opportunities ms ghanyapad said even though it is unforeseeable how long the trade war will be protracted it is expected that the global trade economy is unlikely to fall into a serious crisis she said to cross over this challenge thai exporters should alter their product lines to have an assortment of choices to meet consumers consumption trend and seek other replacement markets close monitoring and a continuous search for new channels to replace products that are able to fulfil the supply chain gap among the two giant countries are essential this is the strategy of changing the crisis situation into market expanding opportunities according to ms ghanyapad thai economic growth must brave myriad challenges and obstacles including the ongoing trade war volatile foreign exchange increasing trade barriers and political and financial troubles in importing countries although thailand is in the middle of the supply chain a trade war is unlikely to affect thai exports much she said there is only a small proportion of thai product items that appear in the list of us china tariff measures compared with total export items from thailand anyway business operators shall prepare for a flexible business plan especially for financial reserves and cash flow management to handle either a positive or negative situation that might occur in the future one more key issue is preventing products from being dumping from the us or china onto thailand s domestic market ms ghanyapad said the image of the completely democratic system of thailand will unlock trade conditions in some countries and make existing trade partners feel more comfortable she said these will encourage thai business operators to be more proactive in trade investor and consumer confidence in the political situation after the general election in thailand is the key factor as well as a number of world situations she said nonetheless against all odds the thai economy still has structural problems that need to be addressed such as the shortage of skilled labour the ageing society and an increase in many new laws that reduce the competitiveness of the private sector the world economy which is still fluctuating from trade wars may lead to sluggish trade these challenges are likely to affect overall companies capacity building
a declaration the other day by president muhammadu buhari after a meeting with the 36 state governors that the nigerian economy is in a bad shape though worrisome did not come to many as a surprise this newspaper did call attention recently to the deteriorating state of the economy in a number of editorials including ones on 2018 budget deficit and the debt service gains july 2 2018 truth about nigeria s economic growth july 9 2018 halt nigeria s rising debt profile august 27 2018 nigeria s uncertain economic outlook october 23 2018 among others it can also be recalled that at the last annual meetings of the international monetary fund imf world bank held in bali indonesia the growth prospect for africa was predicted to be sluggish for 2018 and 2019 it was also reported that contrary to an earlier imf world economic outlook report released in july 2018 that the nigerian economy was projected to grow by 2 1 per cent in 2018 this growth rate was downgraded to 1 9 per cent due to unfavourable developments in the economy it is largely surprising that the president could proclaim that under his watch for over three and half years the economy would be in such a very bad shape he even urged nigerian to still tighten their belts and prepare for tougher times ahead the question to ask nigeria s leader is why this is so in spite of all the promises made to the electorate as far back as 2014 while on the campaign trail on the glorious future that awaited the average nigerian in spite of little available resources it is quite instructive that these promises were made when the economy had started experiencing a downturn and oil prices had crashed to about 60 per barrel then the euphoria that greeted such promises made the nigerian public to give the then candidate of integrity capital a chance to turn the country into a paradise hence the former head of state became president and since then the many promises to the electorate have become a mirage of some sort the common excuse given by the administration for its non performance as generally expected which now appears to be a 2019 campaign slogan is the rot left behind by 16 years of misrule before 2015 it may be proper to interrogate this seemingly unfounded cliché of the administration within the 16 years of rot nigeria experienced an unprecedented debt relief that reduced public debt from about 36 billion to manageable levels among other positives that could be built upon though there were obvious gaps in economic governance in the delivery of public goods to the population as well as pervasive corruption over the 16 year period the problems of nigeria cannot be totally blamed on the happenings of that period at that meeting with the governors the president resorted to his pastime of blaming the current economic problems on the past 16 years this appears preposterous though the president had recently stated before this meeting with the governors that he would no longer focus on what happened in the past it appears he has no other alibi for the poor economic performance of his government in the past three and a half years even during the last vice presidential debate the vice president professor yemi osinbajo kept on hammering on 16 years of rot as if that is the major selling point of the administration for re election what really are the stylised facts on the current poor state of the nigerian economy first the country s balance of payments position entered into a deficit position to the tune of about 4 5 billion in the third quarter of 2018 from a surplus of 505 9 million in the previous quarter this is according to a recent report of the central bank of nigeria cbn in the same vein the current account balance which was in a surplus of 4 45 billion in the second quarter ran into a deficit 3 105 billion in the third quarter these figures clearly indicate increased payments for imports over the period relative to receipts from exports the cbn report also indicate that earnings from crude oil and gas account for a whopping 94 of total export earnings with non oil export receipts decreasing by almost 50 this calls to question the much celebrated diversification success story of the administration the surplus earlier recorded in net current transfers also decreased by 1 2 other results show that investment flow declined by 45 while portfolio investment inflows decreased significantly to a mere 1 79 billion in the third quarter from 4 23 billion the previous quarter these are worrisome second the latest national bureau of statistics nbs data indicate that inflation is now trending upwards rising to 11 28 year on year in november from 11 26 the previous month food inflation which affects the masses more directly also increased to 13 30 in november from 13 28 the previous month the urban inflation rate of 11 61 was recorded to be higher than the rural inflation figure of 10 99 as would be expected other indicators also reveal that over the past three and half years the economy of the sub national governments have been surviving on handouts from state budget support to bailout funds to paris club refunds to infrastructural development funds and so on the question to ask is whether this trend is sustainable in the running of the subnational governments in the country does this not suggest that as the americans would say we are kicking the can down the road or in other words postponing the doomsday does this not suggest that the country should give the concept of economic restructuring a chance the situation has not been helped by the downturn in the price of crude oil internationally with prices less than 60 per barrel while the 2019 budget bench mark for crude oil was set at 60 per barrel what is going on are we planning on a miracle happening in the international oil market even when qatar a prominent member of opec has given notice of its exit from the oil cartel added to this is the declaration by the director general dg of the budget office mr ben akabueze less than two weeks after the president s meeting with the governors that the level of independent revenue is now embarrassingly low with institutions such as the pppra cbn npa nimasa faan nipost and ncc among others being the major defaulters the federal government is thus going through serious financial challenges according to the chief executive of the budget office that the 2019 budget is threatened by revenue challenges is indeed worrisome the other worrisome issue is the unsustainable level of public debt which appears not to be matched by commensurate infrastructural development a situation where over 50 of revenues are used to service debts leaves very little for developmental purposes though the external reserves situation has improved from the 28 5 billion inherited from the past administration to about 42 92 billion it has been matched by increased external indebtedness which seemingly takes away the shine from that success story it is like a case of borrowing to increase reserves nigeria under the current administration needs to get its acts right the declaration of nigeria as the poverty capital of the world by the world economic forum and the poor state of human capital development are all manifestations of very poor economic policies over the past three and half years the world bank human capital index ranked nigeria as 152 out of 157 countries globally which is a very sad commentary on the posture of the government on developments in health and education sectors of the economy nigeria has been tagged the worst place to have a baby as well as the country with the highest out of school children globally if peoples belts are already tight in view of these stark realities one begins to wonder what it would look like if belts are further tightened with population projected to grow at almost 3 annually nigeria is set to become the third most populous country by 2050 if the current economic growth rate of less than 2 is not increased and adequate investments made in human capital nigeria is set to become an undernourished unhealthy and high unemployment rate country in the not too distant future a stitch in time saves nine what is the way forward the president himself in his address to the governors has inadvertently questioned his current economic policy framework he called on the governors to come together think and re think on the way forward aside from the need for an economic policy review government needs to come clean on its management of public resources what happened to the stamp duties collected since the inception of this administration what about the much widely publicised recovered loot what is being done with the low remittances by nnpc to the federation account which led to the stalling of the federal allocation accounts committee faac meetings earlier in the year what is being done about the humongous amounts being reportedly paid as subsidies for fuel these and many other questions are begging for answers in this new year which will usher in campaigns for leadership recruitment the country needs strategic thinking realistic development plans and concomitant sound management of the economy in this age of the big data nigeria needs leaders and managers who can promote measurable goals and discipline of execution

via consortiumnews the financial crisis of 2008 initially fostered a policy of bailing out banks with cheap money that went not into main street economies but into markets enriching the few as a result large numbers of people increasingly felt that they were being left behind and so turned against their leaders and sometimes each other as well as we head into 2019 a major question remains about the state of main street not just in the u s but across the planet if the global economy really is booming as many politicians claim why are leaders and their parties around the world continuing to get booted out of office in such a sweeping fashion one obvious answer the post great recession economic recovery was largely reserved for the few who could participate in the rising financial markets of those years not the majority who continued to work longer hours sometimes at multiple jobs to stay afloat in other words the good times have left out so many people like those struggling to keep even a few hundred dollars in their bank accounts to cover an emergency or the 80 percent of u s workers who live paycheck to paycheck in today s global economy financial security is increasingly the property of the 1 percent no surprise then that as a sense of economic instability continued to grow over the past decade angst turned to anger a transition that from the u s to the philippines hungary to brazil poland to mexico has provoked a plethora of voter upheavals in the process a 1930s style brew of rising nationalism and blaming the other whether that other was an immigrant a religious group a country or the rest of the world emerged this phenomenon offered a series of trumpian figures including of course the donald himself an opening to ride a wave of populism to the heights of the political system that the backgrounds and records of none of them whether you re talking about donald trump viktor orbán rodrigo duterte or jair bolsonaro among others reflected the daily concerns of the common people as the classic definition of populism might have it hardly mattered even a billionaire could it turned out exploit economic insecurity effectively and use it to rise to ultimate power ironically as that american master at evoking the fears of apprentices everywhere showed to assume the highest office in the land was only to begin a process of creating yet more fear and insecurity trump s trade wars for instance have typically infused the world with increased anxiety and distrust toward the u s even as they thwarted the ability of domestic business leaders and ordinary people to plan for the future meanwhile just under the surface of the reputed good times the damage to that future only intensified in other words the groundwork has already been laid for what could be a frightening transformation both domestically and globally that old financial crisis to understand how we got here let s take a step back only a decade ago the world experienced a genuine global financial crisis a meltdown of the first order economic growth ended shrinking economies threatened to collapse countless jobs were cut homes were foreclosed upon and lives wrecked for regular people access to credit suddenly disappeared no wonder fears rose no wonder for so many a brighter tomorrow ceased to exist the details of just why the great recession happened have since been glossed over by time and partisan spin this september when the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the global financial services firm lehman brothers came around major business news channels considered whether the world might be at risk of another such crisis however coverage of such fears like so many other topics was quickly tossed aside in favor of paying yet more attention to donald trump s latest tweets complaints insults and lies why because such a crisis was so 2008 in a year in which it was claimed we were enjoying a first class economic high and edging toward the longest bull market in wall street history when it came to boom versus gloom boom won hands down none of that changed one thing though most people still feel left behind both in the u s and globally thanks to the massive accumulation of wealth by a 1 percent skilled at gaming the system the roots of a crisis that didn t end with the end of the great recession have spread across the planet while the dividing line between the have nots and the have a lots only sharpened and widened though the media hasn t been paying much attention to the resulting inequality the statistics when you see them on that ever widening wealth gap are mind boggling according to inequality org for instance those with at least 30 million in wealth globally had the fastest growth rate of any group between 2016 and 2017 the size of that club rose by more than 25 percent during those years to 174 800 members or if you really want to grasp what s been happening consider that between 2009 and 2017 the number of billionaires whose combined wealth was greater than that of the world s poorest 50 percent fell from 380 to just eight and by the way despite claims by the president that every other country is screwing america the u s leads the pack when it comes to the growth of inequality as inequality org notes it has much greater shares of national wealth and income going to the richest 1 percent than any other country that in part is due to an institution many in the u s normally pay little attention to the u s central bank the federal reserve it helped spark that increase in wealth disparity domestically and globally by adopting a post crisis monetary policy in which electronically fabricated money via a program called quantitative easing was offered to banks and corporations at significantly cheaper rates than to ordinary americans pumped into financial markets that money sent stock prices soaring which naturally ballooned the wealth of the small percentage of the population that actually owned stocks according to economist stephen roach considering the fed s survey of consumer finances it is hardly a stretch to conclude that exacerbated america s already severe income disparities wall street central banks and everyday people what has since taken place around the world seems right out of the 1930s at that time as the world was emerging from the great depression a sense of broad economic security was slow to return instead fascism and other forms of nationalism gained steam as people turned on the usual cast of politicians on other countries and on each other if that sounds faintly trumpian to you it should we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in our post 2008 era people have witnessed trillions of dollars flowing into bank bailouts and other financial subsidies not just from governments but from the world s major central banks theoretically private banks as a result would have more money and pay less interest to get it they would then lend that money to main street businesses big and small would tap into those funds and in turn produce real economic growth through expansion hiring sprees and wage increases people would then have more dollars in their pockets and feeling more financially secure would spend that money driving the economy to new heights and all of course would then be well that fairy tale was pitched around the globe in fact cheap money also pushed debt to epic levels while the share prices of banks rose as did those of all sorts of other firms to record shattering heights even in the u s however where a magnificent recovery was supposed to have been in place for years actual economic growth simply didn t materialize at the levels promised at 2 percent per year the average growth of the american gross domestic product over the past decade for instance has been half the average of 4 percent before the 2008 crisis similar numbers were repeated throughout the developed world and most emerging markets in the meantime total global debt hit 247 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 as the institute of international finance found countries were on average borrowing about three dollars for every dollar of goods or services created global consequences what the fed along with central banks from europe to japan ignited in fact was a disproportionate rise in the stock and bond markets with the money they created that capital sought higher and faster returns than could be achieved in crucial infrastructure or social strengthening projects like building roads high speed railways hospitals or schools what followed was anything but fair as former federal reserve chair janet yellen noted four years ago it is no secret that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority and of course continuing to pour money into the highest levels of the private banking system was anything but a formula for walking that back instead as more citizens fell behind a sense of disenfranchisement and bitterness with existing governments only grew in the u s that meant donald trump in the united kingdom similar discontent was reflected in the june 2016 brexit vote to leave the european union which those who felt economically squeezed to death clearly meant as a slap at both the establishment domestically and eu leaders abroad since then multiple governments in the european union too have shifted toward the populist right in germany recent elections swung both right and left just six years after in july 2012 european central bank head mario draghi exuded optimism over the ability of such banks to protect the financial system the euro and generally hold things together like the fed in the u s the ecb went on to manufacture money adding another 3 trillion to its books that would be deployed to buy bonds from favored countries and companies that artificial stimulus too only increased inequality within and between countries in europe meanwhile brexit negotiations remain ruinously divisive threatening to rip great britain apart nor was such a story the captive of the north atlantic in brazil where left wing president dilma rouseff was ousted from power in 2016 her successor michel temer oversaw plummeting economic growth and escalating unemployment that in turn led to the election of that country s own donald trump nationalistic far right candidate jair bolsonaro who won a striking 55 2 percent of the vote against a backdrop of popular discontent in true trumpian style he is disposed against both the very idea of climate change and multilateral trade agreements in mexico dissatisfied voters similarly rejected the political known but by swinging left for the first time in 70 years new president andrés manuel lópez obrador popularly known by his initials amlo promised to put the needs of ordinary mexicans first however he has the u s and the whims of donald trump and his great wall to contend with which could hamper those efforts as amlo took office on dec 1 the g20 summit of world leaders was unfolding in argentina there amid a glittering backdrop of power and influence the trade war between the u s and the world s rising superpower china came even more clearly into focus while its president xi jinping having fully consolidated power amid a wave of chinese nationalism could become his country s longest serving leader he faces an international landscape that would have amazed and befuddled mao zedong though trump declared his meeting with xi a success because the two sides agreed on a 90 day tariff truce his prompt appointment of an anti chinese hardliner robert lighthizer to head negotiations a tweet in which he referred to himself in superhero fashion as a tariff man and news that the u s had requested that canada arrest and extradite an executive of a key chinese tech company caused the dow to take its fourth largest plunge in history and then fluctuate wildly as economic fears of a future great something rose more uncertainty and distrust were the true product of that meeting in fact we are now in a world whose key leaders especially the president of the united states remain willfully oblivious to its long term problems putting policies like deregulation fake nationalist solutions and profits for the already grotesquely wealthy ahead of the future lives of the mass of citizens consider the yellow vest protests that have broken out in france where protestors identifying with left and right political parties are calling for the resignation of neoliberal french president emmanuel macron many of them from financially starved provincial towns are angry that their purchasing power has dropped so low they can barely make ends meet ultimately what transcends geography and geopolitics is an underlying level of economic discontent sparked by twenty first century economics and a resulting grand canyon sized global inequality gap that is still widening whether the protests go left or right what continues to lie at the heart of the matter is the way failed policies and stop gap measures put in place around the world are no longer working not when it comes to the non 1 percent anyway people from washington to paris london to beijing increasingly grasp that their economic circumstances are not getting better and are not likely to in any presently imaginable future given those now in power a dangerous recipe the financial crisis of 2008 initially fostered a policy of bailing out banks with cheap money that went not into main street economies but into markets enriching the few as a result large numbers of people increasingly felt that they were being left behind and so turned against their leaders and sometimes each other as well this situation was then exploited by a set of self appointed politicians of the people including a billionaire tv personality who capitalized on an increasingly widespread fear of a future at risk their promises of economic prosperity were wrapped in populist platitudes normally but not always of a right wing sort lost in this shift away from previously dominant political parties and the systems that went with them was a true form of populism which would genuinely put the needs of the majority of people over the elite few build real things including infrastructure foster organic wealth distribution and stabilize economies above financial markets in the meantime what we have is of course a recipe for an increasingly unstable and vicious world nomi prins is a tomdispatch regular her latest book is collusion how central bankers rigged the world nation books of her six other books the most

volatility returned to the currency markets in 2018 the prior year did not provide investors with fear and uncertainty the way 2018 did the dollar was the main catalyst for changes in market sentiment exchange rates were relatively stable until the spring of 2018 and then it became clear that us yields would rise sending the greenback higher there were also some severe movements in emerging currencies the chinese yuan weakened substantially along with the turkish lira moving forward there are several factors investors should focus on the ecb will play a key role in 2018 along with political events in both the uk and us the strength in the greenback the dollar returned as the king of the currencies in the spring of 2018 a new federal reserve chair began his tenure and quickly installed the belief that the fed would continue to raise rates multiple times in 2018 and 2019 this led to a rise in us yields pushing the yield differential between major counterparts in favor of the greenback advertisement advertisement fed chair powell s continued to be hawkish throughout the year and by october of 2018 the average fed forecast confirmed the central banks intention to increase interest rates three more times in 2019 with another rate hike scheduled for december fed chair powell in the fall of 2018 said that monetary policy was still accommodative and there was further to go before the fed funds rate hit neutrality the hawkish tone of the fed was repeated during the week before christmas the fed increased the fed fund rates by 25 basis points and signaled some softening by forecasting an increase in interest rates by 50 basis points in 2019 instead of the 75 basis point forecast increase they had made during the fall this was at odds with the market which forecast rates to fall in 2019 the dollar versus the euro which is the most liquid global currency pair has a peak to trough move of nearly 10 the increase in the value of the greenback might be curtailed by a less hawkish fed the markets are signaling that rates have reached restrictive levels which might reduce dollar volatility moving forward eur usd 1y advertisement advertisement one of the issues is the concept of neutrality coming out of the great financial crisis the fed wanted to increase interest rates to the point where they had enough bullets to reduce rates should a recession occur if the fed left rates as very accommodative levels then there would be no stimulus to help the economy if it began to falter story continues the fed also needed to unwind its asset purchases the period of quantitative easing had ended and the fed began to wind down its portfolio this strategy was put in place before president trump was elected and there has been continuity between recent fed chairs during the last 10 years the president has been ultra critical of the fed decision to increase rates during 2018 if this occurred in nearly any other country investors would have hammered the currency yields would soar as investors extract a steep price for criticism of the central bank brexit hampers sterling gbp usd 1y the pound was a big loser in 2018 as the issue related to brexit started to heat up the decline in the pound coincided with strength in the greenback which began in the spring of 2018 the gbp usd had peaked to trough range of 13 advertisement advertisement during the fall of 2018 reports that the eu and the uk were having difficulty reaching an agreement started to generate headwinds for the gbp despite mixed data some of which showed strength the bank of england was hamstrung by the brexit issues ahead of the christmas break prime minister terresa may reached an agreement with the ec but was told this would be the last agreement and there was no flexibility unfortunately pm may was unable to get the brexit bill passed by the parliament in fact her own party the tories held a no confidence vote which may was able to survive this will be revisited in early 2019 as the brexit saga continues the chinese yuan tumbles the chinese yuan was one of the biggest movers during 2018 the peak to trough range was nearly 11 5 the currency began to weaken during the spring of 2018 as trade issue between the us and china began to heat up there were multiple fits and starts and as of the year end the rhetoric between president trump and president xi continues initially investors thought the weakening of the chinese currency was a function of the people s bank of china s efforts to offset softening exports with a weaker currency this would make chinese exports more attractive during the latter half of 2018 chinese economic data began to soften which was foreshadowed by the weakening currency as of year end chinese pmi data moved into contraction territory which points to further contraction in the chinese economy usd cny 1y 2019 forecast while 2018 was the year of the dollar there are many issues that can change the narrative in 2019 the fed will likely change its tune and reduce the number of rate hikes to 1 instead of 2 us yields already reflect this scenario and should help reduce the value of the dollar the global economy could continue to weaken which will weigh on the yuan and could further hurt the chinese currency advertisement advertisement the markets have also failed to discount the volatility associated with political unrest in the united states president trump could be impeached which is likely but nobody believes the senate will convict him if this becomes the case the markets could become very volatile and could generate significantly headwinds for the dollar us yields in this case would decline instead of rising making the dollar less attractive at the same time investors would be looking for a safe haven currency which would likely be the yen and the swiss franc even if political unrest does not occur a potential recession in the us would weigh on the greenback this article was originally

cameroon 01 01 2019 listen photo ambacoin youtube cameroonian separatists fighting for the independence of the self declared state of ambazonia have put their own cryptocurrency on sale to the general public the ambacoin aims to provide humanitarian relief to those affected by the conflict in the anglophone regions with the hope of raising up to 250 million us dollars the initiative is geared towards helping with humanitarian side of things says frank one of the members of the ambacoin project who responded to press enquiries about the cryptocurrency but wanted to remain anonymous that s the idea behind it to raise funds to support humanitarian efforts it is hoped that the creation of a currency for so called ambazonia will also support efforts to have the breakaway state officially recognised as a country creating their own ambazonian currency enables the separatists to move away from using the cfa franc the idea of ambacoin was to get away from the cfa we don t see the cfa franc as a legitimate currency for ambazonia says frank if we want to be independent we can t pursue a french colonial currency cameroon s currency is issued by the bank of the central african states which is in turn backed by the french government s treasury the cfa franc is pegged to the euro however and it has drawn the ire of activists in west and central african countries in recent years who have protested france s continuing influence long after the end of colonialism how does it work ambacoin officially went on sale on 28 december with one ambacoin token equivalent to 25 us cents before the main crowdsale the token was offered through a presale with 10 percent of the ambacoins available more than 30 000 ambacoins had been issued as of 1 january according to the website there are 13 holders of ambacoin according to an analysis available on the bloxy website which provides information on public blockchains one digital wallet address holds almost 42 per cent of the existing ambacoins issued supporters of ambazonia can purchase ambacoins through a dashboard on the website users can use other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin litecoin or dash to make transactions as well as traditional currencies including euros dollars cfa francs rand or rubles the ambacoins then reside in an ethereum digital wallet the project describes the token being compatible with several existing cryptocurrency digital wallets the token itself is built upon existing ethereum blockchain technology providing a decentralised public ledger ambacoin s whitepaper describes how transactions are completed using ethereum s system of smart contracts a protocol aiming to enforce transactions without a third party ambacoin is based on the proof of stake architecture defining how block transactions are dealt with this approach avoids the need for mining where computing power is used to run different cryptographic calculations how can ambacoin be used the project envisages a number of uses for ambacoin the whitepaper describes how supporters can hold onto the token and watch its value appreciate over time a strategy popularised by bitcoin enthusiasts where to hodl is to hold onto cryptocurrency rather than sell it furthermore ambacoin can be traded to provide a return for investors according to the project it also acts as a digitised form of a treasury bill eventually the ambazonian nation will purchase it and it can be used to get access to national services according to the whitepaper the ambacoin will not be pegged to any particular traditional currency and it aims to become particularly important for remittances from africans in the diaspora spending on potential humanitarian relief for the anglophone regions will be decided by ambacoin s board of directors according to frank they will make that decision he says drawing particular attention to the plight of refugees and internally displaced people who have been hit by the worsening violence in cameroon s anglophone regions the crisis that hit the north west and south west regions has already seen humanitarian fundraising efforts the cameroonian government in mid 2018 raised almost 20 million euros to help people hit by the fallout of what it says are acts of terrorism carried out by separatist groups support from ambazonian government a number of different groups purporting to be the government of ambazonia have emerged since the self declaration of independence for ambazonia in october 2017 the situation on the ground has also evolved with rival separatist armed groups involved in fighting between themselves as well as with the cameroonian security forces it s an initiative of a few individuals chris anu a spokesperson for the federal republic of ambazonia told rfi in response to questions about ambacoin our government has not endorsed it the rival ambazonia governing council says it fully endorses ambacoin and encourages its supporters to buy the cryptocurrency describing it as an ingenious and revolutionary initiative a group of creative geniuses developed a cryptocurrency designed to foster the ambazonian revolution to establish a separate homeland and foster a unique sense of national ownership of our medium of exchange says cho ayaba head of the agc in emailed comments who is behind it those behind ambacoin are not immediately known the project s whitepaper says

of ambazonia is not the only self declared territory to issue its own currency somaliland which declared independence after the fall of military leader siad barre in 1991 issues the somaliland shilling and operates its own central bank south sudan took a different route to issuing its own currency waiting until it achieved independence before introducing the south sudanese pound the country split from sudan in 2011 and remains the african continent s youngest country other countries outside of the african continent have been involved in cryptocurrency initiatives venezuela s government launched the petro in early 2018 with president nicolas maduro describing it as the cornerstone of efforts to rebuild the country the petro is said to be backed by oil reserves but investigations have revealed scant details on the cryptocurrency the marshall islands is also reportedly launching a cryptocurrency in partnership with an israeli firm however the international monetary fund in a september 2018 report says that there are many risks involved in issuing a cryptocurrency as legal tender supporters of ambazonia such as frank see little downside in issuing ambacoins for the breakaway state we believe the closer ambazonia gets to being an independent nation it will affect the value of the coin he says people are getting to know cryptocurrency the more it gets known the more stable it becomes says frank the future is what matters

billion and 1 03 billion respectively the cbn s intervention in the month of may was estimated at about 1 06 billion june 1 29 billion while july had 970 million among others before i e forex window before the introduction of the forex window the local equities market and the foreign exchange forex market were in shambles the all share index alsi was continuously shrinking and the naira weakened against other currencies especially the dollar the i e window has become the attraction making many of the business concerns to take another look at their exit from the country the introduction of the window was followed by continuous interventions by the cbn which enabled banks and bdc operators to meet forex demand at the retail end of the market thus the window has become a life saving pill for the domestic economy as it has attracted about 60 billion into the market enhanced transparency and made forex available to the end users the operations of companies especially manufacturing has been on the upward swing with an improvement in inflation figures as well as equities market performance according to the cbn director in charge of financial markets alvan ikoku the investors exporters fx window is boosting liquidity in the forex market and ensuring timely execution and settlement for eligible transactions by all parties before the stability in the forex market and naira the economy witnessed a depressed gross domestic product gdp growth which culminated in a recession in 2016 there was also rising inflation which peaked at almost 19 per cent in january 2017 and a persistently rising unemployment rate to 14 23 per cent in 2016 fourth quarter from 6 41 per cent as at 2014 fourth quarter there was also a significant depreciation of the exchange rate reaching n525 to 1 in february 2017 and witnessed a fast depletion of the reserves which was drained down from about 23 6 billion in october 2016 from as high as 40 billion in january 2014 the i e forex window seen as a willing buyer willing seller window allows foreign investors to bring in dollars into the economy at any price of their choice provided they could find buyers at such rate the figure at the window has also impacted positively on the purchasing managers index pmi a lagos based economist and managing director financial derivatives company limited bismarck rewane described the introduction of the i e forex window as the best policy implemented by the cbn speaking on the issue cbn s director corporate communications isaac okorafor reiterated the bank s commitment to ensure adequate forex supply to genuine customers to achieve the goal of forex rates convergence managing director afrinvest west africa plc ike chioke said the window has won the confidence of foreign investors he said the window attracted foreign investors appetite for nigerian assets leading to impressive appreciation in the equities market and stabilising the naira before the introduction of the window foreign investors appetite for local assets waned significantly on the back of currency crisis which in turn fundamentally weakened macroeconomic performance dragged corporate earnings and also impacted on equities market viability according to the cbn spokesman forex supply to the window shall be through portfolio investors exporters authorised dealers and other parties with foreign currency to exchange to naira the apex bank is a market participant at the window to promote liquidity and professional market conduct he said that the apex bank assured that the exchange rates of the transactions would be as agreed between authorised dealers and their counterparties besides he said the regulator reserved the right to intervene as a buyer or seller as it deems fit in the window even as information on transactions between authorised dealers is reported to the cbn on a daily basis manufacturers and other foreign exchange forex end users also seem to be having a great time over the coming of the window barely a month after trading at the window commenced operation international credit rating agency fitch ratings released a report stating that the establishment of the i e forex window had led to an improvement in banks forex liquidity situation the naira has been stable at the official and parallel markets with the foreign exchange forex reserves standing at 47 6 billion a report by exotic capital an investment and research firm has said the report said although the level of reserves was still below the record high of 64 billion realised in august 2008 it has nearly doubled the 24 billion recorded in october 2016 increasing by more than 22 billion in 17 months we have written extensively on nigeria s multiple exchange rate system and will abstain from further discussion at present suffice to say that a fairly valued naira at 360 to the dollar combined with high domestic rates has led to a tremendous increase in the level of gross foreign reserves held at the cbn the report said a similar report by fbn capital entitled towards the 50 billion threshold and counting said the rapid accumulation of 15 96 billion over 12 months was due to two sizeable eurobond launches a small diaspora bond issue the recovery in oil export revenues through the nigeria national petroleum corporation s share of production and more recently the steady bid by the cbn at the i e forex window the fbn capital report said we should stress that the data are gross and mask the swap transactions the cbn has entered into with local banks the steady bid by the cbn has been seen variously as a response to the softening of demand for forex by importers and other economic actors and as a move to contain naira appreciation currency control measures the cbn has imposed some currency control measures to save the naira in june 2016 it curbed access to the interbank currency market for importers bringing in a variety of goods in an effort to conserve its dollar reserves the bank said importers could no longer get hard currency to buy 41 items ranging from toothpicks and rice to steel products and private jets other measures it took include the first naira settled over the counter otc forex futures market ffm launched with fmdq otc securities exchange and the planned resumption of dollar sales to the bdcs the fmdq otc securities exchange fmdq is an organisation with the strategic intent of bringing about revolutionary changes and fostering the development of the financial markets the naira settled otc forex futures are non deliverable forwards or a contract where parties agree to an exchange rate for a pre determined date in the future without the obligation to deliver the underlying dollar on the maturity settlement date on the maturity date it will be assumed that both parties would have transacted at the spot forex market rate the party that would have suffered a loss with the spot forex rate will be paid a settlement amount in naira to ensure that both parties enjoy the rate that had been guaranteed to each other through the otc forex futures

investors are looking for clues about what 2019 will bring the hope on wall street is that the underlying economy of the united states is sound that the recent selling will burn itself out and that stocks will resume their record setting climb but the risk is that the plunge the worst annual decline in a decade could be the start of something more sinister the forces that pushed the s p 500 down 6 2 percent in 2018 are still in place the economy is still doing well but it does not appear to be as strong as it once was president trump is lashing out at the federal reserve and the central bank s interest rate increases pose a risk to corporate profits and investors appetite for stocks america s trade war with china continues and the technology giants that dominate the stock market face heightened scrutiny about their business practices as investors try to gauge the seriousness of these risks stocks could lurch in different directions at each new event a meeting of the fed later this month an earnings report in february or a trade negotiation deadline in march could all prove to be catalysts for a big rise or fall but wall street s top stock pickers are still expecting gains this year even if they re not quite as boisterous in their predictions as they once were it could get more frightening before it gets better said james paulsen chief investment strategist at the research firm leuthold group but i think we survive for another run last year was a reminder of how unpredictable stock markets can be in january with corporate tax cuts in place the outlook for the market in the united states was great and stocks did hit a record high in september with apple and amazon becoming the first publicly traded american companies to be valued at more than 1 trillion but 2018 was also turbulent with markets falling sharply in february and again at the end of the year the s p 500 narrowly avoided one grim milestone a 20 percent drop from its high a decline that would signal the start of a bear market the index ended 2018 down 14 5 percent from its high point and a bear market could yet be in store should stocks experience another decline similar to what they went through in early december if that happens the pessimism that has hovered over the stock market could leach into the rest of the economy as companies grow wary of taking risks expanding or adding more workers

and expectations about where those rates are headed may have weighed on stock prices more than anything else in 2018 with the united states s economy humming the fed increased its target rate four times in 2018 pushing up borrowing costs across the economy the yield on the 10 year treasury note which is the basis for debt like home mortgages and corporate loans climbed to its highest level since 2011 before falling back when borrowing costs rise too much they can be restrictive companies and consumers pull back and the economy suffers in the worst case a recession could occur stocks tumbled as investors became increasingly concerned that the fed under a new chairman jerome h powell would raise interest rates too far and send a chill through the american economy only more data on the state of the economy will ease the concerns about growth if investors see the economy growing steadily jitters over the fed s intentions and the recession fears that gripped stocks could fade we re going to see if the market was wildly hysterical about a recession said ed yardeni chief investment strategist at yardeni research if not then investors could hang on the fed s every move and monetary policy meeting in 2019 president trump is a factor heading into 2018 in the days after mr trump s tax cuts were enacted investors were mostly buoyant about his presidency and tolerant of his unpredictable declarations on twitter that bullishness persisted even after it became clear that mr trump was serious about imposing restrictions on trading partners as a way of gaining concessions from them but as the trade war continued unresolved tensions with china started to become a concern and mr trump s proclamations started to make investors jumpy when mr trump referred to himself on twitter as tariff man the message helped spur a drop of more than 3 percent in the s p 500 i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in billions in tariffs make america rich again donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 4 2018 it wasn t just the tweets about china that began to bother investors mr trump also roiled the markets with criticism of the fed which he blamed for the stock market turmoil this is a change for the market when the investment bank rbc capital markets surveyed big investors in december about what kept them up at night mr trump topped the list interest rates and the trade war ranked second and third the only problem our economy has is the fed they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 24 2018 when it comes to mr trump investors have a lot to consider they

showed signs of slowing down late in 2018 and reliable indicators of global growth like the price of oil and copper are flashing warnings growth may accelerate if trade agreements are forged in 2019 but the problems could be deeper china s methods for pulling its economy out of a rut probably are not as effective as they once were and the battle between italy s populist government and the european union over the country s spending plans may heat up again the european economy could also be hit hard if britain crashes out of the european union without an agreement that keeps trade flowing freely that could be avoided if parliament approves a withdrawal deal prime minister theresa may has struck with the union but that is no sure thing mrs may lacking the necessary support was forced to delay a vote originally set for last month until mid january she has been trying so far unsuccessfully to extract changes from european officials in hopes of improving the chances of passage when that vote comes if parliament ultimately rejects mrs may s proposal investors will probably remain nervous and support may grow among lawmakers for a second referendum on whether britain should

push key stock benchmarks like the s p 500 and nasdaq composite to records and then dragged those indexes down when the companies went into free fall the tech giants shares plunged in part because they were deemed to be too expensive put another way investors went from being optimistic that the companies future earnings would be terrific to worried that they wouldn t some of the large tech firms also face substantial problems in their own operations that could take time to resolve apple for example counts on china as both a market where it sells iphones and a manufacturing hub facebook is spending large sums of money to try to protect its network from interference any sign that its systems have been abused with the goal of swinging an election could subject it to regulation facebook is not alone in facing this concern some analysts say that large tech companies are now in a position to similar to what big banks confronted after the financial crisis of 2008 the tech companies are a heck of a lot better run than the financial companies were in 2007 said savita subramanian equity strategist at bank of america merrill lynch but their incentives may not be aligned with the best interests of employees and shareholders quite a few things have to go right for stocks to recover in 2019 the united states economy has to grow at a strong enough pace to deliver the corporate earnings that investors are hoping for but if the economy grows quickly investors may return to worrying about higher interest rates if the fed can tread a delicate middle ground the trade war winds down and the economies of europe and china stabilize a recovery in stock prices could hold
wall street started 2018 strong buoyed by a growing economy and corporate profits it didn t end that way u s stocks climbed to new highs in january shook off a sudden steep drop by spring and rode a wave of tax cut juiced corporate earnings growth to another all time high by september then the jitters set in investors grew worried that the testy u s china trade dispute and higher interest rates would slow the economy hurting corporate profits a slowing u s housing market and forecasts of weaker global growth in 2019 stoked traders unease in october the market entered a volatile skid as traders sold technology companies and other growth sectors in favor of less risky assets such as government bonds the autumn sell off knocked the benchmark s p 500 index into a correction or a drop of 10 percent from its all time high the index ended with its worst annual performance in a decade losing 6 2 percent viva volatility the stock market s gyrations grew more volatile in 2018 as investors faced uncertainty over trade and rising interest rates the benchmark s p 500 index slid into a correction or a drop of 10 percent from its high twice this year bond yields surged as investors sought less risky investments though gold weakened after rallying early in the year everything struggled diversify is one of the bedrock tenets of investing and it s supposed to shine brightest when markets are turbulent the hope is that if u s stocks are struggling markets in other areas of the world will be doing better or bonds or gold this year though nearly everything has been a loser economic headwinds the pace of global economic growth will slow next year the organization for economic cooperation and development said recently trade growth and investment have been slackening on the back of tariff hikes the paris based economic think tank says it warns world economic activity could be weaker in the years ahead if the u s and china impose further penalties on each other s goods trade tremors president donald trump said early this year that trade wars are good and easy to win but worries about the effect of tariffs on international trade and corporate profits have weighed on stocks boeing s stock became a proxy of sorts for investors as worries about trade waxed and waned boeing got more than half its revenue from abroad in the last year including about 12 percent from china according to factset profit power corporate america s earnings growth surged in 2018 driven by lower tax bills and a growing economy the strong results helped to briefly spur the stock market to new highs more recently investors have grown concerned that 2018 may be the peak for corporate profit growth especially given recent signs that the global economy is slowing that s one reason analysts are forecasting more modest earnings growth next year do you subscribe facebook and alphabet google s parent company were longtime market favorites until mid 2018 facebook faced controversies related to user privacy and concerns its services enabled election meddling and contributed to violence overseas analysts projected a slowdown in user growth investors also began to wonder if facebook google snap and other tech companies will face new regulations twitter fared better after several rough years oil slick falling oil prices used to be welcome news in the u s but that was before the oil boom of the last decade a drop in oil can still mean lower gas prices for drivers but this year s 40 percent plunge from a four year peak of about 76 a barrel in october is unequivocally bad news for the oil companies that have helped domestic production roughly double over the past seven years not home the u s housing market stalled in 2018 as years of prices climbing faster than incomes coupled with a steady rise in mortgage rates took their toll the higher borrowing costs and prices have put homeownership out of reach for many would be buyers sales of existing homes posted their biggest annual drop in four years in october economists are forecasting further weakness in housing next year and higher mortgage rates big and small smaller stocks surged this spring as trade tensions dominated the headlines investors believed those companies which do less business overseas compared to larger companies would feel less pain during a prolonged trade dispute but smaller companies are also weaker financially and are more likely to struggle when the u s economy slows and wall street grew very worried about that possibility later in the year that caused huge losses high and low times a majority of u s states have legalized marijuana to varying degrees and companies are scrambling to get in on the action both the nyse and nasdaq saw their first purely cannabis companies list shares in 2018 but stocks in the companies that produce and sell marijuana have largely underperformed the overall market this year __ markets team members greg keller stan choe marley jay and seth sutel contributed to this report
an impasse over the federal budget reaches a stalemate the president and congress both refuse to back down triggering a near total government shutdown the president declares emergency powers congress rescinds his authority dollar and bond prices plummet the president threatens to stop social security checks congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling default looms wall street panics the fourth turning strauss howe strauss and howe wrote their book in 1996 they were not trying to be prophets of doom but observers of history able to connect events through human life cycles of 80 or so years using critical thinking skills and identifying the most likely triggers for crisis debt civic decay and global disorder they were able to anticipate scenarios which could drive the next crisis which they warned would arrive in the mid 2000 decade the scenario described above is fairly close to the current situation driven by the showdown between trump and the democrats regarding the border wall it has not reached the stage where all hell breaks loose but if it extends until the end of january and food stamp money is not distributed to 40 million people mostly in urban ghettos all bets are off the likelihood of this scenario is small but there are numerous potential triggers which could still make 2019 go down in history as a year to remember as we enter the eleventh year of this fourth turning the fourth crisis period in u s history the mood of u s citizens and citizens around the globe continues to darken fourth turnings are driven by generational configuration and the emotional reaction to events by the prophet generation leaders nomad generation spearheads and hero generation cannon fodder as we close out this year stock markets are gyrating wildly central bankers are trying to reverse their nine years of interventionist strategies to sustain the establishment civil chaos spreads across the european continent saber rattling between the u s russia and china increases the animosity between political parties reaches new heights the deep state relentlessly pursues their mueller led coup against trump mega social media corporations tighten their grip on free speech by silencing conservatives leftists push their socialist open borders normalizing degeneracy agenda and global recession gains momentum as trade declines and global debt reaches unserviceable levels examining the three prior fourth turnings may give us a window into where we stand and what may happen in the coming year we are in the tenth year of this crisis with the eleven year anniversary slated for september 2019 the american revolution crisis was catalyzed in 1773 when the boston tea party forever changed the colonial mood towards revolution after eight years of struggle and desperate measures the climax was reached with the surrender of cornwallis at yorktown in 1781 but there was still thirteen more years of crisis as the new states forged a constitution elected washington its first president and he withstood the jacobins put down the whiskey rebellion and finalized a treaty with england in year ten of the crisis two years past the climax the treaty of paris was signed british troops left the continent and washington resigned as commander of american troops the articles of confederation had been ratified in 1781 and remained in place until succeeded by the u s constitution in 1789 there was no tenth or eleventh year of the civil war crisis lincoln s election with only 40 of the popular vote prompting the attack on fort sumpter and subsequent secession of southern states triggered the bloodiest conflict in world history with 8 of all white men aged 13 to 43 killed in the war including 6 in the north and 18 in the south the acceleration of this fourth turning into a five year window from 1860 to 1865 was not a positive development the extreme intensity of the conflict resulted in 700 000 tragic deaths the catalyst occurred five years too soon and the resolution a generation too soon a more extended crisis may have allowed tempers to moderate and the conflict to end in a more constructive manner instead with the surrender at appomattox and assassination of lincoln the resolution felt more like a defeat than a victory turmoil continued for at least a decade after the resolution the great depression world war ii crisis saw its tenth and eleventh years as the most ominous dangerous and destructive for great britain as they bore the brunt of the german onslaught 1939 saw the nazi invasion of poland and the official start of world war ii in may of 1940 germany launched its blitzkrieg offensive through holland and belgium defeating the french and british forces in a matter of weeks chamberlain resigned as prime minister replaced by churchill as france surrendered in late june the battle of britain raged from july through october as hitler relentlessly bombed england trying to force their surrender germany italy and japan signed the tripartite pact in september setting the stage for the u s eventual participation in the war einstein informed fdr of the potential for an atomic bomb during 1939 and the manhattan project was born the climax of the crisis occurred with the successful d day invasion the dropping of two atomic bombs on japan and successful demobilization of military forces marked the end of the crisis history may not repeat but human nature never changes so the 80 year cycles of manmade crisis will repeat the length of time from the american revolution climax in 1781 until the civil war climax in 1863 was 82 years the next climax in 1944 was 81 years after the civil war climax therefore we can expect a climax to this current crisis sometime in the 2025 range the question is what events will transpire between 2019 and 2025 before a climax is reached based upon history the resolution will not be based on compromise civility reason or peaceful means the combustible combination of unpayable debt civic anarchy and global chaos are set to detonate creating an era of maximum darkness death destruction and decisions making america great again will require personal sacrifice dreadful choices survival skills intelligent decisions and the courage to win at all costs the first ten years of this crisis were the early winter solstice period when public order began to pass its nadir the coldest days of winter beckon with the harshest years of the crisis ahead many melancholy days lie ahead as bitter winter winds and blizzard like conditions sweep the bleak landscape testing the mettle of even the bravest souls the catalyst for the crisis was the wall street created global financial meltdown in 2008 the election of trump marked the beginning of the regeneracy with trump as the gray champion the last two years have certainly marked a new more volatile phase of this crisis setting the stage for the fireworks to come the regeneracy is less like fdr s new deal initiated unification of the country and more like the lincoln regeneracy after the first battle of bull run when he ordered the enlistment of a half million men to fight a like number of fellow american men both american factions were unified in their cause the chain reaction of emergencies and unyielding responses will continue unabated until a final resolution is achieved in retrospect the spark might seem as ominous as a financial crash as ordinary as a national election or as trivial as a tea party the catalyst will unfold according to a basic crisis dynamic that underlies all of these scenarios an initial spark will trigger a chain reaction of unyielding responses and further emergencies the core elements of these scenarios debt civic decay global disorder will matter more than the details which the catalyst will juxtapose and connect in some unknowable way if foreign societies are also entering a fourth turning this could accelerate the chain reaction at home and abroad these events will reflect the tearing of the civic fabric at points of extreme vulnerability problem areas where america will have neglected denied or delayed needed action the fourth turning strauss howe strauss and howe foresaw the core elements which would surely propel the next fourth turning they were plain to see for people who chose to see the world with eyes wide open debt civic decay and global disorder are on center stage as we enter the fateful year of 2019 a madness seems to be gripping the nation a melancholy realization all is not right everything has a chaotic feel as financial markets are falling politicians threaten and attack each other government dysfunction is laid bare for all to see deep state snakes slither behind the scenes trying to bring down trump racial tensions grow foreign governments topple russia and china challenge u s hegemony and the global debt ponzi scheme is entering its collapse phase there are no moderates only pro trump and anti trump factions compromise and workable solutions to our deep seated problems are off the table the mood of the populace ranges from frustrated and angry to depressed and stressed the aroma of conflict wafts through the air as battle lines are being drawn the initial spark of a global financial meltdown created by greedy wall street banks the feckless fed and corrupt government officials was driven by bad debt outright control fraud by the financial industry captured rating agencies easy money provided by the wall street owned fed and utter contempt for properly regulating the wall street cabal by the fed and sec this emergency was met by an unyielding response from the establishment with the easiest money policies in world history bailing out criminal bankers with taxpayer funds increasing global debt by 80 trillion to 250 trillion 318 of global gdp running fiscal deficits exceeding 1 trillion per year and pretending all that debt will be repaid pretend and extend has been the solution the deep state has taken extraordinary measures to try and retain their stranglehold on the wealth of the nation and control of the political financial social and media levers of society they have utilized a combination of propaganda disguised as news social media distractions technological surveillance misinformation campaigns welfare to keep the poor sedated and the continued issuance of debt to keep the masses satiated with consumer goods as their wealth dissipates but the teetering edifice of debt delusion and deception is poised to topple in 2019 as we enter 2019 year eleven of this ongoing crisis you can sense the panic and distress permeating from the pores of the establishment figures and their rich shadowy benefactors trying to maintain their unseen presence behind the curtain as they pull the strings operating as the invisible government running the show for their own benefit it seems the unanticipated election of trump has thrown a monkey wrench into their well oiled pillage machine forcing them to reveal themselves as they attempt a not so subtle coup against a sitting president fourth turnings always sweep away the existing social order in a torrent of violent upheaval and the blood of young men but that doesn t mean the existing establishment will give up their wealth power and control without a fight and the fight is underway the volcano has erupted and the molten lava could flow in numerous pathways over the next six or so years imagine some national and probably global volcanic eruption initially flowing along channels of distress that were created during the unraveling era and further widened by the catalyst trying to foresee where the eruption will go once it bursts free of the channels is like trying to predict the exact fault line of an earthquake all you know in advance is something about the molten ingredients of the climax which could include the following economic distress with public debt in default entitlement trust funds in bankruptcy mounting poverty and unemployment trade wars collapsing financial markets and hyperinflation or deflation social distress with violence fueled by class race nativism or religion and abetted by armed gangs underground militias and mercenaries hired by walled communities political distress with institutional collapse open tax revolts one party hegemony major constitutional change secessionism authoritarianism and altered national borders military distress with war against terrorists or foreign regimes equipped with weapons of mass destruction the fourth turning strauss howe the ingredients of distress in the next phase of this crisis could include any or all of those pondered by strauss and howe twenty two years ago i can make the case for multiple levels of distress breaking free from their channels making 2019 as historic a year as 1939 or 1940 my prognosis for 2019 follows economic distress economic distress is mounting as the machinations of the fed wall street and the u s government prove to be nothing more than debt financed illusions once the easy money spigot is turned off and the tide of zero interest debt for wall street and mega corporations recedes you realize everyone was swimming naked the national debt grew by 1 4 trillion in 2018 during the best economy ever according to trump we added 12 trillion to the national debt and have generated a historically weak recovery especially for the working class we ve gone nine years without recession and the longest period in u s history between recessions was ten years without the tax cut stimulus interest rates higher corporate profits flagging global trade waning and central bankers withdrawing liquidity recession is likely in 2019 driving deficits towards 2 trillion the number of zombie companies ge sears jc penney chesapeake all fracking companies propped up by cheap junk bond debt is astronomical national debt default is still a ways off but a tsunami of corporate debt defaults will inundate the economy once the recession knocks the legs out from beneath this faux recovery corporations and consumers have never been more indebted stock valuations have never been higher an economy that begins to self destruct when interest rates approach 3 proves the solutions implemented by those in power did nothing for the average american while further enriching the parasitical class pulling the strings at this point a specific triggering event is unnecessary to provoke the economic conflagration the unbearable weight of unpayable debt is going to cause the structure to collapse at free fall speed like the twin towers pancaking everyone in the floors below with a recession inevitable in 2019 we know the stock market declines 30 to 40 during recessions on average when a stock market is this overvalued based solely on fed easy money and corporate buybacks apple has lost 9 billion on their buybacks this year the withdrawal of liquidity combined with recession and declining profits will knock 50 to 60 off current prices i wonder how many middle class 401k contributors expect this to happen well this will be the third time in 18 years so you would think they d learn by now recession means job losses consumer debt defaults less tax revenue for the government more wasteful spending by politicians pretending to care soaring deficits currency gyrations and the potential for rising interest rates as no one will be willing or able to buy the newly issued debt will we have massive deflation or hyperinflation anything is possible in a collapse scenario what is certain will be millions of angry americans looking for someone to blame and politicians seeking to distract them with some foreign threat to their safety and security this is when trade wars morph into real wars social distress the social distress sweeping the country gets the majority of attention on the left wing corporate media propaganda machines as they purposely fan the flames of divisiveness keeping the sheeple angry at each other keeps them distracted from the continued pillaging of the national wealth by the deep state scum operating in plain sight the daily war against the normals has reached new heights of hypocrisy and idiocy the unceasing mantra of diversity trying to normalize the lifestyles of the mentally ill glorifying socialism as venezuela implodes due to socialism promoting the climate change agenda to abscond with more taxes and trying to force left wing agendas down the throats of white traditional family oriented people is on the verge of starting civil violence as we are witnessing in france the ruling class has gone too far in accumulating the wealth of the nation through the capture of regulatory political financial and communication structures wealth inequality arisen through fraud deception and corruption will lead to class warfare likely after the next financial collapse the current government shutdown over funding for a border wall is essentially a showdown over the racial makeup of the country and allowing unfettered access to welfare benefits to illegal invaders who will loyally illegally vote for their democrat benefactors for eternity racial politics is what has kept blacks enslaved on the welfare plantation in decaying urban ghettos run by democrat politician plantation owners a black uprising led by kanye west has struck fear into the hearts of democrats giving them further incentive to keeping the southern border open to new democrat voters with gun grabbing liberal politicians attempting to disarm the deplorables in flyover country while supporting antifa and black lives matter terrorists and thwarting efforts to keep criminals and terrorists from illegally entering the country a violent showdown is inevitable political distress the political distress since the 2016 election has reached levels not seen since the civil war crisis period the deep state controllers next hand picked figurehead president hillary clinton inexplicably lost the election to a nyc reality star real estate mogul who boasted about grabbing pussies and had a weakness for strippers and playboy bunnies clinton s arrogance and hubris were her downfall as the deplorables she ridiculed and a majority of white women in the country gave trump a slim victory and drove millions of pussy hat wearing feminazis into a rage college students across the land sobbed in their safe spaces and missed their queer theory or pick your gender classes but not only were snowflakes across the land melting but the surveillance state spooks who attempted to rig the election in clinton s favor went into a frenzy as fear of their traitorous machinations being revealed forced them to begin a coup attempt against trump the mueller comey clapper brennan obama clinton reactive coup attempt is ongoing and will come to a head in 2019 the outcome of this epic struggle between the deep state and the non approved upstart president could create civil war like conditions how will trump supporters react if they believe their leader is removed through impeachment based on false charges will they take to the streets in armed insurrection will the police and military fire on their fellow citizens what if trump refuses to step down creating a constitutional crisis what if he is assassinated on the other hand what if trump s allies within the doj and military present evidence of collusion against the obama administration clinton and top officials in the fbi doj and cia how would the left wingers react to military tribunals with their beloved leaders in the docket even if these earth shattering events don t come to fruition a democrat controlled house will thwart everything trump attempts to accomplish as they position themselves for the 2020 presidential election the anger and disillusionment of the masses will deepen military distress the potential for catastrophe on the military front hasn t been higher in decades the linear thinking lemmings dismiss the possibility of a global conflict because they are just as obtuse as experts before them throughout history since world war ii we have only experienced proxy wars where the outcomes would not change the course of world history there have been no total wars where the loser is utterly shattered and complete victory is attained those who practice revisionist history act as if the previous two fourth turning total wars were completely predictable before they began in 1858 no one believed a civil war taking the lives of 700 000 americans was just over the horizon exactly 80 years later in 1938 few believed a global conflict which would kill 65 million people in six years was imminent here we are exactly 80 years later and anyone predicting a global conflagration killing millions is declared a loon every previous fourth turning has ended in total war with victory of the good guys always in doubt every total war has ratcheted up the level of death and destruction as technological advancements enhance our war making abilities human nature does not change we are not smarter less war like more humanitarian or less arrogant than our predecessors throughout history hubris power and miscalculation by egomaniacal leaders leads to war we know the climax of this fourth turning is slated for around 2025 this infers a high likelihood of a major war involving the u s in the foreseeable future will it ignite in 2019 all the combustible elements are present the onset of a global depression trade wars china russia feeling pushed into a corner and the volatile political situation in the u s and eu provide a potential pathway to global conflict economic indicators from china show the slowest economic growth in a quarter century their natives are restless plunging oil prices will throw the russian economy into recession the eu economies led by germany are seizing up with the slowdown in global trade japan has essentially been in recession since the 1990s the u s is poised for a recession in 2019 immigration chaos in europe brexit ukrainian nazis provoking russia south china sea territorial disputes the syria turkey iran israel ticking time bomb saudi anarchy socialist south american regimes imploding and u s political pandemonium have created a perfect storm of domestic and international disasters what do low life politicians do when faced with terrible domestic issues they seek to distract their citizens with a foreign threat see blame russia for everything as an example of this tried and true propaganda technique desperate politicians do desperate things to retain power desperate deep state actors care not one wit for their fellow countrymen they are willing and able to sacrifice the youth of their nation to fight wars which will further enrich themselves and their fellow traitorous benefactors we are nothing but cannon fodder to this psychopathic scum putin and xi are essentially dictators who have no fear of elections every two years they are serious men in possession of nuclear missiles capable of destroying the world blaming them for all the ills in your own country is a fool hardy tactic the ever increasing saber rattling whether in the ukraine syria south china sea or during antagonistic trade negotiations can easily lead to unintended consequences all leaders have enormous egos and are prone to over confidence and miscalculation regarding how their opponent will react someone is going to do something stupid and then all hell is going to break loose no escape the risk of catastrophe will be very high the nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence crack up geographically or succumb to authoritarian rule if there is a war it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort in other words a total war every fourth turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction and in mankind s willingness to use it history offers no guarantees obviously things could go horribly wrong the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues from terrorist anarchy to high tech dictatorship we should not assume that providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others not just temporary hardship but debasement and total ruin losing in the next fourth turning could mean something incomparably worse it could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence perhaps even our nation might never recover strauss howe the fourth turning there is no escape from the fourth turning we are midway through this crisis and the existing social order retains tenuous control over the levers of finance government and the legacy media history tells us our society will be reshaped and transformed before this crisis resolves itself sometime between now and 2029 it would be the utmost of arrogance to believe our nation will be protected from destruction by an all powerful god we ve made bad choices deferred hard decisions squandered our financial resources allowed our educational system to be corrupted and valued all the wrong things there will be consequences the overt last ditch financial debt schemes concocted by the entrenched establishment to prolong their power and control are unraveling and a death and rebirth of the social order through a chaotic cleansing is in the offing i believe the real fireworks will begin during 2019 i don t eagerly await the terrible storms headed our way i wish we didn t have to withstand the brutal gales of this coming winter but we have no choice you have to survive winter to experience the blossoming spring the coming decade will try our souls and force everyone to make choices that will make a difference the specific events are unknowable but how we react and who we support during the events will be the decisive factor in whether this fourth turning is resolved in a positive way having it resolved in negative way could be an unimaginable tragedy patrick henry made his famous give me liberty or give me death speech during the first american fourth turning his words ring true today we are already at war sides have been drawn we are going to have to fight whether we like it or not our only other choice is chains and slavery the time to choose has arrived welcome to 2019 the war is actually begun the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms our brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death patrick

business will u s face a recession in 2019 here s what forecasters say with a look to 2020 think low for 2019 low gas prices low unemployment low interest rates but one thing s higher the odds we will land in a recession forecasts focus on when not whether the next u s recession is coming the hand wringing mostly is about the united states trade war with china the federal reserve s plan for interest rate hikes oil s plunging price tag and wall street s sudden year end fire sale on stocks as for good news economists largely agree a recession is not in the cards this year despite all their buzz about a coming downturn the economy s not falling apart not by any stretch of the imagination said mark vitner senior economist at wells fargo securities economics group so why all the talk because much of the rest of the world economy already has begun to slow and that is adding to the slow down in the u s economy expected this year forecasters put off the next recession until 2020 largely because the u s economy currently enjoys a brisk pace of growth even without a recession this year might hurt this is going to feel like a fairly sharp slowdown in 2019 warned economist scott anderson at the bank of the west economic expansion will continue a recession watch seems out of place the economy s so healthy that america is about to set a record we just have to get through july without having a recession at that point the u s economic expansion which officially began july 1 2009 will have become the longest on record it will surpass the decade long expansion that followed the recession that ended in march 1991 we ll make it there s plenty of gas in the tank vitner says consumers are confident carry low debt burdens and keep spending money the tax cut that fattened paychecks in 2018 will generate a record high tax refund season according to morgan stanley s outlook for 2019 cheap gasoline prices add another boost to consumers budgets globally however the swift drop in oil prices that brought cheap gas offers more evidence that economic activity in the rest of the world is slowing down meanwhile u s employers clamor for employees raise wages at a pace largely missing throughout much of this economic expansion and see employees confidently quit because they ve found a better job investment manager ken green hears about the healthy job market when he talks with companies whose stocks he considers buying and when talking to clients who also are small business owners they have jobs to fill and have trouble filling them he said if the economy were getting toppy he said employers would be saying they re good with the staff they have we re just a long way away from that said green president of mitchell capital management in leawood statistically the nation s gross domestic product grew by about 3 percent in 2018 the strongest since the great recession ended unemployment is low at 3 7 percent and heading lower next year according to forecasts but the economy is slowing down which shows up in forecasts for growth in 2019 2 7 percent say wells fargo and ihs markit 2 3 percent say morgan stanley and moody s they also generally expect the economy to get weaker and weaker as the new year progresses pressure on the economy comes from u s import tariffs that have boosted steel and aluminum prices for u s manufacturers and from the retaliation by china against american exports more trade barriers seem likely with a march 1 deadline for reconciliation with china approaching economically the trade war already is slowing u s growth and china s growth even more economists say policymakers can fix that or make matters worse potential trade policy mistakes remain the biggest threats to global growth said nariman behravesh chief economist at ihs markit behravesh however isn t forecasting a recession this year recessions happen he said when an economy has built up a dangerous excess for example the great recession was kicked off by an excess in housing markets the recession before that by the dot com tech stock bubble and the one before that by an overblown commercial real estate market those excesses just aren t there right now in the u s economy behravesh said interest rates it seems 2020 looks more like the year for a recession anderson with bank of the west sets the odds at a coin flip s chance that s partly due to the fed s poor track record in landing the plane anderson said by landing the plane he means the fed s effort to return interest rates to normal levels after having held them near zero for seven years in the wake of the great recession the fed first raised rates in late 2015 and most recently in mid december which marked its fourth hike during 2018 along the way consumers have seen mortgages credit card balances and car loans cost a bit more business borrowings too have gotten more expensive fed chairman jay powell speaking after the december rate increase acknowledged that the fed s policymakers had been thinking about three rate increases in 2019 but pared that back to only two the number of future rate increases and when they happen will depend on what happens with the economy but wait there s more the fed also is unwinding its controversial practice of buying trillions of dollars worth of u s treasury and mortgage backed bonds to fight off the great recession those purchases called quantitative easing or qe helped the economy by holding down long term interest rates and by providing financial resources to the economy unwinding qe works on the economy much like raising interest rates does and it has some forecasters worried economist david rosenberg with gluskin sheff associates inc calculates that the fed s current unwinding plans are the equivalent of raising interest rates by an additional 1 3 percentage points in 2019 at that point rosenberg said the fed will have tightened by almost 5 5 percentage points no expansion ever survived that degree of fed policy restraint rosenberg said adding that the bond market is starting to sniff out the recession which could well begin next year others agree that the fed may end up pushing the economy into a hard landing but most likely in 2020 if they follow through with earlier plans we would absolutely no doubt be in a recession in the next 12 to 18 months said gary cloud co chief investment officer of fixed income at fci advisors in kansas city bear market wall street has had trouble taking all this in riding high until early october the dow jones industrial average suffered a 5 63 percent loss in 2018 the broader s p 500 fell 6 24 percent and the tech stock driven nasdaq 3 88 percent not terrible until you remember that investors had been counting gains just months earlier the dow had been up by 8 53 percent on oct 3 the s p up by 9 62 percent in mid september and the nasdaq up by 17 47 percent at the end of august at its worst on christmas eve the s p 500 was down 19 78 percent from its mid september peak that s within a whisker of what analysts consider a bear market which generally means stocks have fallen by 20 percent or more the nasdaq and the russell 2000 a stock index made up of smaller companies shares each mathematically entered a bear market in december the stock market is acting like recession is around the corner said ed yardeni of yardeni research some worry that the stock market may lead the economy into a recession in the past investors have suffered a bear market without a recession but yardeni points out that drop included the october 1987 crash when markets fell more than 20 percent in one day another point to keep in mind is that at least since world war ii there hasn t been a recession without a bear market in stocks an optimist would say the downdraft means stocks are relatively cheap compared to just a few months ago optimism is hard to come by stock prices need to find some stability first said bill greiner chief economist at mariner wealth advisors in overland park currently he is neutral on stocks as we start to see some degree of stability we re looking for ideas looking for ways to deploy capital greiner said there s probably one more at least one more push upward in equity prices in 2019 equity investors can expect some big ups an downs waiting for the trade war to end and the federal reserve to find the right path said douglas coe managing director at moody reid in kansas city his cure is a diversified portfolio investors need a mixture of stocks bonds and cash like holdings their stocks need to come from a diversified mix of companies big medium and small and from a mix of markets u s and international we went nine years with artificially low rates we have to somehow normalize that and it s not going to be pretty coe said but if we do it gradually equity investors will come out fine this story was originally published january 1 2019 5 30 am

2019 from a fourth turning perspective an impasse over the federal budget reaches a stalemate the president and congress both refuse to back down triggering a near total government shutdown the president declares emergency powers congress rescinds his authority dollar and bond prices plummet the president threatens to stop social security checks congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling default looms wall street panics the fourth turning strauss howe an impasse over the federal budget reaches a stalemate the president and congress both refuse to back down triggering a near total government shutdown the president declares emergency powers congress rescinds his authority dollar and bond prices plummet the president threatens to stop social security checks congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling default looms wall street panics the fourth turning strauss howe strauss and howe wrote their book in 1996 they were not trying to be prophets of doom but observers of history able to connect events through human life cycles of 80 or so years using critical thinking skills and identifying the most likely triggers for crisis debt civic decay and global disorder they were able to anticipate scenarios which could drive the next crisis which they warned would arrive in the mid 2000 decade the scenario described above is fairly close to the current situation driven by the showdown between trump and the democrats regarding the border wall it has not reached the stage where all hell breaks loose but if it extends until the end of january and food stamp money is not distributed to 40 million people mostly in urban ghettos all bets are off the likelihood of this scenario is small but there are numerous potential triggers which could still make 2019 go down in history as a year to remember as we enter the eleventh year of this fourth turning the fourth crisis period in u s history the mood of u s citizens and citizens around the globe continues to darken fourth turnings are driven by generational configuration and the emotional reaction to events by the prophet generation leaders nomad generation spearheads and hero generation cannon fodder as we close out this year stock markets are gyrating wildly central bankers are trying to reverse their nine years of interventionist strategies to sustain the establishment civil chaos spreads across the european continent saber rattling between the u s russia and china increases the animosity between political parties reaches new heights the deep state relentlessly pursues their mueller led coup against trump mega social media corporations tighten their grip on free speech by silencing conservatives leftists push their socialist open borders normalizing degeneracy agenda and global recession gains momentum as trade declines and global debt reaches unserviceable levels examining the three prior fourth turnings may give us a window into where we stand and what may happen in the coming year we are in the tenth year of this crisis with the eleven year anniversary slated for september 2019 the american revolution crisis was catalyzed in 1773 when the boston tea party forever changed the colonial mood towards revolution after eight years of struggle and desperate measures the climax was reached with the surrender of cornwallis at yorktown in 1781 but there was still thirteen more years of crisis as the new states forged a constitution elected washington its first president and he withstood the jacobins put down the whiskey rebellion and finalized a treaty with england in year ten of the crisis two years past the climax the treaty of paris was signed british troops left the continent and washington resigned as commander of american troops the articles of confederation had been ratified in 1781 and remained in place until succeeded by the u s constitution in 1789 there was no tenth or eleventh year of the civil war crisis lincoln s election with only 40 of the popular vote prompting the attack on fort sumpter and subsequent secession of southern states triggered the bloodiest conflict in world history with 8 of all white men aged 13 to 43 killed in the war including 6 in the north and 18 in the south the acceleration of this fourth turning into a five year window from 1860 to 1865 was not a positive development the extreme intensity of the conflict resulted in 700 000 tragic deaths the catalyst occurred five years too soon and the resolution a generation too soon a more extended crisis may have allowed tempers to moderate and the conflict to end in a more constructive manner instead with the surrender at appomattox and assassination of lincoln the resolution felt more like a defeat than a victory turmoil continued for at least a decade after the resolution the great depression world war ii crisis saw its tenth and eleventh years as the most ominous dangerous and destructive for great britain as they bore the brunt of the german onslaught 1939 saw the nazi invasion of poland and the official start of world war ii in may of 1940 germany launched its blitzkrieg offensive through holland and belgium defeating the french and british forces in a matter of weeks chamberlain resigned as prime minister replaced by churchill as france surrendered in late june the battle of britain raged from july through october as hitler relentlessly bombed england trying to force their surrender germany italy and japan signed the tripartite pact in september setting the stage for the u s eventual participation in the war einstein informed fdr of the potential for an atomic bomb during 1939 and the manhattan project was born the climax of the crisis occurred with the successful d day invasion the dropping of two atomic bombs on japan and successful demobilization of military forces marked the end of the crisis history may not repeat but human nature never changes so the 80 year cycles of manmade crisis will repeat the length of time from the american revolution climax in 1781 until the civil war climax in 1863 was 82 years the next climax in 1944 was 81 years after the civil war climax therefore we can expect a climax to this current crisis sometime in the 2025 range the question is what events will transpire between 2019 and 2025 before a climax is reached based upon history the resolution will not be based on compromise civility reason or peaceful means the combustible combination of unpayable debt civic anarchy and global chaos are set to detonate creating an era of maximum darkness death destruction and decisions making america great again will require personal sacrifice dreadful choices survival skills intelligent decisions and the courage to win at all costs the first ten years of this crisis were the early winter solstice period when public order began to pass its nadir the coldest days of winter beckon with the harshest years of the crisis ahead many melancholy days lie ahead as bitter winter winds and blizzard like conditions sweep the bleak landscape testing the mettle of even the bravest souls the catalyst for the crisis was the wall street created global financial meltdown in 2008 the election of trump marked the beginning of the regeneracy with trump as the gray champion the last two years have certainly marked a new more volatile phase of this crisis setting the stage for the fireworks to come the regeneracy is less like fdr s new deal initiated unification of the country and more like the lincoln regeneracy after the first battle of bull run when he ordered the enlistment of a half million men to fight a like number of fellow american men both american factions were unified in their cause the chain reaction of emergencies and unyielding responses will continue unabated until a final resolution is achieved in retrospect the spark might seem as ominous as a financial crash as ordinary as a national election or as trivial as a tea party the catalyst will unfold according to a basic crisis dynamic that underlies all of these scenarios an initial spark will trigger a chain reaction of unyielding responses and further emergencies the core elements of these scenarios debt civic decay global disorder will matter more than the details which the catalyst will juxtapose and connect in some unknowable way if foreign societies are also entering a fourth turning this could accelerate the chain reaction at home and abroad these events will reflect the tearing of the civic fabric at points of extreme vulnerability problem areas where america will have neglected denied or delayed needed action the fourth turning strauss howe strauss and howe foresaw the core elements which would surely propel the next fourth turning they were plain to see for people who chose to see the world with eyes wide open debt civic decay and global disorder are on center stage as we enter the fateful year of 2019 a madness seems to be gripping the nation a melancholy realization all is not right everything has a chaotic feel as financial markets are falling politicians threaten and attack each other government dysfunction is laid bare for all to see deep state snakes slither behind the scenes trying to bring down trump racial tensions grow foreign governments topple russia and china challenge u s hegemony and the global debt ponzi scheme is entering its collapse phase there are no moderates only pro trump and anti trump factions compromise and workable solutions to our deep seated problems are off the table the mood of the populace ranges from frustrated and angry to depressed and stressed the aroma of conflict wafts through the air as battle lines are being drawn the initial spark of a global financial meltdown created by greedy wall street banks the feckless fed and corrupt government officials was driven by bad debt outright control fraud by the financial industry captured rating agencies easy money provided by the wall street owned fed and utter contempt for properly regulating the wall street cabal by the fed and sec this emergency was met by an unyielding response from the establishment with the easiest money policies in world history bailing out criminal bankers with taxpayer funds increasing global debt by 80 trillion to 250 trillion 318 of global gdp running fiscal deficits exceeding 1 trillion per year and pretending all that debt will be repaid pretend and extend has been the solution the deep state has taken extraordinary measures to try and retain their stranglehold on the wealth of the nation and control of the political financial social and media levers of society they have utilized a combination of propaganda disguised as news social media distractions technological surveillance misinformation campaigns welfare to keep the poor sedated and the continued issuance of debt to keep the masses satiated with consumer goods as their wealth dissipates but the teetering edifice of debt delusion and deception is poised to topple in 2019 as we enter 2019 year eleven of this ongoing crisis you can sense the panic and distress permeating from the pores of the establishment figures and their rich shadowy benefactors trying to maintain their unseen presence behind the curtain as they pull the strings operating as the invisible government running the show for their own benefit it seems the unanticipated election of trump has thrown a monkey wrench into their well oiled pillage machine forcing them to reveal themselves as they attempt a not so subtle coup against a sitting president fourth turnings always sweep away the existing social order in a torrent of violent upheaval and the blood of young men but that doesn t mean the existing establishment will give up their wealth power and control without a fight and the fight is underway the volcano has erupted and the molten lava could flow in numerous pathways over the next six or so years imagine some national and probably global volcanic eruption initially flowing along channels of distress that were created during the unraveling era and further widened by the catalyst trying to foresee where the eruption will go once it bursts free of the channels is like trying to predict the exact fault line of an earthquake all you know in advance is something about the molten ingredients of the climax which could include the following economic distress with public debt in default entitlement trust funds in bankruptcy mounting poverty and unemployment trade wars collapsing financial markets and hyperinflation or deflation social distress with violence fueled by class race nativism or religion and abetted by armed gangs underground militias and mercenaries hired by walled communities political distress with institutional collapse open tax revolts one party hegemony major constitutional change secessionism authoritarianism and altered national borders military distress with war against terrorists or foreign regimes equipped with weapons of mass destruction the fourth turning strauss howe the ingredients of distress in the next phase of this crisis could include any or all of those pondered by strauss and howe twenty two years ago i can make the case for multiple levels of distress breaking free from their channels making 2019 as historic a year as 1939 or 1940 my prognosis for 2019 follows economic distress economic distress is mounting as the machinations of the fed wall street and the u s government prove to be nothing more than debt financed illusions once the easy money spigot is turned off and the tide of zero interest debt for wall street and mega corporations recedes you realize everyone was swimming naked the national debt grew by 1 4 trillion in 2018 during the best economy ever according to trump we added 12 trillion to the national debt and have generated a historically weak recovery especially for the working class we ve gone nine years without recession and the longest period in u s history between recessions was ten years without the tax cut stimulus interest rates higher corporate profits flagging global trade waning and central bankers withdrawing liquidity recession is likely in 2019 driving deficits towards 2 trillion the number of zombie companies ge sears jc penney chesapeake all fracking companies propped up by cheap junk bond debt is astronomical national debt default is still a ways off but a tsunami of corporate debt defaults will inundate the economy once the recession knocks the legs out from beneath this faux recovery corporations and consumers have never been more indebted stock valuations have never been higher an economy that begins to self destruct when interest rates approach 3 proves the solutions implemented by those in power did nothing for the average american while further enriching the parasitical class pulling the strings at this point a specific triggering event is unnecessary to provoke the economic conflagration the unbearable weight of unpayable debt is going to cause the structure to collapse at free fall speed like the twin towers pancaking everyone in the floors below with a recession inevitable in 2019 we know the stock market declines 30 to 40 during recessions on average when a stock market is this overvalued based solely on fed easy money and corporate buybacks apple has lost 9 billion on their buybacks this year the withdrawal of liquidity combined with recession and declining profits will knock 50 to 60 off current prices i wonder how many middle class 401k contributors expect this to happen well this will be the third time in 18 years so you would think they d learn by now recession means job losses consumer debt defaults less tax revenue for the government more wasteful spending by politicians pretending to care soaring deficits currency gyrations and the potential for rising interest rates as no one will be willing or able to buy the newly issued debt will we have massive deflation or hyperinflation anything is possible in a collapse scenario what is certain will be millions of angry americans looking for someone to blame and politicians seeking to distract them with some foreign threat to their safety and security this is when trade wars morph into real wars social distress the social distress sweeping the country gets the majority of attention on the left wing corporate media propaganda machines as they purposely fan the flames of divisiveness keeping the sheeple angry at each other keeps them distracted from the continued pillaging of the national wealth by the deep state scum operating in plain sight the daily war against the normals has reached new heights of hypocrisy and idiocy the unceasing mantra of diversity trying to normalize the lifestyles of the mentally ill glorifying socialism as venezuela implodes due to socialism promoting the climate change agenda to abscond with more taxes and trying to force left wing agendas down the throats of white traditional family oriented people is on the verge of starting civil violence as we are witnessing in france the ruling class has gone too far in accumulating the wealth of the nation through the capture of regulatory political financial and communication structures wealth inequality arisen through fraud deception and corruption will lead to class warfare likely after the next financial collapse the current government shutdown over funding for a border wall is essentially a showdown over the racial makeup of the country and allowing unfettered access to welfare benefits to illegal invaders who will loyally illegally vote for their democrat benefactors for eternity racial politics is what has kept blacks enslaved on the welfare plantation in decaying urban ghettos run by democrat politician plantation owners a black uprising led by kanye west has struck fear into the hearts of democrats giving them further incentive to keeping the southern border open to new democrat voters with gun grabbing liberal politicians attempting to disarm the deplorables in flyover country while supporting antifa and black lives matter terrorists and thwarting efforts to keep criminals and terrorists from illegally entering the country a violent showdown is inevitable political distress the political distress since the 2016 election has reached levels not seen since the civil war crisis period the deep state controllers next hand picked figurehead president hillary clinton inexplicably lost the election to a nyc reality star real estate mogul who boasted about grabbing pussies and had a weakness for strippers and playboy bunnies clinton s arrogance and hubris were her downfall as the deplorables she ridiculed and a majority of white women in the country gave trump a slim victory and drove millions of hat wearing feminazis into a rage college students across the land sobbed in their safe spaces and missed their queer theory or pick your gender classes but not only were snowflakes across the land melting but the surveillance state spooks who attempted to rig the election in clinton s favor went into a frenzy as fear of their traitorous machinations being revealed forced them to begin a coup attempt against trump the mueller comey clapper brennan obama clinton reactive coup attempt is ongoing and will come to a head in 2019 the outcome of this epic struggle between the deep state and the non approved upstart president could create civil war like conditions how will trump supporters react if they believe their leader is removed through impeachment based on false charges will they take to the streets in armed insurrection will the police and military fire on their fellow citizens what if trump refuses to step down creating a constitutional crisis what if he is assassinated on the other hand what if trump s allies within the doj and military present evidence of collusion against the obama administration clinton and top officials in the fbi doj and cia how would the left wingers react to military tribunals with their beloved leaders in the docket even if these earth shattering events don t come to fruition a democrat controlled house will thwart everything trump attempts to accomplish as they position themselves for the 2020 presidential election the anger and disillusionment of the masses will deepen military distress the potential for catastrophe on the military front hasn t been higher in decades the linear thinking lemmings dismiss the possibility of a global conflict because they are just as obtuse as experts before them throughout history since world war ii we have only experienced proxy wars where the outcomes would not change the course of world history there have been no total wars where the loser is utterly shattered and complete victory is attained those who practice revisionist history act as if the previous two fourth turning total wars were completely predictable before they began in 1858 no one believed a civil war taking the lives of 700 000 americans was just over the horizon exactly 80 years later in 1938 few believed a global conflict which would kill 65 million people in six years was imminent here we are exactly 80 years later and anyone predicting a global conflagration killing millions is declared a loon every previous fourth turning has ended in total war with victory of the good guys always in doubt every total war has ratcheted up the level of death and destruction as technological advancements enhance our war making abilities human nature does not change we are not smarter less war like more humanitarian or less arrogant than our predecessors throughout history hubris power and miscalculation by egomaniacal leaders leads to war we know the climax of this fourth turning is slated for around 2025 this infers a high likelihood of a major war involving the u s in the foreseeable future will it ignite in 2019 all the combustible elements are present the onset of a global depression trade wars china russia feeling pushed into a corner and the volatile political situation in the u s and eu provide a potential pathway to global conflict economic indicators from china show the slowest economic growth in a quarter century their natives are restless plunging oil prices will throw the russian economy into recession the eu economies led by germany are seizing up with the slowdown in global trade japan has essentially been in recession since the 1990s the u s is poised for a recession in 2019 immigration chaos in europe brexit ukrainian nazis provoking russia south china sea territorial disputes the syria turkey iran israel ticking time bomb saudi anarchy socialist south american regimes imploding and u s political pandemonium have created a perfect storm of domestic and international disasters what do low life politicians do when faced with terrible domestic issues they seek to distract their citizens with a foreign threat see blame russia for everything as an example of this tried and true propaganda technique desperate politicians do desperate things to retain power desperate deep state actors care not one wit for their fellow countrymen they are willing and able to sacrifice the youth of their nation to fight wars which will further enrich themselves and their fellow traitorous benefactors we are nothing but cannon fodder to this psychopathic scum putin and xi are essentially dictators who have no fear of elections every two years they are serious men in possession of nuclear missiles capable of destroying the world blaming them for all the ills in your own country is a fool hardy tactic the ever increasing saber rattling whether in the ukraine syria south china sea or during antagonistic trade negotiations can easily lead to unintended consequences all leaders have enormous egos and are prone to over confidence and miscalculation regarding how their opponent will react someone is going to do something stupid and then all hell is going to break loose no escape the risk of catastrophe will be very high the nation could erupt into insurrection or civil violence crack up geographically or succumb to authoritarian rule if there is a war it is likely to be one of maximum risk and effort in other words a total war every fourth turning has registered an upward ratchet in the technology of destruction and in mankind s willingness to use it history offers no guarantees obviously things could go horribly wrong the possibilities ranging from a nuclear exchange to incurable plagues from terrorist anarchy to high tech dictatorship we should not assume that providence will always exempt our nation from the irreversible tragedies that have overtaken so many others not just temporary hardship but debasement and total ruin losing in the next fourth turning could mean something incomparably worse it could mean a lasting defeat from which our national innocence perhaps even our nation might never recover strauss howe the fourth turning there is no escape from the fourth turning we are midway through this crisis and the existing social order retains tenuous control over the levers of finance government and the legacy media history tells us our society will be reshaped and transformed before this crisis resolves itself sometime between now and 2029 it would be the utmost of arrogance to believe our nation will be protected from destruction by an all powerful god we ve made bad choices deferred hard decisions squandered our financial resources allowed our educational system to be corrupted and valued all the wrong things there will be consequences the overt last ditch financial debt schemes concocted by the entrenched establishment to prolong their power and control are unraveling and a death and rebirth of the social order through a chaotic cleansing is in the offing i believe the real fireworks will begin during 2019 i don t eagerly await the terrible storms headed our way i wish we didn t have to withstand the brutal gales of this coming winter but we have no choice you have to survive winter to experience the blossoming spring the coming decade will try our souls and force everyone to make choices that will make a difference the specific events are unknowable but how we react and who we support during the events will be the decisive factor in whether this fourth turning is resolved in a positive way having it resolved in negative way could be an unimaginable tragedy patrick henry made his famous give me liberty or give me death speech during the first american fourth turning his words ring true today we are already at war sides have been drawn we are going to have to fight whether we like it or not our only other choice is chains and slavery the time to choose has arrived welcome to 2019 the war is actually begun the next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms our brethren are already in the field why stand we here idle what is it that gentlemen wish what would they have is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery forbid it almighty god i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death patrick henry 1775 emigrate while you still can join me at www theburningplatform com to discuss truth and the future of our country by james

through much of 2018 canada s unemployment rate hovered near a 40 year low the canadian economy entered 2018 on an unexpectedly impressive run the country begins 2019 on a healthy note but signs of weakness have raised a key question how long until the good times come to an end through much of 2018 canada s unemployment rate hovered near a 40 year low and job creation remained strong as the evidence pointed to an economy going at close to full tilt the handoff was a good one too the country had posted three per cent growth for all of 2017 largely thanks to strong household spending we ll have to wait a little for the final numbers but forecasters say 2018 has likely delivered still sturdy growth of about two per cent but as 2019 approaches there are worries the solid economic expansion is starting to show its age last month the federal government s fall economic statement projected two per cent growth again for 2019 but many predict the number will likely come in lower following a recent drop in oil prices in addition to the pullback in crude prices experts point to jitters in the financial markets predictions the american economy a key contributor to canadian growth will start to cool off and the united kingdom s difficult divorce from the european union which could ripple across the global economy read more fix low incomes among family class immigrants to help canada s economy study there s also potential for an even bigger threat an escalation of the trade war between washington and beijing on trade canada made it through a year filled with significant uncertainty including the difficult negotiation and signing of an update to the north american free trade agreement many of the trade unknowns however will carry over into the new year the road to nafta 2 0 s ratification could bring more drama punishing american steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place and the clash of superpowers between canada s two biggest trading partners continues to play out there are always reflections around the cyclical downturns that happen and as i ve said the impacts of a trade war between china and the united states could have significant impacts on the global economy negative impacts on the global economy prime minister justin trudeau said in a recent interview with the canadian press we have to make sure that we are prepared for rough waters if we encounter them in canada potential trouble spots include the combination of high household debt rising interest rates and slowing wage growth that s been terrible for about half a year following a good pickup early in 2018 says matt stewart director of economics for the conference board of canada higher interest rates stewart added have delivered a hit to household spending which has been the primary driver of canada s good economic fortunes it s been a long time since we ve had a recession stewart said as of yet i think most of the news is still positive but there is a growing amount of risks with overburdened consumers expected to take a breather business investment is seen as the next critical source of growth but stewart said the transition has yet to materialize because investment has underperformed likely due to competitiveness concerns businesses aren t sure whether canada s the best place to put their money in an effort to boost investment ottawa announced billions of dollars worth of corporate tax incentives in its fall statement taxpayers will have to wait and see if the federal changes will be enough to encourage more companies to invest in canada craig alexander chief economist of deloitte said the economy will continue to have healthy growth in 2019 but notes it s due for some moderation we are in the late stages of a business cycle he said that doesn t mean that a recession is around the corner but we need to recognize that we re 10 years into an economic recovery expansion business cycles are typically eight to 10 years long alexander added markets are probably overreacting to the possibility that another downturn could be almost upon us he thinks the more likely case is that growth will continue to slow the economy s evolution will have different impacts depending where one lives he added for example the energy sector faces big challenges part of it comes from the recent plunge in oil prices but there s also been an extra discount on the price of western canadian crude caused by transportation bottlenecks out of the alberta oilpatch this is sad news for alberta alexander said they ve only barely recovered from the last recession ottawa offered assistance this month in the form of a 1 6 billion aid package to support oil and gas companies alberta however wants federal help to move its oil to new markets ontario s industrial sector will also face a big hurdle in 2019 general motors has announced plans to shutter its plant in oshawa later in the year which will put 2 500 people out of work and inflict economic pain on the region bank of montreal chief economist doug porter said canada already took a small step back in 2018 and he expects growth to slow further just looking at financial markets there s obviously a lot of concern that we are getting to a late stage of the economic cycle porter said we don t believe that recession risks are especially high at this point but we do think the north american economy will cool in 2019 andy blatchford the canadian press like us on facebook and follow us on twitter

economic competition among nations is more of a beauty contest than a footrace in reality every economy performs under its own spotlight by that reckoning as the new year dawns it s already obvious which economy is likely to be crowned miss world 2019 economic competition among nations is more of a beauty contest than a footrace in reality every economy performs under its own spotlight by that reckoning as the new year dawns it s already obvious which economy is likely to be crowned miss world 2019 yes it s last year s pageant winner the still booming u s economy despite the recent turmoil on wall street and problems with income inequality debt and policy paralysis and the tariff war launched by president donald trump most economists say the united states is far outpacing all rivals in growth and stability at the very least the u s keeps coming out tops in the least ugly contest said adam posen the president of the peterson institute for international economics piie it gets uglier all the time but it s still winning the world will be a worse place under many of the things the trump administration is doing and the environment for private sector investment will get worse for everybody including in the united states but the united states will maintain a relative lead for some time to come a quick survey of other major economies around the world explains this simple reality everyone else s situation is much uglier britain is beset by brexit and europe is grappling with an exploding budget crisis in italy its fourth largest economy along with governance issues so deep that they verge on existential china burdened with a dangerous amount of corporate debt is slowing to such a degree that most experts see it as a likely flash point in the year ahead japan s super slow growth rate an annual expectation now because of its shrinking population isn t causing it too much trouble 1 percent growth can be adequate if fewer people are producing but tokyo is still saddled with high public debt the organization for economic cooperation and development is still holding to its assessment from last fall that the united states is set to grow faster than the other g 7 countries in 2018 and 2019 and the differences among them are only widening the international monetary fund imf is forecasting close to 3 percent growth though that could go as low as 2 5 percent because of the escalating tariff war and the waning effect of trump s 2017 corporate tax cut stimulus if you just look at growth rates the length of the expansion the level of unemployment and very subdued inflationary pressures all those things look good said gian maria milesi ferretti the deputy director of the imf s research department europe by contrast looks like it is slowing more rapidly than we had envisaged now of course you also have a very substantial fiscal stimulus in the system an unprecedented one for an economy at full employment some economists are more pessimistic late last year the bond yield curve became inverted some longer term bonds began paying less than shorter term bonds suggesting widening market fears that a u s recession could loom sometime in the next two years goldman sachs s chief economist jan hatzius predicts that after enjoying 2 5 percent and 2 2 percent growth in the first two quarters of 2019 the fading tax cut stimulus and tightening by the federal reserve will drive u s growth down below 2 percent in the last two quarters but even a deceleration of that magnitude would still leave the u s economy looking a little less ugly than europe s or japan s trump is all too familiar with beauty contests of course he once co owned miss universe and the president is now taking all the credit for guiding the united states to the world crown saying his tax cut unleashed an economic miracle in fact apart from the sugar high that his tax cut and deregulatory moves gave to an already surging economy little that trump has done has made much of a difference indeed his trade war is creating new headwinds corporate profits are up and even long stagnant wages are starting to rise all this offers yet another lesson in how a society and its politics can sometimes seem diseased in america s case viciously divided by hatred and violence political paralysis and a widely unpopular president without affecting the rude health of the underlying economy as adam smith once noted there is a great deal of ruin in a nation in other words it takes a lot of screwing up by political leaders to disrupt an economy the reality is that trump is perhaps one of the luckiest presidents in decades because he is reaping the unique benefits of a host of recovery policies put in place during the preceding eight years together these policies have generated one of the longest periods of continuous economic growth in u s history in which january would mark the 100th straight month of job creation that is the longest stretch since records have been kept harvard university s kenneth rogoff who co wrote what is widely considered the definitive book on financial crisis recovery this time is different said the very factors that made the 2008 crash so devastating and enduring in impact are now helping to extend the recovery you re going to see that the next 10 years will be better than the last 10 years part of the reason the boom has been so sustained is bound up with the 2008 crisis itself serious financial crises lead to a particular kind of recession usually more severe according to rogoff and his co author carmen reinhart and a particular kind of long term recovery in a normal recovery when demand bounces back people start to buy a lot of goods but after a financial crash people take a long time to deleverage and improve their personal business or local government balance sheets thus recoveries come slower and less robust at first but there is a longer term payoff in stable growth once people finally have their balance sheets in a good place and their confidence up they start to spend and invest and hire more i think that is what we have seen here said gene sperling who led the national economic council under former president barack obama every single positive thing trump wants to brag about was just a continuation of a trend that had been in place for years under obama many economists such as posen and rogoff foresee problems for the u s economy due to social and political upheaval tied to income inequality which is barely being addressed we ve made a lot of longer run compromises rogoff said apart from corporations the tax cut benefited mainly the rich for example while tariffs and cutting back on immigration will hurt the economy in the long run what the u s economy is doing under trump is closer to taking steroids than sugar rogoff said you feel good for many years until eventually things catch up with you even so there is a broad consensus that the real economic crises in the foreseeable future lie abroad according to adam tooze a professor at columbia university china and other emerging markets are the central driver of global growth right now but there are serious questions about whether beijing s autocratic and increasingly inward looking leader xi jinping and his bureaucracy can handle the growth slowdown or unwind the extraordinary buildup of debt in chinese companies faced with a barrage of trump tariffs china s estimated growth for 2019 has been reduced to 6 2 percent according to the imf that s good for most economies but the authoritarian chinese government has generally required faster growth to satisfy a restive population while india and countries in the association of southeast asian nations appear stable latin america is struggling said milesi ferretti the imf economist argentina is slowing growth in brazil and mexico is subdued and venezuela is a catastrophe meanwhile the refusal of the italian government to bow to budget cutting demands from the european commission has led to the latest existential crisis in the eu where demands for austerity by germany the largest economy have put it in a seemingly permanent state of conflict with other economies in the current context added posen piie s president where there is so much anti europe sentiment and economic nationalism look at hungary poland and le pen continuing to snipe at macron s heels in france you have to conclude yeah maybe once again we re still the least ugly this article originally appeared in the winter 2019 issue of foreign policy magazine

overshadows world economy and china in recent weeks the u s economy has become increasingly exposed to policy mistakes and drastic market fluctuations in 2019 chinese economy will have to cope with great international uncertainty and even more extraordinary market volatility short term fluctuations versus longer term trends recently new york times reported that china was amid a steep downturn indeed since the u s trade wars last spring there has been much chatter in the west about the china s economic slowdown once again the not so informed observers have focused on quarterly growth at the expense of annualized growth in this regard 2018 was an exceptional year in china and elsewhere in the first half global recovery was still gaining ground in the second half trump s trade wars caused substantial collateral damage that will be felt even more in 2019 in the absence of a constructive reconciliation yet china s growth forecast for 2018 remains 6 5 6 6 after a strong first half moderation will ensue in the second half and especially in 2019 depending on u s tariffs and slower demand worldwide for 2019 chinese gdp growth could eventually achieve around 6 2 in full year growth assuming policymakers succeed in the challenging balancing act to sustain higher quality growth while suppressing faster debt accumulation the government s gdp growth target which may be formally announced only next march is likely to reflect steady deceleration due to international headwinds particularly the trade wars and more secular pressures such as demographics slowing cyclical growth and other environmental debt and real estate market issues overall such deceleration is normal after years of rapid industrialization and growth acceleration however decelerating growth but rising incomes if chinese government would ignore its commitment to poverty eradication higher living standards and sustainability it could achieve more rapid growth but only at the cost of people s livelihood living standards and environment on the other hand policymakers cannot accept too much deceleration either while the country s economic growth is decelerating chinese living standards should continue to rise the effort to double average incomes as measured by gdp per capita with purchasing power parity between 2010 and 2020 requires growth to remain around 6 1 in 2019 2020 in international comparison chinese growth rate is currently positioned to decelerate from 9 6 to 5 6 between 2008 and 2023 despite this deceleration living standards will almost double in 2008 chinese gdp per capita was less than 7 900 by 2023 it could increase to more than 21 200 that would indicate that chinese living standards would almost double in 2010 20 figure figure china s growth deceleration rising per capita incomes 2008 e2023 growth rate gdp constant prices percent change per capita income gdp per capita constant prices purchasing power parity 2011 international dollars source imf weo database difference group furthermore since current growth is around 6 5 policy authorities are likely to prefer gradual deceleration which fosters stability over more abrupt slowing growth which is perceived as disruptive finally china s potential growth continues to indicate that a growth rate that exceeds 6 0 is achievable and viable though certainly not an easy task in the current international environment fiscal monetary accommodation and rebalancing the government is likely to prefer supportive fiscal policy as the primary tool to ensure stable growth in this quest fixed investment particularly infrastructure is expected to play a key role as consumption and export growth are likely to slow the former due to increasing consumer caution the latter due to the trade wars china s monetary stance is likely to remain accommodative which implies mild but manageable rise in inflation closer to 2 5 rather than 2 2 in 2018 consequently chinese yuan is likely to soften against the u s dollar up to 7 0 as long as the current tensions overshadow the bilateral u s sino relations while washington is pushing for abrupt changes in chinese economic policies beijing will stay the course as president xi jinping said in the recent 40 year anniversary of chinese economic reforms in practice policy focus will continue to shift from cyclical stimulus and debt fueled growth toward structural reforms higher quality growth and the rebalancing of chinese economy from investment and exports toward consumption and innovation by 2030 elusive international headwinds if in the course of 2019 u s trade wars broaden disruptively from exports to investment and intellectual property international environment may require substantial downgrading of economic prospects in many major economies even in a benign scenario the global recovery that began in the advanced west in the aftermath of the global crisis of 2008 thanks in great part to china s dramatic growth through those years is set to slow down in 2019 20 the major advanced economies are heading toward a complicated economically challenging and politically divisive stagnation unfortunately much of these downside risks remain under valued in the west the greater the gap between misguided perceptions and economic realities the more challenging will be the awakening dr steinbock is the founder of the

by ron paul zerohedge com tue 01 01 2019 while congress and the president fight over funding a border wall they continue to ignore the coming economic tsunami caused by the approximately 22 trillion dollars and rapidly increasing federal debt president trump may not be troubled by the debt s effect on the economy because he believes he will be out of office before it becomes a major problem however the crisis may come sooner than he or most people in dc expects the constituency for limited government while growing is still far outnumbered by those wanting government to provide economic and personal security from lower income americans who rely on food stamps public housing and other government programs to middle class americans who live in homes they could not afford without assistance from federal agencies like fannies mae and freddie mac to college students reliant on government subsidized student loans to senior citizens reliant on social security and medicare to billionaire ceos whose companies rely on bailouts subsidies laws and regulations written to benefit politically powerful businesses and government contracts most americans are reliant on at least one federal program many programs are designed to force individuals to accept government aid for example it is almost impossible for a senior citizen to obtain health insurance outside of medicare the welfare state is fueled by the federal reserve s easy money policies which are also responsible for the boom and bust cycle that plagues our economy the federal reserve s policies do not just distort our economy they also distort our values as the fed s dollar depreciation causes individuals to forgo savings and hard work in favor of immediate gratification this has helped create an explosion of business and individual debt there has been a proliferation of bubbles including in credit card debt auto loans and student loans there is even a new housing bubble an economy built on fiat currency and public and private debt is unsustainable eventually the bubbles will burst the most likely outcome will be the rejection of the dollar s world reserve currency status due to government debt and the federal reserve s monetization of debt when the bubbles pop the result will be an economic crisis that will likely dwarf the great depression the fall of the dollar and the accompanying economic downturn will make it impossible for the government to continue running up huge debts to finance a massive welfare warfare state thus congress will be forced to raise taxes and cut benefits cowardly politicians will likely outsource the job of raising taxes and cutting benefits to the federal reserve this will cause a dramatic increase in the most insidious of taxes the inflation tax as the federal reserve erodes the value of the dollar thus reducing the value of both earned paychecks and government provided welfare benefits a large number of americans who believe they are entitled to economic security will react by engaging in acts of violence politicians will use this violence to further crack down on civil liberties the resulting economic and civil unrest will further the growth of authoritarian political movements fortunately the liberty movement continues to grow this movement counters the authoritarian lies with the truths of austrian economics and the non aggression principle while the years ahead may be tough if those of us who know the truth work hard to educate others the cause of liberty can prevail

in kigali rwanda on march 21 2018 five years after the 50th anniversary of the creation of the organisation of african unity oau african union au considered in the newspeak of the au as fifty years of success 44 of the au s 55 member states signed the agreement concerning the creation of the african continental free trade area afcfta a single continental market for goods and services with free movement of business persons and investments suppression of customs tariffs is supposed to boost intra african trade which represents around 12 15 of africa s exchanges well below the internal exchanges of other continents which makes africa the most open region to world trade in the event of ratification by 22 of the signatory states by late 2018 early 2019 intra african trade is slated to exceed 50 by 2022 it is a major stage in the process of african integration which should culminate in the african economic community aec the objective of the au programme for the following half century entitled agenda 2063 the africa we want or an integrated prosperous and peaceful africa driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the international arena this project is based on a supposed capitalist economic dynamism of africa expressed by the average rate of growth of its gdp which since the first decade of the 21st century has been above the world average making africa the second locomotive region after asia of world growth thus some african and indeed non african voices consider this as africa s century an afro optimism which seems in correlation with a renaissance or renewal of pan africanist discourse outside the au among the african intelligentsia and employers for the boosters of this supposed african economic dynamism there would be no incompatibility between the pan africanist ideal of the emancipation of the african peoples and the rooting of the supposed african economic dynamic in the neoliberalisation of capitalist globalisation yet the train of african integration risks ending up at a terminus other than that of the emancipation of the african peoples the oau and the african economic community project the idea of a single african market an african economic community is not a novelty it is linked to that of pan africanism as officially discussed immediately after the massive emergence of newly independent african states in the early 1960s thus on the eve of the creation of the oau one of the main protagonists in the debate ghana s president kwame nkrumah stressed the economic dimension of the gestating african unity or union but abstracting from this the question of social classes and their antagonistic interests resting on the principle of the african personality as well as the bandung spirt to win his fellow heads of state most of them comfortably installed in the networks of neo colonialism to the project of a unity and economic solidarity of african states in the interests of the african peoples it was in his view a condition for the conservation of political independence recently acquired by the great majority of african states and for the decolonisation of the entities remaining under the colonial yoke an african common market devoted uniquely to african interests would more efficaciously promote the true requirements of the african states such an african market presupposes a common policy for overseas trade as well as for inter african trade and must preserve our right to trade freely anywhere he argued furthermore the pooled sum of our present individual investments in our similar national projects if used within an integrated plan would give greater benefit in mutual development indeed the total integration of the african economy on a continental scale is the only way in which the african states can achieve anything like the levels of the industrialized countries this economic union nkrumah reiterated some time afterwards to his peers meeting in addis ababa for the birth of the oau should involve a single african currency an african central bank and so on which would require an african confederal political structure but this did not take into account the indefatigable attachment of virtually all the african heads of state to a balkanised independence often masked by the evocation of a very vague gradualism the intangibility of the borders inherited from colonisation being erected at this occasion into a principle this was to underestimate their preference to return to the fold of the former colonial rulers nkrumah speech during the creation of the oau under the form of institutions of cooperation set up with the colonial metropolis during decolonisation for neo colonial domination thus although the idea of the african common market had seemed shared beyond the handful of states then deemed progressive the signatories to an oau charter intended to coordinate and intensify their cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for the peoples of africa only stated that the member states shall coordinate and harmonize their general policies especially in the following fields a political and diplomatic cooperation b economic cooperation including transport and communications the unity finally obtained by the supposed founding fathers of pan africanism was reduced essentially to coordination and consultation in fact despite the subsequent existence of certain sub regional institutions central african customs and economic union east african community the creation of the oau had mainly consecrated the construction of african nation states dependent in general on central capitalism or neo colonial neocolonised from the lagos plan to the afcfta a decade later in the 1970s confronted with the persistence of under development or the development of under development these african states after having vainly participated with the countries of latin america and asia around forty of them constituting the acp countries which had drawn up the so called lomé i convention with the eec in 1975 an extension of the euro african yaoundé ii convention pleading at the un from 1973 to 1976 in favour of a new international economic order returned to the pan africanist project the formulation of this was the lagos plan of action for the economic development of africa 1980 2000 adopted by the second extraordinary session of the oau conference of heads of state and government lagos april 28 29 1980 the latter having noted the failure of global development strategies and the inability of african states to point to any significant growth rate or satisfactory index of general well being in the past 20 years as well as the exploitation of africa by neo colonialist external forces which seek to influence the economic policies and directions of african states committed itself to promote the economic integration of the african region in order to facilitate and reinforce social and economic intercourse leading to the eventual establishment of an african common market leading to an african economic community but this sort of return to the idea rejected at the birth of the oau did not come at any propitious moment the failure of development correctly identified overlooks the share of responsibility borne by those who managed the african states mismanagement as a factor in the primitive accumulation of private capital and so on leading nearly all the over indebted african states from the 1980s onwards into reliance on the bretton woods institutions advocates of neoliberal structural adjustment programmes and the washington consensus in fact this amounted to a reorganisation of the dependency of the african states economies in respect to the traditional capitalist powers in the context of a neoliberal restructuring of capitalist globalisation accentuated in the following decade by the end of the so called communist bloc an updating of dependency rather than self dependence integration in the neoliberal phase of globalisation rather than the creation of an african economic community of a capitalist nature certainly all this leading to a stronger grip by the transnationals principally of western origin on the african economy through the dispossession of the strategic enterprises of the states a minority of native capitalists also profited from this often linked to or constituted by the leaders of the african states for the popular classes including the lower layers of the middle classes there was pauperisation the lagos plan was replaced in june 1991 by the treaty establishing the african economic community signed in abuja then the new nigerian capital by 51 oau states the so called abuja treaty still referred to the lagos plan and the integration of african economies while seeing state commercial companies as actors in intra african exchanges it established a schedule of transition to the said community over a maximum 34 years anticipated for 2025 and divided into six stages a maximum of 10 years was set for free trade zones in regional economic communities in southern central eastern northern and western africa however although accepting the capitalist paradigm for the states and the oau technocracy this did not represent a pure and simple alignment about neoliberal capitalist globalisation and the restructuring of imperialist domination for example the un economic commission for africa had in an evaluation of the implementation of this treaty noted this contradiction concerning the fixing of a rate of participation of national capital from 30 to 51 according to the regional community for all industrial enterprises in certain regional communities it is not possible to want to attract massive foreign investment and at the same time establish a sub regional market virtually closed to foreign investors obviously on this issue most of the sub regional communities have not adapted to the neo liberal economic spaces emerging in african states this showed a certain desire to limit in the name of a supposed nationalism or pan africanism the grip of the transnationals on africa s economies thus favouring the development of african capital or african fractions of the capitalist class the national bourgeoisies to which the political leaders and those around them belonged without really addressing the aggravation of poverty among the popular classes in the 1980s and 1990s the lagos plan and the abuja treaty were in the 1990s the main reference points for an african economic nationalism superficially denouncing the neo colonialism of neoliberal structural adjustment ten years after the adoption of the abuja treaty as the oau became the au 2000 2002 the organisation publicly assumed a neoliberal orientation adopting in 2001 the new partnership for africa s development nepad drawn up under the auspices of the presidents of senegal abdoulaye wade south africa thabo mbeki algeria abdel aziz bouteflika and nigeria olusegun obasanjo a development programme allegedly by africans and for africans but criticised by the nigerian activist moussa tchangari as firmly mired in neoliberal dogma because of its compliance with the spirt of the bretton woods institutions nepad and the abuja treaty formed the basis of the au s new pan africanist project agenda 2063 the africa we want of which the entry into force of the afcfta is a decisive stage it is in the dynamic of assumption of this neoliberal option of pan africanism that we should see the enthusiasm expressed by nigeria s mahamadou issoufou responsible for the coordination of the process of negotiation of the agreement rwanda s paul kagame president of the au when the agreement was submitted for signature the rwandan patriotic front led by kagame is the proprietor of the holding crystal ventures ltd the biggest private employer in the country with investments around the world the technocrats of the au and nearly all the pan african media the afcfta is an african version of the regional free trade agreements which have become fashionable whether already signed or under negotiation this expanded and secure market for the goods and services of state parties through adequate infrastructure and the reduction or progressive elimination of tariffs and elimination of non tariff barriers to trade and investment preamble to the agreement has as its reference point with the constitutive act of the au and the abuja treaty the marrakesh agreement which created the world trade organisation wto thus it promises generally the same effects as free trade processes elsewhere a minority of winners and many losers as the ugandan activist yash tandon has put it in the context of free trade trade is war a war where the winners are generally the same the capitalist economies which are already the most dynamic and who are often initiators of the current wave of free trade agreements thus the united nations conference on trade and development has drawn attention to the continued erosion of the margin of action of developing countries produced by regional and bilateral trade agreements above all in the less developed countries with africa accounting for 33 of the 47 countries thus classified around the world however even inside the economies considered as the most dynamic there are winners and losers from free trade as the partner states are supposed to negotiate on the basis of the competitive advantages of their respective economies the agreements also reflect the inequalities between sectors inside the national economies as regards international competitiveness so some local economic sectors are sacrificed generally to the benefit of the transnationals of local origin as are the popular classes thus the growth of free trade increases the re production and aggravation of inequalities and pauperisation this does not prevent these agreements adopting formulas to the contrary for some year women youth and extreme poverty have been at the centre of a supposed attention to social justice on the part of these international institutions an apparent concern for social justice that some have called social neoliberalism expression of a neoliberal heterodoxy in the text of the afcfta the promise is to promote and attain sustainable and inclusive socio economic development gender equality and the protocol on services promises to improve the social and economic wellbeing of the whole of the african people an authentic desire for inclusion is not apparent in the opacity which characterises the drawing up and negotiation of these free trade agreements excluding civil society social movements and indeed parliaments including in states which claim a long tradition of representative democracy which can be considered as a semi admission of the undemocratic objectives of the drafts under negotiation whereas agenda 2063 undertakes to put â mobilization of the people and their ownership of continental programmes at the core according to the african branch of the third world network there is little space in the structures involved with the cfta for participation by civil society groups or the private sector the only possibilities so far seem to be episodic consultations with these groups outside any of the negotiating structures in vain a pan african network of organisations of civil society has requested that a space is created at the national regional and continental level for african citizens and socio economic groups like workers farmers producers enterprises civil society the private sector and so on for an effective participation in a democratic and transparent process that all information linked to the cfta and the process of negotiation and implementation are available in a timely fashion so that all citizens can make their contributions at the national regional and continental level for in the absence of a democratic process one of the minimal conditions for democracy is the availability to citizens of information on the said project to allow debate prior to a referendum consultation but the attitude taken to the negotiation of the cfta is only logical with respect to the contempt for even minimal democracy shown by many states of the au the institutions of the latter being generally led by former actors and members of the clientele of these states bearers of a political culture hostile to democracy thus in senegal often presented as one of the emblems of democracy in africa the overwhelming majority 99 999 of the population is not aware of the issues around the cfta even the intellectuals are not aware says economist ndongo samba sylla

dubai pakistan was facing myriad challenges when the charismatic imran khan took over as prime minister of the country in august 2018 fight against corruption and corrupt politicians hardline religious groups dwindling economy and a face off with united states president donald trump on the issue of war against terrorism were some of the major issues facing imran who rolled up his sleeves to put up a brave face and tackle them head on and to be fair so far he has done quite well in at least taking the right direction in a bid to handle these issues in the first five months of his government one of his biggest achievements has been in improving ties with the gulf countries especially saudi arabia and the uae by making his first official visits to these countries he made the right choice by asking these countries for financial assistance to bring pakistan out of its current economic crisis both saudi arabia and the uae also responded to his call and provided necessary financial assistance imran s campaign to eliminate corruption is right on track though it is a bit selective because it is mostly focused on his political rivals he has made considerable progress in bringing change in the country in line with his vision of a naya pakistan new pakistan but he is finding it tough to move forward with a number of socio economic issues due to lack of coordination across his inexperienced team the government is still stuck with the economy avoiding bold steps said dawood mamoon the director of research at the islamabad based policy research institute of market economy prime in a recent statement they are fire fighting at the moment mamoon added according to a review published by prime on the completion of 100 days of the government imran s administration has completed 43 per cent of its set tasks almost half of those being in the creation of task forces or staff appointments according to the government website nonetheless the government is still in disarray with multiple ministries unable to implement decisions what are the challenges 1 economy overcoming the limitations of a dwindling economy and checking the massive devaluation of the rupee are the top challenges facing imran in 2019 pakistan is already negotiating with the international monetary fund imf to bridge the 12 billion dh44 13 billion financing gap for the current financial year it has adopted a two pronged strategy by reaching out to friendly countries and also knocking on the doors of the imf both saudi arabia and the uae have pledged to give 3 billion each to pakistan to help the country which is on the verge of a balance of payments crisis the budget deficit has grown steadily over the past five years and foreign currency reserves have declined the rupee has been repeatedly devalued fuelling inflation he needs to adopt confidence building measures to attract investment both from foreign companies as well as overseas pakistanis 2 foreign policy pakistan is facing a gigantic task of improving relations with its neighbours including india afghanistan iran and the gulf countries unlike the past imran and the army chief are now on the same page on foreign policy issues imran surprised the world when he offered dialogue with india to make peace and to open trade routes during his acceptance speech as the new prime minister opening of the kartarpur corridor between india and pakistan is certainly a remarkable development to embark upon a possible new journey to promote peace through dialogue imran and pakistan s armed forces yet again proved that they were working in tandem when they responded to trump s call to islamabad to help washington hold peace talks with taliban the move helped ease tensions between the us and pakistan in 2019 imran will have to focus deeply on the plan to ensure peace in afghanistan as it will help stabilise pakistan s economy and take measures to bring india to the dialogue table 3 extremism and internal security since imran took oath the security situation has improved across pakistan mainly due to massive crackdown on militant groups armed forces have managed to flush out terrorists from large parts of the country but there is a lot more that needs to be done to eliminate sleeping cells of terror groups imran faces a herculean task to reign in extremist groups seen as the biggest internal security threat to the country though imran handled well the uprising of the extremist religious groups that staged protests over the release of asia bibi in a blasphemy case he has a long way to go to eliminate extremism from pakistani society it is one of the most difficult tasks for him in 2019 investors will never come to the country unless the law and order situation improves and unless they are guaranteed protection of their lives and property 4 population growth the population bomb has exploded in pakistan as the country s population has grown five fold since 1960 to touch approximately 220 million this is a huge burden on natural resources including agriculture with its limited family planning measures pakistan has one of the highest birth rates in asia around three children per woman according to the world bank and figures provided by the pakistan government the baby boom is negating hard won economic and social progress 220 m pakistan s population which has grown five fold since 1960 5 water and power shortages according to reports pakistan is on the verge of an ecological disaster if authorities do not urgently address looming water shortages official estimates show that by 2025 the country will be facing an absolute scarcity of water with less than 500 cubic metres available per person just one third of the water available in parched somalia according to the united nations
news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by zimbabwe s exports have been on a steady growth path throughout the year but imports rose at a much even faster pace in this piece newsday s mthandazo nyoni looks at how the country has fared in the just ended year according to the zimbabwe national statistics agency zimstat zimbabwe recorded a trade deficit of 1 978 billion between february and october 2018 up 34 compared to the same period in 2017 the country imported goods and services worth 5 189 billion an increase of 27 against exports of 3 211 billion in 2017 imports were 4 083 billion against exports of 2 611 billion january 2018 trade figures are still not available with zimstat saying that the zimbabwe revenue authority the source of merchandise trade data did not provide the information the bulk of the country s exports comprise among others gold flue cured tobacco ferrochrome nickel chrome and diamonds while imports were made up of fuel electricity maize medicines and vehicles the largest foreign currency earners were gold 1 030 billion followed by tobacco 492 million nickel mattes 432 million nickel ores and concentrates 322 million ferro chromium 207 million chromium ores and concentrates 81 million as of october 2018 the top five import drivers in the period between february and october were ranked as diesel which guzzled 817 million followed by unleaded petrol 398 million electricity 145 million crude soya bean oil 103 million and durum wheat 88 million zimbabwe s exports according to finance minister mthuli ncube are largely uncompetitive due to cost and production inefficiencies in addition our reliance on primary commodity exports means less value compared to high value processed goods the import bill has been dominated by a wide range of imports some of which are not critical or strategic he said gift mugano an expert in trade and international finance is also of the view that zimbabwe s exports are constrained by a variety of factors including poor competitiveness of local goods in international markets due to the strengthening of the united states dollar against regional currencies it is a plethora of issues high transactional costs for imports and exports low foreign direct investments high cost of compliance due to over regulation and excessive penalties there is high manufacturing base namely high costs of utilities limited access to trade financing and export incentives non vibrant domestic economy inadequate institutional and strategic support directed at trade development inability by firms to meet standards in export markets vulnerability to shocks associated with dependence on global markets particularly on south african economy illegal sanctions and withdrawal of preferences in key markets we have lack of access to information on available markets high country risk and demand for cash upfront payment by suppliers for raw materials and old equipment and poor firm capitalisation levels as well as policy inconsistencies he said economist and financial analyst persistence gwanyanya contends that government needs to work hard to correct trade imbalances brought partially by the failure to contain expenditure there is an expectation with government that this year it s not going to be very good in terms of the trade deficit the reason being that we are importing far more than we are generating foreign currency gwanyanya said you will find that in terms of export performance we have done far much better we have even exceeded our projections in the greater part of the year and also in terms of the remittances but the problem was mainly on the import side meaning that our challenge is mainly on the expenditure side we are failing to contain our imports as a country we have always been exceeding our target in respect to the imports which largely speaks to the import dependent nature of the country we depend largely on imported products and even including the raw materials he said gwanyanya pointed out that high imports were reflective of the de industrialisation challenge the economy was facing adding it was not going to be easy to contain imports within a short space of time we know at government level the thrust is to contain government expenditure through austerity measures which will translate into reduction of imports it s not a one day job that s why even in terms of projections we expecting to end the year at 11 7 in terms of budget deficit he said we are not tracking very well in terms of the total projected out turn for this year this simply reflects the import dependent nature of the economy but you may want to know that despite this the external position has remained well managed compared to the internal position the external position being the trade deficit the trend according to analysts would continue unless government implements its austerity measures as expounded in the 2019 national budget statement going into 2019 we expect the situation to be managed down that is if only the austerity measures are going to be effective because there is a strong link between what is happening between domestically that is on the budget deficit and the final outturn on the trade deficit gwanyanya said if we manage the budget deficit very well like we said it will go down from the current 11 7 to 5 we expect that to translate also into a reduction in the trade deficit but much will depend on the availability of foreign currency which availability in terms of exports like this year we expect exports and remittances to be at around 7 billion he said gwanyanya said the country had already recorded 6 billion in terms of forex income including remittances so far and was expecting to close the year at 7 billion meaning that there is good performance on the export sector and on the remittances and so we expect more foreign currency to flow into the country if more foreign currency flows into the country against a backdrop for internal position which is budget deficit which is not well managed it is going into translate into a widening trade deficit he said but we expect now that if the austerity measures are going to yield the results we expect that to translate into a further reduction in the trade deficit which is already decreasing but still remains high despite the decrease because we should always remember that we are in a dollarised economy the ideal situation will be to maintain some measure of balance between the inflows and outflows so as to reduce dependence on borrowing the deficit is however expected to widen in 2018 as the country absorbs more imports particularly raw materials that are needed as feedstock for the expanding economy and equipment to improve on competitiveness according to the central bank s latest monetary policy statement economic commentator reginald shoko weighed in saying the country would experience a trade deficit for the coming years due to number of issues ranging from the production capacity uncompetitive products emanating from high costs of production which is related to the prevailing monetary crisis around the exchange rate between the greenback and the bond shoko said the situation will only improve when our industry starts ticking as for now we shall continue as net importer even of products we have a comparative advantage to manufacture we also need to urge the local consumer to support local industry by buying local this will reduce the deficit but not real significant but it s a starting point at this point internal evaluation is no longer an option but a must in order to solve trade imbalances he said going forward it will be critical for government to address the current account deficit by supporting export oriented production like horticulture strategically manage available foreign currency by prioritising import substitution production for instance retooling and raw materials authorities also need to take decisive action on the revival of strategic state owned enterprises such as ziscosteel and cold storage commission which will improve manufacturing capacity to boost exports while limiting on import demand
by prof arvind sahay and sudheesh nambiath the year 2018 started with positive sentiment with global investor wealth at a little more than 87 trillion at end january 2018 and even gold prices were trading firm however over the year equity investors globally have lost approximately 15 trillion from that peak as the year has eroded this magnitude of paper wealth investors have started to explore other assets the citi macro risk index which measures the risk aversion is at 0 85 showing the level of risk aversion is above the average level of 0 5 measured between zero to one last time it was these levels in 2015 and 2008 although it touched peak at 2011 the year to date returns of global equity benchmarks on currency adjusted basis have turned to be deep in red across majority of the countries due to a combination of geo political economic and technological transformation reasons geopolitically there is increased uncertainty about the unpredictability of american policy the uncertainty of what will happen with brexit and the indian elections coming up in h1 of 2019 which is now going to be a lot closer than earlier thought economically there are very large problems in argentina venezuela and turkey and managed funds are pulling funds out from emerging and developing countries on account of increase in interest rates by us fed there are concerns about debt becoming unsustainable in china during this time the fed had increased rates for four consecutive session in 2018 making it the ninth rate rise since the fed began to reverse from its near zero interest rate policy also read share market live updates sensex turns choppy down 70 points nifty below 10 850 bharti airtel up 1 5 the dow jones transportation index considered a barometer of economic activity has fallen by 14 during 2018 the baltic dry index on the other hand is at 1000 in december 2018 about the same that it was in january 2018 this is would mean that world merchandise trade is in good nick despite the rhetoric of trade wars between china and the us the pe ratio of s p 500 has drifted to long term average however there is a note of caution schiler s cyclically adjusted pe ratio inflation adjusted has started showing descent recently indicating that it may be safe to view this as a mean reversion and could see diversion of funds back to equity from cash or safe haven assets so where does this put gold on the horizon of investors and bankers some central banks have been increasing their holding of gold primarily russia and china but also the ecb and the reserve bank of india demand from china and india continues to be strong gold has given positive returns on a non dollar denominated currency evidently due to currency depreciation although in dollar terms it has declined approximately 2 while the world witnessed a rout in global equity markets gold etf investment hit a five year high in may but then declined steadily till early october similarly managed money positions in comex noticed net short position build toward last week of september as price declined nevertheless post that there has been addition to etfs and physical gold prices have recovered from the bottom by nearly 100 as we write this at the end of 2018 the risks going to next year we think are more controlled and we don t fear the r word as the stimulus to the us economy from the tax cuts peters out and the effects of raised tariffs start to kick in in the us growth in the us will slow china is also slowing with fears of a negative fallouts of the very large debt positions how us fed reacts to the situation of an inverted yield curve as noticed since last five trading days indicating fed may be dovish going to 2019 another reason we think president trump may not fire the fed chairman that said the difference between one year and 3 year treasury yield is something to watch for this would mean dollar could be turning lower and drive gold prices higher within india with the general elections coming and that seems to be indicating no full majority for the ruling party uncertainty will rise assuming customs duty remains same and the rupee remains in the range of rs 70 to 75 per us dollar we think that gold price in india would be in range of rs 30 400 to rs 34 900 for 2019 if customs duty were to drop to a range that makes smuggling uneconomic we think then that the prices of gold would likely be more subdued this article is authored by prof arvind sahay iima and sudheesh nambiath india gold policy centre at iima views expressed in the article are authors own
cameroonian separatists fighting for the independence of the self declared state of ambazonia have put their own cryptocurrency on sale to the general public the ambacoin aims to provide humanitarian relief to those affected by the conflict in the anglophone regions with the hope of raising up to 250 million us dollars advertising read more the initiative is geared towards helping with humanitarian side of things says frank one of the members of the ambacoin project who responded to press enquiries about the cryptocurrency but wanted to remain anonymous that s the idea behind it to raise funds to support humanitarian efforts it is hoped that the creation of a currency for so called ambazonia will also support efforts to have the breakaway state officially recognised as a country creating their own ambazonian currency enables the separatists to move away from using the cfa franc the idea of ambacoin was to get away from the cfa we don t see the cfa franc as a legitimate currency for ambazonia says frank if we want to be independent we can t pursue a french colonial currency cameroon s currency is issued by the bank of the central african states which is in turn backed by the french government s treasury the cfa franc is pegged to the euro however and it has drawn the ire of activists in west and central african countries in recent years who have protested france s continuing influence long after the end of colonialism how does it work ambacoin officially went on sale on 28 december with one ambacoin token equivalent to 25 us cents before the main crowdsale the token was offered through a presale with 10 percent of the ambacoins available more than 30 000 ambacoins had been issued as of 1 january according to the website there are 13 holders of ambacoin according to an analysis available on the bloxy website which provides information on public blockchains one digital wallet address holds almost 42 per cent of the existing ambacoins issued

cryptocurrency digital wallets the dashboard for purchasing ambacoins photo ambacoin the token itself is built upon existing ethereum blockchain technology providing a decentralised public ledger ambacoin s whitepaper describes how transactions are completed using ethereum s system of smart contracts a protocol aiming to enforce transactions without a third party ambacoin is based on the proof of stake architecture defining how block transactions are dealt with this approach avoids the need for mining where computing power is used to run different cryptographic calculations how can ambacoin be used the project envisages a number of uses for ambacoin the whitepaper describes how supporters can hold onto the token and watch its value appreciate over time a strategy popularised by bitcoin enthusiasts where to hodl is to hold onto cryptocurrency rather than sell it furthermore ambacoin can be traded to provide a return for investors according to the project it also acts as a digitised form of a treasury bill eventually the ambazonian nation will purchase it and it can be used to get access to national services according to the whitepaper the ambacoin will not be pegged to any particular traditional currency and it aims to become particularly important for remittances from africans in the diaspora spending on potential humanitarian relief for the anglophone regions will be decided by ambacoin s board of directors according to frank they will make that decision he says drawing particular attention to the plight of refugees and internally displaced people who have been hit by the worsening violence in cameroon s anglophone regions the crisis that hit the north west and south west regions has already seen humanitarian fundraising efforts the cameroonian government in mid 2018 raised almost 20 million euros to help people hit by the fallout of what it says are acts of terrorism carried out by separatist groups support from ambazonian government a number of different groups purporting to be the government of ambazonia have emerged since the self declaration of independence for ambazonia in october 2017 the situation on the ground has also evolved with rival separatist armed groups involved in fighting between themselves as well as with the cameroonian security forces an illustration of an ambacoin photo ambacoin it s an initiative of a few

declared territory to issue its own currency somaliland which declared independence after the fall of military leader siad barre in 1991 issues the somaliland shilling and operates its own central

the african continent s youngest country other countries outside of the african continent have been involved in cryptocurrency initiatives venezuela s government launched the petro in early 2018 with president nicolas maduro describing it as the cornerstone of efforts to rebuild the country the petro is said to be backed by oil reserves but investigations have revealed scant details on the cryptocurrency the marshall islands is also reportedly launching a cryptocurrency in partnership with an israeli firm however the international monetary fund in a september 2018 report says that there are many risks involved in issuing a cryptocurrency as legal tender supporters of ambazonia such as frank see little downside in issuing ambacoins for the breakaway state we believe the closer ambazonia gets to being an independent nation it will affect the value of the coin he says people are getting to know cryptocurrency the more it gets known the more stable it becomes says frank the

the main concern for many people encountered on my festive season break in the israeli red sea resort of eilat was the direction of equity prices in 2019 this i suggested is largely going to depend on what happens on wall street the rise of asian finance may be the great economic development of the 21st century but when it comes to share prices the dow jones and s p 500 still outrank anything that goes on in beijing hong kong or tokyo squabbles between donald trump and a democrat controlled house of representatives that already have shut down the federal government britain in spite of being a global leader in finance still follows wall street after the recent severe market correction the dominant issue for wall street will be the tussle between the white house and the us central bank the federal reserve this will be closely followed by us china trade relations the mounting disaffection with the faang companies facebook amazon apple netflix and google and squabbles between donald trump and a democrat controlled house of representatives that already have shut down the federal government when donald trump replaced the highly respected economist janet yellen with jay powell at the federal reserve he thought he was getting an upgrade but whereas yellen was flexible slowing credit tightening when beijing markets wobbled in the first half of 2017 powell is more of a conventional republican the former investment banker is dare one say it a herbert hoover republican pressing on with tightening irrespective of general economic conditions us rates were raised a notch in december in spite of calamitous falls on wall street and now stand at 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent powell has signalled more to come the american labour market is tight according to the federal reserve bank of st louis s employment cost index wages and salaries for private industry are up 3 per cent from a year earlier the fastest growth since early 2008 accelerating labour costs can be a precursor to rising inflation calling for more fed tightening in contrast the yield curve is now relatively flat meaning that long term interest rates are close to short term interest rates the new year has started on a better note on this front with trump declaring big progress after a weekend chat with president xi jinping short term rates could rise above long term rates if the fed keeps tightening which is often seen as a precursor to recession moreover while it is common for white house politics and the fed to be on a collision course never has the dispute been as loud as it has on the trump megaphone that as much as rising interest rates raised the temperature and contributed to wall street s 9 7 per cent wobble in 2018 if the fed sticks with its tightening in the face of the us domestic and international runes it could all become very bloody closely behind in terms of market shocks are sino american relations trump s tough approach to china trade is justified beijing has received a free ride since joining the world trade organisation in 2001 it protected itself with high tariffs and building a manufacturing powerhouse that sucks jobs and technology out of the west but trump s sledgehammer approach to reining in china s economic imperialism and preference for unilateral action continue to unsettle markets fearing an even broader trade war between the world s most powerful economies the new year has started on a better note on this front with trump declaring big progress after a weekend chat with president xi jinping that could augur a less disruptive policy a major factor in the 2018 pullback for stocks was dissatisfaction with silicon valley bullies facebook s misuse of data and arrogance together with its ageing advertising audience have removed lustre apple s luxury ambitions hit a ceiling with the 1 000 785 iphone xs amazon s imperialism it is expanding its whole foods outlets to integrate them more with its delivery services is in danger of attracting the trust busters in the same way it has become a target for tax collectors all of these factors have cast a pall over a tech sector that could do no wrong this year starts with a us government shutdown as a result of stalemate between trump and congress over his request to spend 5bn 0 125 per cent of total government spending on a wall with mexico traditionally such rows are about the us budget deficit rather than politics this one is significant for wall street and global markets in that it signals a level of political dissonance with a capacity to undermine output and jobs
inflationary pressures continued to be elevated in sierra leone since the last monetary policy statement the governor of the bank of sierra leone professor kelfala kalllon said today the governor said that headline inflation increased from 16 59 percent in june 2018 to 19 29 percent in october 2018 this development the governor indicated resulted primarily from an increase in food prices which was compounded by a depreciation of the leone and an upward adjustment in the domestic pump price of fuel the governor stated however the mpc noted that although the inflation rate remains high there are signs that inflationary pressures are easing as evidenced by a decrease in the inflation rate to 18 14 percent in november 2018 the stability in the exchange value of the leone against major currencies and an improved domestic food supply as we enter the harvest season monetary policy statement __________ the monetary policy committee mpc of the bank of sierra leone bsl met on friday 28th december 2018 under the chairmanship of the governor professor kelfala morana kallon based on an assessment of international and domestic economic developments and their potential impact on the outlook for inflation in sierra leone the mpc decided to maintain the monetary policy rate mpr at 16 50 percent the factors that informed this decision are discussed in the rest of this statement on the domestic front real gdp growth is expected to drop to 3 7 percent in 2018 from the 3 8 percent recorded in 2017 this reflects the continued suspension of iron ore mining which continues to weigh down on economic activity coupled with subdued aggregate demand since the last mpc inflationary pressures continued to be elevated with headline inflation increasing from 16 59 percent in june 2018 to 19 29 percent in october 2018 this development resulted primarily from an increase in food prices which was compounded by a depreciation of the leone and an upward adjustment in the domestic pump price of fuel however the mpc noted that although the inflation rate remains high there are signs that inflationary pressures are easing as evidenced by a decrease in the inflation rate to 18 14 percent in november 2018 the stability in the exchange value of the leone against major currencies and an improved domestic food supply as we enter the harvest season on the money supply front the broad money stock expanded by 2 53 percent in q3 2018 compared to the contraction of 0 25 percent recorded in q2 2018 this was largely explained by growth in net foreign assets and credit to the private sector reflecting the government s fiscal consolidation efforts net government domestic borrowing declined by 1 93 percent in this regard the expenditure control measures recently announced by government in the 2019 budget which should reduce government borrowing and bring fiscal operations back to a sustainable path represent a major step in restoring conditions for macroeconomic stability the money market remained tight with some banks resorting to the collateralized discount window at the bank of sierra leone the tight liquidity condition in the money market caused the interbank rate to rise to 14 76 percent in q3 2018 from 13 66 percent in q2 2018 however the mpc noted that liquidity conditions slightly improved in october and november 2018 following net injections from government to finance infrastructure projects the mpc was also encouraged by the fact that growth in bank credit to the private sector recovered strongly rising from 6 60 percent in q2 2018 to 17 65 percent in q3 2018 consequently the yield across all tenors of government securities increased during the quarter however government s fiscal consolidation efforts which should lower its demand for loanable funds are expected to lower those yields this expected reduction in the government s appetite for loanable funds should provide incentives to the commercial banks and other financial institutions to increase private sector lending regarding the exchange rate the mpc notes that the leone appreciated against the dollar slightly during q3 2018 more significantly its exchange value in terms of major currencies remained relatively stable during much of q4 2018 this was mainly due to subdued demand for foreign exchange as a result of tight monetary conditions and the injection of foreign exchange by our development partners this development which the mpc expects to continue in the near future should dampen inflationary pressures especially through the exchange rate effect on the pump price of fuel the banking sector remained sound well capitalized and profitable however though on declining trajectory the non performing loans ratio remain slightly above 10 percent which is mildly worrisome global growth is expected to be firm driven by strong growth in the united states and developing economies and is projected to grow by 3 7 percent in 2018 and 2019 however the escalating trade frictions among major economies and the uncertainties surrounding brexit could undermine the growth momentum real gdp growth is expected to pick up to 5 1 percent in 2019 supported by the resumption of iron ore production and exports improved foreign direct investments in the agriculture and tourism sectors public investments in infrastructure supported by policy reforms the mpc however recognizes that continued economic recovery over the medium to long term horizon depends on sustained macroeconomic stability and addressing underlying structural constraints especially on the supply side on the inflation front recent data confirm an emerging disinflationary trend therefore the policy priority for the bsl in the coming months is to maintain that disinflationary momentum while allowing scope for a recovery of aggregate demand to push real gdp back towards its potential growth rate based on the near term outlook the balance of risks as well as the need to await the impact of recent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms measures in the economy the mpc resolved to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged hence effective monday december 31 2018 the following rates are published for the information of the public monetary policy rate is 16 5 percent standing deposit facility rate is 13 5 percent standing lending facility rate is 20 5 percent

alex brummer the dominant issue for wall street in 2019 will be the tussle between the white house and the us federal reserve the main concern for many people encountered on my festive season break in the israeli red sea resort of eilat was the direction of equity prices in 2019 this i suggested is largely going to depend on what happens on wall street the rise of asian finance may be the great economic development of the 21st century but when it comes to share prices the dow jones and s p 500 still outrank anything that goes on in beijing hong kong or tokyo britain in spite of being a global leader in finance still follows wall street after the recent severe market correction the dominant issue for wall street will be the tussle between the white house and the us central bank the federal reserve this will be closely followed by us china trade relations the mounting disaffection with the faang companies facebook amazon apple netflix and google and squabbles between donald trump and a democrat controlled house of representatives that already have shut down the federal government when donald trump replaced the highly respected economist janet yellen with jay powell at the federal reserve he thought he was getting an upgrade but whereas yellen was flexible slowing credit tightening when beijing markets wobbled in the first half of 2017 powell is more of a conventional republican the former investment banker is dare one say it a herbert hoover republican pressing on with tightening irrespective of general economic conditions us rates were raised a notch in december in spite of calamitous falls on wall street and now stand at 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent powell has signalled more to come the american labour market is tight according to the federal reserve bank of st louis s employment cost index wages and salaries for private industry are up 3 per cent from a year earlier the fastest growth since early 2008 accelerating labour costs can be a precursor to rising inflation calling for more fed tightening in contrast the yield curve is now relatively flat meaning that long term interest rates are close to short term interest rates the new year has started on a better note on this front with trump declaring big progress after a weekend chat with president xi jinping short term rates could rise above long term rates if the fed keeps tightening which is often seen as a precursor to recession moreover while it is common for white house politics and the fed to be on a collision course never has the dispute been as loud as it has on the trump megaphone that as much as rising interest rates raised the temperature and contributed to wall street s 9 7 per cent wobble in 2018 if the fed sticks with its tightening in the face of the us domestic and international runes it could all become very bloody closely behind in terms of market shocks are sino american relations trump s tough approach to china trade is justified beijing has received a free ride since joining the world trade organisation in 2001 it protected itself with high tariffs and building a manufacturing powerhouse that sucks jobs and technology out of the west but trump s sledgehammer approach to reining in china s economic imperialism and preference for unilateral action continue to unsettle markets fearing an even broader trade war between the world s most powerful economies the new year has started on a better note on this front with trump declaring big progress after a weekend chat with president xi jinping that could augur a less disruptive policy a major factor in the 2018 pullback for stocks was dissatisfaction with silicon valley bullies facebook s misuse of data and arrogance together with its ageing advertising audience have removed lustre apple s luxury ambitions hit a ceiling with the 1 000 785 iphone xs amazon s imperialism it is expanding its whole foods outlets to integrate them more with its delivery services is in danger of attracting the trust busters in the same way it has become a target for tax collectors all of these factors have cast a pall over a tech sector that could do no wrong this year starts with a us government shutdown as a result of stalemate between trump and congress over his request to spend 5bn 0 125 per cent of total government spending on a wall with mexico traditionally such rows are about the us budget deficit rather than politics this one is significant for wall street and global markets in that it signals a level of political dissonance with a capacity to undermine output and jobs
listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element in 1991 mauricio macri son of a wealthy industrialist was kidnapped his captors bundled him into a coffin drove to a hideout and held him for two weeks before his family paid a 6m ransom mr macri argentina s president since 2015 says the ordeal persuaded him to abandon business and contribute to society by taking up politics his second career has proved hardly less traumatic argentina s plunging currency led mr macri to confess on september 3rd that these were the worst five months of my life since my kidnapping another recession the second since mr macri took office now seems inevitable in may the central bank raised interest rates to 40 to tackle a currency crisis that has seen the peso lose more than half its value against the dollar since the start of the year the next month the government secured a 50bn credit line from the imf the largest in the fund s history in august as the peso continued its slump the central bank raised rates to 60 none of these measures bought more than temporary relief mr macri has appealed to the imf to accelerate the loan payments a new round of negotiations with the fund began on september 4th and have yet to conclude with a presidential election due in october 2019 investors fear that the crisis will precipitate mr macri s departure and a return to the disastrous populist policies of his peronist predecessor cristina fernández de kirchner mr macri is entitled to feel dizzied by his fall from grace until recently he appeared assured of a second term in office as reward for his efforts to repair the economic damage inflicted by ms fernández soon after taking office his government slashed export taxes lifted currency controls and resolved a disagreement with bondholders to restore access to international capital spending cuts were implemented gradually to protect the third of argentines below the poverty line the strategy worked there was a painful recession in 2016 the result of raising interest rates to tackle 25 inflation but after that the economy rebounded in 2017 gdp grew by 2 9 mr macri s coalition won mid term congressional elections in october yet despite his efforts to defuse it the fiscal time bomb bequeathed by ms fernández has detonated this year in april rising yields on us treasury bonds hit latin american currencies as investors sold risky assets argentina s fiscal and current account deficits along with its pile of foreign denominated debt singled it out for punishment the peso slumped along with approval of mr macri see chart in response the government announced its latest plan to regain the confidence of investors on september 3rd it has promised to balance the budget in 2019 a year sooner than agreed on in june with the imf it plans to eliminate the primary fiscal deficit which is forecast to reach 2 6 of gdp this year by levying a new tax on exports and reducing subsidies on public transport and electricity as well as appeasing investors the measures are aimed at persuading the imf to disburse credit earmarked for 2020 and 2021 but the fund may seek modifications in return for more financing says edward glossop of capital economics a consultancy the crisis inflicts on mr macri both a political as well as an economic headache the new spending cuts require the approval of congress where his coalition is in a minority he will need the support of moderate peronists in both houses to vote in october and november to pass the 2019 budget most seem willing to lend their support the moderates would have nothing to gain from provoking a political crisis even if that succeeds however the coming months are unlikely to offer mr macri respite the government expects the economy to shrink by 2 4 this year and inflation to reach 42 next year it predicts a further contraction of 0 5 and inflation averaging 23 with interest rates set to remain at 60 until at least december output could fall even more than forecast a worsening economy may prompt social unrest the general confederation of labour argentina s largest trade union group has called a general strike for september 25th in protest at the government s austerity measures it may prove the first of many much depends on how much patience argentines are willing to show the government says juan cruz díaz of cefeidas group a consultancy mr macri can take some comfort from the travails of his predecessor ms fernández was elected to the senate last year but faces a number of serious corruption charges related to her time in office she is likely to seek the presidency again next year unless congress votes to strip her of the parliamentary privileges which currently preclude her arrest her return might suit mr macri although she retains a loyal band of supporters polls suggest that two thirds of argentines dislike her making her re election far fetched her candidacy would probably take votes from a moderate more appealing peronist candidate a more electable peronist would offer mr macri a sterner test but the party has yet to coalesce around anyone there is still time néstor kirchner ms fernández s late husband and presidential predecessor emerged as a competitive candidate only a few months before his election in 2003 should mr macri s ratings continue to decline he could decide to stand down to make room for one of his protégés perhaps maría eugenia vidal the charismatic governor of buenos aires province or horacio rodríguez larreta the mayor of buenos aires aides to mr macri discount that prospect but as mr macri knows his career can change course suddenly

zimbabwe s exports have been on a steady growth path throughout the year but imports rose at a much even faster pace in this piece newsday s mthandazo nyoni looks at how the country has fared in the just ended year zimbabwe s exports have been on a steady growth path throughout the year but imports rose at a much even faster pace in this piece newsday s mthandazo nyoni looks at how the country has fared in the just ended year according to the zimbabwe national statistics agency zimstat zimbabwe recorded a trade deficit of 1 978 billion between february and october 2018 up 34 compared to the same period in 2017 the country imported goods and services worth 5 189 billion an increase of 27 against exports of 3 211 billion in 2017 imports were 4 083 billion against exports of 2 611 billion january 2018 trade figures are still not available with zimstat saying that the zimbabwe revenue authority the source of merchandise trade data did not provide the information the bulk of the country s exports comprise among others gold flue cured tobacco ferrochrome nickel chrome and diamonds while imports were made up of fuel electricity maize medicines and vehicles the largest foreign currency earners were gold 1 030 billion followed by tobacco 492 million nickel mattes 432 million nickel ores and concentrates 322 million ferro chromium 207 million chromium ores and concentrates 81 million

million crude soya bean oil 103 million and durum wheat 88 million zimbabwe s exports according to finance minister mthuli ncube are largely uncompetitive due to cost and production inefficiencies in addition our reliance on primary commodity exports means less value compared to high value processed goods the import bill has been dominated by a wide range of imports some of which are not critical or strategic he said gift mugano an expert in trade and international finance is also of the view that zimbabwe s exports are constrained by a variety of factors including poor competitiveness of local goods in international markets due to the strengthening of the united states dollar against regional currencies it is a plethora of issues high transactional costs for imports and exports low foreign direct investments high cost of compliance due to over regulation and excessive penalties there is high manufacturing base namely high costs of utilities limited access to trade financing and export incentives non vibrant domestic economy inadequate institutional and strategic support directed at trade development inability by firms to meet standards in export markets vulnerability to shocks associated with dependence on global markets particularly on south african economy illegal sanctions and withdrawal of preferences in key markets we have lack of access to information on available markets high country risk and demand for cash upfront payment by suppliers for raw materials and old equipment and poor firm capitalisation levels as well as policy inconsistencies he said economist and financial analyst persistence gwanyanya contends that government needs to work hard to correct trade imbalances brought partially by the failure to contain expenditure there is an expectation with government that this year it s not going to be very good in terms of the trade deficit the reason being that we are importing far more than we are generating foreign currency gwanyanya said you will find that in terms of export performance we have done far much better we have even exceeded our projections in the greater part of the year and also in terms of the remittances but the problem was mainly on the import side meaning that our challenge is mainly on the expenditure side we are failing to contain our imports as a country we have always been exceeding our target in respect to the imports which largely speaks to the import dependent nature of the country we depend largely on imported products and even including the raw materials he said gwanyanya pointed out that high imports were reflective of the de industrialisation challenge the economy was facing adding it was not going to be easy to contain imports within a short space of time we know at government level the thrust is to contain government expenditure through austerity measures which will translate into reduction of imports it s not a one day job that s why even in terms of projections we expecting to end the year at 11 7 in terms of budget deficit he said we are not tracking very well in terms of the total projected out turn for this year this simply reflects the import dependent nature of the economy but you may want to know that despite this the external position has remained well managed compared to the internal position the external position being the trade deficit the trend according to analysts would continue unless government implements its austerity measures as expounded in the 2019 national budget statement going into 2019 we expect the situation to be managed down that is if only the austerity measures are going to be effective because there is a strong link between what is happening between domestically that is on the budget deficit and the final outturn on the trade deficit gwanyanya said if we manage the budget deficit very well like we said it will go down from the current 11 7 to 5 we expect that to translate also into a reduction in the trade deficit but much will depend on the availability of foreign currency which availability in terms of exports like this year we expect exports and remittances to be at around 7 billion he said gwanyanya said the country had already recorded 6 billion in terms of forex income including remittances so far and was expecting to close the year at 7 billion meaning that there is good performance on the export sector and on the remittances and so we expect more foreign currency to flow into the country if more foreign currency flows into the country against a backdrop for internal position which is budget deficit which is not well managed it is going into translate into a widening trade deficit he said but we expect now that if the austerity measures are going to yield the results we expect that to translate into a further reduction in the trade deficit which is already decreasing but still remains high despite the decrease because we should always remember that we are in a dollarised economy the ideal situation will be to maintain some measure of balance between the inflows and outflows so as to reduce dependence on borrowing the deficit is however expected to widen in 2018 as the country absorbs more imports particularly raw materials that are needed as feedstock for the expanding economy and equipment to improve on competitiveness according to the central bank s latest monetary policy statement economic commentator reginald shoko weighed in saying the country would experience a trade deficit for the coming years due to number of issues ranging from the production capacity uncompetitive products emanating from high costs of production which is related to the prevailing monetary crisis around the exchange rate between the greenback and the bond shoko said the situation will only improve when our industry starts ticking as for now we shall continue as net importer even of products we have a comparative advantage to manufacture we also need to urge the local consumer to support local industry by buying local this will reduce the deficit but not real significant but it s a starting point at this point internal evaluation is no longer an option but a must in order to solve trade imbalances he said going forward it will be critical for government to address the current account deficit by supporting export oriented production like horticulture strategically manage available foreign currency by prioritising import substitution production for instance retooling and raw materials authorities also need to take decisive action on the revival of strategic state owned enterprises such as ziscosteel and cold storage commission which will improve manufacturing capacity to boost exports while limiting on import demand
in kigali rwanda on march 21 2018 five years after the 50th anniversary of the creation of the organisation of african unity oau african union au considered in the newspeak of the au as fifty years of success 44 of the au s 55 member states signed the agreement concerning the creation of the african continental free trade area afcfta a single continental market for goods and services with free movement of business persons and investments suppression of customs tariffs is supposed to boost intra african trade which represents around 12 15 of africa s exchanges well below the internal exchanges of other continents which makes africa the most open region to world trade in the event of ratification by 22 of the signatory states by late 2018 early 2019 intra african trade is slated to exceed 50 by 2022 it is a major stage in the process of african integration which should culminate in the african economic community aec the objective of the au programme for the following half century entitled agenda 2063 the africa we want or an integrated prosperous and peaceful africa driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the international arena this project is based on a supposed capitalist economic dynamism of africa expressed by the average rate of growth of its gdp which since the first decade of the 21st century has been above the world average making africa the second locomotive region after asia of world growth thus some african and indeed non african voices consider this as africa s century an afro optimism which seems in correlation with a renaissance or renewal of pan africanist discourse outside the au among the african intelligentsia and employers for the boosters of this supposed african economic dynamism there would be no incompatibility between the pan africanist ideal of the emancipation of the african peoples and the rooting of the supposed african economic dynamic in the neoliberalisation of capitalist globalisation yet the train of african integration risks ending up at a terminus other than that of the emancipation of the african peoples the oau and the african economic community project the idea of a single african market an african economic community is not a novelty it is linked to that of pan africanism as officially discussed immediately after the massive emergence of newly independent african states in the early 1960s thus on the eve of the creation of the oau one of the main protagonists in the debate ghana s president kwame nkrumah stressed the economic dimension of the gestating african unity or union but abstracting from this the question of social classes and their antagonistic interests resting on the principle of the african personality as well as the bandung spirt to win his fellow heads of state most of them comfortably installed in the networks of neo colonialism to the project of a unity and economic solidarity of african states in the interests of the african peoples it was in his view a condition for the conservation of political independence recently acquired by the great majority of african states and for the decolonisation of the entities remaining under the colonial yoke an african common market devoted uniquely to african interests would more efficaciously promote the true requirements of the african states such an african market presupposes a common policy for overseas trade as well as for inter african trade and must preserve our right to trade freely anywhere he argued furthermore the pooled sum of our present individual investments in our similar national projects if used within an integrated plan would give greater benefit in mutual development indeed the total integration of the african economy on a continental scale is the only way in which the african states can achieve anything like the levels of the industrialized countries this economic union nkrumah reiterated some time afterwards to his peers meeting in addis ababa for the birth of the oau should involve a single african currency an african central bank and so on which would require an african confederal political structure but this did not take into account the indefatigable attachment of virtually all the african heads of state to a balkanised independence often masked by the evocation of a very vague gradualism the intangibility of the borders inherited from colonisation being erected at this occasion into a principle this was to underestimate their preference to return to the fold of the former colonial rulers nkrumah speech during the creation of the oau under the form of institutions of cooperation set up with the colonial metropolis during decolonisation for neo colonial domination thus although the idea of the african common market had seemed shared beyond the handful of states then deemed progressive the signatories to an oau charter intended to coordinate and intensify their cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for the peoples of africa only stated that the member states shall coordinate and harmonize their general policies especially in the following fields a political and diplomatic cooperation b economic cooperation including transport and communications the unity finally obtained by the supposed founding fathers of pan africanism was reduced essentially to coordination and consultation in fact despite the subsequent existence of certain sub regional institutions central african customs and economic union east african community the creation of the oau had mainly consecrated the construction of african nation states dependent in general on central capitalism or neo colonial neocolonised from the lagos plan to the afcfta a decade later in the 1970s confronted with the persistence of under development or the development of under development these african states after having vainly participated with the countries of latin america and asia around forty of them constituting the acp countries which had drawn up the so called lomé i convention with the eec in 1975 an extension of the euro african yaoundé ii convention pleading at the un from 1973 to 1976 in favour of a new international economic order returned to the pan africanist project the formulation of this was the lagos plan of action for the economic development of africa 1980 2000 adopted by the second extraordinary session of the oau conference of heads of state and government lagos april 28 29 1980 the latter having noted the failure of global development strategies and the inability of african states to point to any significant growth rate or satisfactory index of general well being in the past 20 years as well as the exploitation of africa by neo colonialist external forces which seek to influence the economic policies and directions of african states committed itself to promote the economic integration of the african region in order to facilitate and reinforce social and economic intercourse leading to the eventual establishment of an african common market leading to an african economic community but this sort of return to the idea rejected at the birth of the oau did not come at any propitious moment the failure of development correctly identified overlooks the share of responsibility borne by those who managed the african states mismanagement as a factor in the primitive accumulation of private capital and so on leading nearly all the over indebted african states from the 1980s onwards into reliance on the bretton woods institutions advocates of neoliberal structural adjustment programmes and the washington consensus in fact this amounted to a reorganisation of the dependency of the african states economies in respect to the traditional capitalist powers in the context of a neoliberal restructuring of capitalist globalisation accentuated in the following decade by the end of the so called communist bloc an updating of dependency rather than self dependence integration in the neoliberal phase of globalisation rather than the creation of an african economic community of a capitalist nature certainly all this leading to a stronger grip by the transnationals principally of western origin on the african economy through the dispossession of the strategic enterprises of the states a minority of native capitalists also profited from this often linked to or constituted by the leaders of the african states for the popular classes including the lower layers of the middle classes there was pauperisation the lagos plan was replaced in june 1991 by the treaty establishing the african economic community signed in abuja then the new nigerian capital by 51 oau states the so called abuja treaty still referred to the lagos plan and the integration of african economies while seeing state commercial companies as actors in intra african exchanges it established a schedule of transition to the said community over a maximum 34 years anticipated for 2025 and divided into six stages a maximum of 10 years was set for free trade zones in regional economic communities in southern central eastern northern and western africa however although accepting the capitalist paradigm for the states and the oau technocracy this did not represent a pure and simple alignment about neoliberal capitalist globalisation and the restructuring of imperialist domination for example the un economic commission for africa had in an evaluation of the implementation of this treaty noted this contradiction concerning the fixing of a rate of participation of national capital from 30 to 51 according to the regional community for all industrial enterprises in certain regional communities it is not possible to want to attract massive foreign investment and at the same time establish a sub regional market virtually closed to foreign investors obviously on this issue most of the sub regional communities have not adapted to the neo liberal economic spaces emerging in african states this showed a certain desire to limit in the name of a supposed nationalism or pan africanism the grip of the transnationals on africa s economies thus favouring the development of african capital or african fractions of the capitalist class the national bourgeoisies to which the political leaders and those around them belonged without really addressing the aggravation of poverty among the popular classes in the 1980s and 1990s the lagos plan and the abuja treaty were in the 1990s the main reference points for an african economic nationalism superficially denouncing the neo colonialism of neoliberal structural adjustment ten years after the adoption of the abuja treaty as the oau became the au 2000 2002 the organisation publicly assumed a neoliberal orientation adopting in 2001 the new partnership for africa s development nepad drawn up under the auspices of the presidents of senegal abdoulaye wade south africa thabo mbeki algeria abdel aziz bouteflika and nigeria olusegun obasanjo a development programme allegedly by africans and for africans but criticised by the nigerian activist moussa tchangari as firmly mired in neoliberal dogma because of its compliance with the spirt of the bretton woods institutions nepad and the abuja treaty formed the basis of the au s new pan africanist project agenda 2063 the africa we want of which the entry into force of the afcfta is a decisive stage it is in the dynamic of assumption of this neoliberal option of pan africanism that we should see the enthusiasm expressed by nigeria s mahamadou issoufou responsible for the coordination of the process of negotiation of the agreement rwanda s paul kagame president of the au when the agreement was submitted for signature the rwandan patriotic front led by kagame is the proprietor of the holding crystal ventures ltd the biggest private employer in the country with investments around the world the technocrats of the au and nearly all the pan african media the afcfta is an african version of the regional free trade agreements which have become fashionable whether already signed or under negotiation this expanded and secure market for the goods and services of state parties through adequate infrastructure and the reduction or progressive elimination of tariffs and elimination of non tariff barriers to trade and investment preamble to the agreement has as its reference point with the constitutive act of the au and the abuja treaty the marrakesh agreement which created the world trade organisation wto thus it promises generally the same effects as free trade processes elsewhere a minority of winners and many losers as the ugandan activist yash tandon has put it in the context of free trade trade is war a war where the winners are generally the same the capitalist economies which are already the most dynamic and who are often initiators of the current wave of free trade agreements thus the united nations conference on trade and development has drawn attention to the continued erosion of the margin of action of developing countries produced by regional and bilateral trade agreements above all in the less developed countries with africa accounting for 33 of the 47 countries thus classified around the world however even inside the economies considered as the most dynamic there are winners and losers from free trade as the partner states are supposed to negotiate on the basis of the competitive advantages of their respective economies the agreements also reflect the inequalities between sectors inside the national economies as regards international competitiveness so some local economic sectors are sacrificed generally to the benefit of the transnationals of local origin as are the popular classes thus the growth of free trade increases the re production and aggravation of inequalities and pauperisation this does not prevent these agreements adopting formulas to the contrary for some year women youth and extreme poverty have been at the centre of a supposed attention to social justice on the part of these international institutions an apparent concern for social justice that some have called social neoliberalism expression of a neoliberal heterodoxy in the text of the afcfta the promise is to promote and attain sustainable and inclusive socio economic development gender equality and the protocol on services promises to improve the social and economic wellbeing of the whole of the african people an authentic desire for inclusion is not apparent in the opacity which characterises the drawing up and negotiation of these free trade agreements excluding civil society social movements and indeed parliaments including in states which claim a long tradition of representative democracy which can be considered as a semi admission of the undemocratic objectives of the drafts under negotiation whereas agenda 2063 undertakes to put â mobilization of the people and their ownership of continental programmes at the core according to the african branch of the third world network there is little space in the structures involved with the cfta for participation by civil society groups or the private sector the only possibilities so far seem to be episodic consultations with these groups outside any of the negotiating structures in vain a pan african network of organisations of civil society has requested that a space is created at the national regional and continental level for african citizens and socio economic groups like workers farmers producers enterprises civil society the private sector and so on for an effective participation in a democratic and transparent process that all information linked to the cfta and the process of negotiation and implementation are available in a timely fashion so that all citizens can make their contributions at the national regional and continental level for in the absence of a democratic process one of the minimal conditions for democracy is the availability to citizens of information on the said project to allow debate prior to a referendum consultation but the attitude taken to the negotiation of the cfta is only logical with respect to the contempt for even minimal democracy shown by many states of the au the institutions of the latter being generally led by former actors and members of the clientele of these states bearers of a political culture hostile to democracy thus in senegal often presented as one of the emblems of democracy in africa the overwhelming majority 99 999 of the population is not aware of the issues around the cfta even the intellectuals are not aware says economist ndongo samba sylla

index into a correction or a drop of 10 percent from its all time high for the second time in nine months a christmas eve plunge brought it briefly into bear market territory or a drop of 20 percent

originally posted on american renaissance august 29 2014 david stoll el norte or bust rowman littlefield 2013 281 pp 32 95 why are all those unaccompanied minors coming here from central america el norte or bust is an eye opening even astonishing account of how indigenous guatemalans live why they come north and what happens when they do it was written before the latest wave of minors but casts a pitiless light on the motives and methods of central american peasants who take huge risks to get into the united states the author david stoll is a far far left anthropologist at middlebury college in vermont he would love to think of indigenous guatemalans as noble creatures faithful to ancient mayan traditions but he is too honest to paint them in false colors these people are materialistic primitives both gullible and exploitative who treat women like cattle and are incapable of building a modern society studying their antics may be great fun for academics but these are obviously not people we want in our country prof stoll has been doing research in guatemala since the 1980s he reports that probably one of every nine guatemalans is in the us most of them illegally in 2010 they sent home 4 16 billion which was the biggest source of foreign exchange this shower of cash has produced a wave of mugging robbery and kidnapping since the legal system is corrupt angry mobs lynch suspected criminals usually by burning them to death there is very little public trust and the country is riven by clans and kinship groups no one cares about the greater interest and politics is a conspiracy to plunder public resources in short the country is a mess ll fourteen million guatemalans are at constant risk from collapsing infrastructure corrupt officials and out of control criminals more and more have concluded not just that their country does not function very well but that it will never function very well not least because it is inhabited by each other so they would prefer to leave the national desire to escape is why the country s leading newspaper prensa libre covers the u s immigration debate in greater detail than many american newspapers do and why guatemalan peasants are often better informed about the latest crackdown than americans are the annual flow of remittances from the united states has become an anxiously tracked index of national well being new schemes to escape guatemala receive prominent coverage spark rumors and enrich scam artists who in exchange for hefty fees offer foreign visas that never come through nebaj prof stoll has written several books about guatemala this one concentrates on the remote village of nebaj which is populated mainly by amerindians some of whom do not even speak spanish its 20 000 people are mostly poor and would consider themselves lucky to own a cow though almost all have cell phones nebajenses as they are called have traditionally been subsistence corn farmers and the women are known for brightly embroidered blouses prof stoll warns that his findings may not apply to the entire country but he suspects they do thanks to potable water and vaccinations guatemalan death rates have plummeted but indians who make up about 40 percent of guatemala s population still have six or seven children per woman the population of the nebaj area is an estimated five times greater than at the time of the spanish conquest so there is not enough land to go around everyone there has seen images of the united states on television and is greedy for motorcycles new houses big screen tvs and money to splash around curiously one of the most durable signs of western influence is evangelical christianity as many as 60 percent of nebajenses are pentecostal and prof stoll writes that christian music blares from boom boxes adding to the already terrific din of people and motorbikes aid officials are disconcerted to find that these descendants of the maya follow the religion that lefties despise the most but prof stoll thinks that meeting several times a week to a tuneful beat and going into a mild trance is probably harmless traditional life in nebaj was turned upside down by three things a guerrilla war the foreign aid that followed and the united states in the 1970s a marxist group set up a revolutionary force called the guerrilla army of the poor and some of the nebaj locals joined up the guatemalan army came and burned whole villages in reprisal after the fighting ended in 1983 the nebaj area become a mecca for foreign uplift artists of all sorts everyone especially wanted to help the indians there were other indigenous areas that suffered as badly from the fighting but prof stoll thinks nebaj got more than its share of aid because of the fancy blouses foreign aid whetted appetites for everything money can buy and had the unintended effect of helping pay the coyotes who smuggled nebajenses to america prof stoll estimates that remittances from the united states probably doubled the cash income of nebaj many of the nebajenses who went to the united states in the 1990s did well and came home flush with cash but the riches were not equally distributed garish mansions and cement high rises tower over the traditional adobe homes and red tile roofs people with dollars bought up farmland and land prices spiked all this provoked intense envy and sent more indians scampering north just the us economy crashed in 2008 the result has been catastrophe for many nebajenses most of whom had borrowed heavily to pay the coyotes who took them north how migration works prof stoll lays to rest a few myths it is not the poorest guatemalans who come north but the equivalent of the middle and upper middle classes guatemalan migrants are poverty stricken in relation to their rapidly rising expectations they are certainly not fleeing government or insurgent violence which ended 30 year ago though they tell spectacular lies about imagined persecution if they think they can get refugee status nor does prof stoll cite a single case of a guatemalan who was fleeing crime they all promise to come back after they make a bundle as prof stoll explains nebaj seethes with schemes to acquire wealth and going north is a scheme that sometimes actually works at the time prof stoll was writing it cost a guatemalan at least 5 000 in coyote fees to get into the united states where did households with an annual income of 1 500 get that kind of money they borrowed it some mortgaged their houses or their land others borrowed from other nebajenses at the prevailing interest rate of 10 percent per month some of the money originated as microcredits at lower interest rates from government banks or aid organizations that thought they were funding small businesses prof stoll found that coyotes are not an easy subject of study but learned that it takes a whole network of them to get a nebajense to arizona specialties include smuggling guatemalans into mexico getting them across mexico to the us border sneaking them across the border and getting them to a safe house the aspiring illegal pays 2 000 up front and then has a family member pay the rest after he phones to say he has made it to the safe house there is always the danger that coyotes will take the up front money and abandon his pollos or chickens well short of the united states but coyotes with bad reputations do not get repeat business there is so much money to be made in the coyote business that agents troll for customers and get a commission for everyone they sign up prof stoll finds that coyotes are not universally hated since they provide a useful service coyotes themselves believe they are offering people the chance of a lifetime if guatemalans are caught at the border they lie to the border patrol and claim to be mexican so they will be dumped back across the border rather than flown to guatemala some coyotes offer as many as three tries to get across the border most of the illegals are men and once they are in the us the idea is to send home as much money as possible even if it means working long hours and living like an animal prof stoll writes that an immigrant might work one eight hour shift at mcdonald s walk a mile to another mcdonald s and work another eight hour shift there may be four or more people to a bedroom furnished with nothing but mattresses and a big screen tv most of the men do not have bank accounts and hate blacks who sometimes rob them prof stoll finds that guatemalans prefer to work for whites who usually treat them fairly koreans and chinese exploit them ruthlessly but the worst are their own people the ultimate in profitability is to turn one s co ethnics or co nationals into a captive labor force most illegals get false documents including a social security number often the numbers belong to real people prof stoll notes one case in which nine different guatemalans were using the number of a man who was in prison all wages registered to a social security number add to the benefits that are paid after retirement so the prisoner was saving up nicely for old age guatemalan illegals try to keep out of sight still some are arrested for drunk driving and they are used to living so noisily americans live in silence says one that angry neighbors call the police on them some come to the attention of authorities when they get a woman pregnant and discover to their horror that wages can be garnished for child support an illegal who is deported before he has paid off the coyote debt is in a hole in desperation he may make another trip and dig himself a deeper hole a nabajense explains that if illegals die in a fight or a traffic accident the family expects money and gets a cadaver financing the trip a lot of the money used to pay coyotes is diverted from microcredits which were the favorite third world anti poverty snake oil of the 1990s and 2000s the idea was that peasants are brimming with entrepreneurial ideas and stay poor only because they can t get bank loans for some reason it was thought that most of these potential magnates were women and that with loans of a few thousand or even a few hundred dollars they would start rabbit farms or restaurants part of the idea was that lending would go to solidarity groups of people who would not get any more money if any member of the group defaulted in 2006 the bengali economist muhammad yunus won the nobel peace prize as the godfather of this miracle cure for poverty this was before it was learned that his grameen bank in bangladesh had lied about high repayment rates and that borrowers hated solidarity groups because there were always deadbeats who shafted everyone else solidarity groups destroyed community instead of fostering it in 2008 prof stoll counted no fewer than 23 different banks and non profits offering microcredits within a few minutes walk of the center of nebaj they lent money at 18 to 30 percent a year which was an irresistible rate for people used to paying 10 or even 15 percent a month some nebajenses borrowed from four or five different agencies and walked out with tens of thousands of dollars much of that of course was spent on immediate consumption but a lot of businesses were started too prof stoll notes that every conceivable business has now been started 10 times over and there are not enough customers for any of them naturally some nebajenses borrowed at 18 to 30 percent a year lent the money at 10 percent a month to people who wanted to go north and tried to live off the spread it is hard to collect on microborrowers who don t feel like paying also aid organizations want to help poor third worlders not foreclose on houses nebajenses soon learned that microcredits didn t always have to be repaid and borrowed all the more why did any nebajenses keep on borrowing at 10 or 15 percent a month some seem to have been more comfortable dealing with a cousin or neighbor they could get to at night in an emergency and others wanted to avoid any transaction the tax authorities might learn about this system tottered along until the crash of 2008 newly arrived illegals could not find work illegals already in the country lost their jobs loan payments stopped faced with massive and embarrassing defaults some of the foreign aid lenders tried to get money back by foreclosing that was when they learned that the same property might have been pledged to four different lenders that many land titles were hopelessly clouded and that nebajenses were so used to stiffing lenders that they raised mobs to stop foreclosures property prices had collapsed anyway so the collateral was not worth much by 2012 there were a lot of shattered dreams in nebaj a lot of out of work coyotes and a lot of aid organizations that were much poorer but apparently no wiser foreign aid the people who run foreign aid programs in guatemala are cut from the same far lefty cloth as prof stoll so he tries to be nice to them but they are clearly mooncalves they show up believing all sorts of mush about mayan wisdom harmony between genders respect for nature and consensual decision making prof stoll adds that because they are native americans international donors would like to believe that they are guardians of the earth keepers of ancient wisdom and faithful defenders of their culture the uplift artists also have an openly political agenda that might surprise taxpayers back home they hope that with the help of aid projects the nebajenses would recover their vocation as a revolutionary vanguard and help the guatemalan left win elections aid bureaucrats share the still widespread assumption that native americans are better persons than the rest of us that they have a strong cultural disposition to place the interests of the group ahead of the interests of the individual and that they are inherently communal and unselfish at least until corrupted by western civilization indians have learned to tell the donors exactly the sort of mayan nonsense that will make the money flow but inherently communal and unselfish they are not aid projects set in motion what prof stoll calls the ruthless subterranean competition for the spoils of office and aid projects become self enrichment schemes and patronage machines if the uplift artists ever tumble to how ruthlessly materialistic and competitive their darlings are they blame it on neo liberal capitalism or right wing oppressors prof stoll confesses that he too once had similar illusions aid is like a drug and prof stoll finds that nebajenses have become accustomed to crafting their problems into aid appeals it s all mysterious and magical and they end up believing that someone else wealthy foreigners or maybe god will rescue their children from being paupers many can t tell the difference between aid and a swindle smooth talkers come to town claiming to represent organizations with fancy names and intimate connections abroad instead of irrigation systems or new roofs which is typical aid industry fare they promise something even more mouth watering a pile of money however there are various expenses that must be met before the money arrives and the suckers are fleeced and strung along sometimes with evenings of fervent prayer for as long they stay gullible prof stoll writes of one hoax that promised brand new houses at least one man tore down his old house in anticipation of the new one that never came although some swindlers are run out of town or lynched some probably believe their own baloney prof stoll has found what he calls a cargo cult conviction that big checks materialize simply as a result of western bureaucratic rituals the magic of aid seems to encourage belief in more ancient kinds of magic zahorins are traditional witch doctors many of whom are also swindlers they promise riches to anyone who walks up to the rim of the sacred volcano almolonga so long as he makes regular payments to propitiate the spirits drinking in honor of the gods is a mayan tradition and drunks are easier to fleece some zahorins specialize in sleight of hand they pretend to turn a small bill into two small bills and then promise to do the same thing with a huge wad of cash the sucker mortgages his farm at 10 percent per month and puts several thousand dollars into the hands of the zahorin who disappears prof stoll writes bemusedly about women who have been taken in by three or four different zahorin he speculates that the wave of greed that swept through nebaj when some people started getting remittances from america has made people easier marks for fraud women because anthropologists defend the legitimacy of indigenous cultures prof stoll writes delicately we have been slow to focus on the second class status of mayan women second class prof stoll gets more specific what women expect from marriage is drunkenness brutality and betrayal life is terrible for guatemalan women and migration makes it worse prof stoll estimates that about half of the men who go north leave behind a family or a pregnant girlfriend if a guatemalan illegal finds a new woman in the united states he stops answering his cell phone or sending money even if he has a crop of children and a pile of debt the wife has to decide whether to give up on him and try to scrape up another man she may have to sell the house to pay off coyote debt or may send a son or a brother north to start the cash flow back up which requires yet more coyote debt it is taken for granted that when a man dumps a wife he also dumps the children few women make the trip north someone has to stay home with the children and they are afraid of being raped by coyotes a single woman who shows up among sex starved guatemalan men in america is likely to be raped or at least so heavily pressured for sex that she has to marry someone she then gets pregnant and can no longer work to pay off her debt there does not appear to be formal prostitution among the indians but many unmarried women have sex in the hope of money and favors a common seduction trick is for a man to promise a girl he will take her to america for the dream life and unload her after he gets what he wants sordid behavior drifts north prof stoll writes of a girl who was married at age 11 or 12 which is not uncommon to a man twice her age he died of causes unknown and she took up with another man at age 14 she got herself smuggled into the us and had coyote sex along the way she ended up in florida and gave birth unassisted in an immigrant apartment bled a lot and had to go to the emergency room her dead baby was found in the apartment with a wad of tissue stuffed down its throat and she spent 18 months in jail on murder charges she got so much sympathetic media coverage that a judge threw out the case and she was adopted by americans who sent her to high school prof stoll thinks that having lots of children is how nebaj women feel empowered although most of them are bringing mouths into the world they can t feed they put children to work around the house and on the farm at about age 10 and most get very little education women still think that children will support them in old age but prof stoll sees nothing but poverty for everyone he calls reckless procreation a reproductive pyramid scheme but notes that none of the aid organizations pushes contraception child migrants prof stoll wrote his book too soon to have anything to say about the latest rush for the border but we can figure out what is probably happening the local press no doubt reported all the high hopes for amnesty prof stoll notes that rumors of amnesty are always big news word got out that only minors from mexico and canada were being sent home without a hearing before an immigration judge that might not take place for years and that in the meantime illegals got free medical treatment and education coyotes drummed up flagging business by lying freely about permisos that are supposed to let minors stay in america all this has no doubt resulted in plenty of coyote debt most of these minors are young men in their late teens and are probably under orders to get jobs as soon as they can if they hit the jackpot and get amnesty they will no doubt bring their families over as quickly as possible where does all this lead prof stoll thinks that sealing the border is a violation of human rights but he does confess to have lost a few illusions he used to think that the biggest obstacle facing illegal guatemalans was racist white folks now he realizes that it is their own people who milk them mercilessly and that there aren t enough jobs for everyone who wants to come he dreams wistfully of the day when the capitalist system comes crashing down but is not so stupid as to think that would usher in utopia he concludes in good lefty fashion by warning his readers that come the crash guatemalan subsistence farmers may survive better than urban americans prof stoll refuses to draw obvious conclusions so i will indigenous guatemalans are a miserable lot who have no business in our country they come for one reason to make money and will lie and cheat to get here and stay here the main thing foreign aid does is whet the appetite for more foreign aid aid programs are run by dopes prof stoll has written a very useful and illuminating book thomas jackson email him is a staff writer for american renaissance

president yoweri museveni has warned that politics of defiance and un constitutionalism will not be tolerated in 2019 the president said that politicians must be clear on where they stand he used luganda and runyankore words to contextualise acceptable and unacceptable politics during his new year s message delivered from his country home in rwakitura our languages are more precise when it comes to describing actions verbs in luganda for instance there are the following words okuvuganya okulwaana okulemesa okutabula okuseketerera okusanyaawo or okutemula museveni said okuvuganya is what he called a peaceful way of putting forward alternative ideas about running society if a has built 100 schools in the area b can without telling lies truthfully say that with better discipline and more frugality he could have built 150 he argued museveni argued that the politics of fighting okulwaana defiance okulemesa or disorganization okutabula is not good for the country okulemesa a singular verb for tubalemese which has been a vocal anti government catchphrase of forum for democratic change fdc since 2016 contested presidential election tubalemese was equally evoked during the 2017 age limit constitution amendment that led to deletion of the 75 year age cap for presidential candidates fingers were pointed at museveni who will turn 75 years in 2019 as the sole beneficiary of the amendment when he referred to politics of okulwaana and okutabula museveni could have been indirectly talking about firebrand youthful people power politicians led by kyadondo east legislator robert kyagulanyi aka bobi wine bobi wine and his colleagues clashed with security forces in august on the last day of campaign for arua municipality by election a number of mps were arrested and tortured for allegedly stoning museveni s car the incident which attracted international denunciation will leave an indelible mark on uganda s political scene for years museveni said there are double faced opposition politicians with a leg in constitutional politics and another in un constitutionalism politics which will not be allowed no politicians museveni warned should expect to be allowed go around promoting acts of political indiscipline but 2019 is expected to be a year of intensified politicking ahead of 2021 general elections opposition politician kizza besigye has already declared 2019 a year of action below is the ful speech countrymen and countrywomen greetings to all of you and congratulations on going through christmas and the end of the year well those who died in the course of the year we pray to god to rest their souls in eternal peace and also help their families and communities to cope with the loss we pray to god to help them manage to succeed in life even with the departure of their loves ones as far as the sick are concerned we pray to god to give them quick recovery on this occasion i will raise only nine issues these are 1 a brief comment on the economy 2 youth development and employment 3 crime 4 political discipline 5 regional integration 6 corruption 7 political leaders as examples in wealth creation 8 irrigation and 9 land evictions as the various officials of the state have been saying recently the economy of uganda is once again on track to grow at a fast rate in the last 32 years since the advent of the nrm the economy has always been growing at the rates of 6 3 and above per annum except for the years 1986 1987 2012 2013 one of the causes for that deceleration was the mistake of the 7th parliament that delayed the dam of bujagali in the year 2002 it is that mistake that caused the power shortages of 2005 up to 2012 that mistake caused the slow down of the economy referred to above the other cause has been the occasional bad weather in the form of inadequate rains like in the years of 2016 and 2017 even with these dives the average rate of growth of the economy eversince 1986 has been 6 3 per annum in some years the growth rate went up to 11 per annum this was in the years 1994 95 96 these mistakes happen except of course for the weather in spite of my advice in the constitutional review the ugandans should address the issue of a discordant executive and parliament in uk if the prime minister and the parliament do not agree both of them resign and new elections are held so as not to cause paralysis in the development plans of the ruling political parties it ensures continuous accountability through representation anyway i managed to handle all those diversions and in 2006 caused the government to give due prioritization to electricity development and the tarmacking of roads you can now see the impact that little rectification effort of 2006 has now resulted into pushing the electricity generation capacity of the country to 1 800megawatts by 2020 compared to the 60megawatts of 1986 just on account of that the economy last financial year 2017 18 grew by 6 1 above the previously projected level of 5 5 financial year 2018 2019 will grow at the rate of 6 yet the cost of electricity is still high by default on account of the costly money that was used in bujagaali the cost of bujagaaali is 13 38 american cents per unit without subsidy after waiver of corporate taxes the bujagali tariff reduced to 10 5 american cents per unit and with the debt refinancing the bujagali tariff has reduced to 8 5 american cents that of nalubaale njeru side and kiira jinja side is 2 american cents karuma will be us 4 97 cents and isimba will be us 4 16 cents per unit this is a distortion we are struggling to solve so that industrial power is at 5 american cents i am told that umeme is part of the distorters the distribution costs by umeme account for 34 the total cost of power to the end user in ethiopia i am told that the transmission and distribution costs account for only 8 the total cost and in kenya it accounts for 11 the total cost nevertheless in spite of all these distortions in the power sector the economy is already growing at the rate of 6 1 as shown above we are going to end this distortion in the power sector working with kenya and tanzania the issue of transport costs will be addressed by developing the rail transport and water transport and through udb address the issue of the cost of money for manufacturing agriculture and some of the services such as hotels and the entertainment industry therefore soon after a protracted struggle for economic recovery eversince the low level of 1986 we shall have the 3 important ls and one important c the 3 important ls are the low cost of electricity low cost of transport and low cost of money the important c is the comparative advantage in the cost of labour i do not want to talk of the low cost of labour because in a healthy way the cost of labour in uganda will rise as the economy expands nevertheless the remaining challenges notwithstanding on account of the successes we have achieved in power generation as well as on account of the previous policy reforms privatization liberalization security of person and property mass education etc the economy has already resumed its high trajectory of growth of 6 and above i even predict that it will hit double digit rates because uganda has got everything if all the elements are optimally used the results are exciting the foreign exchange earnings for instance were as follows in 2017 18 financial year a export of goods us 3 536billion b export of services us 1 832billion c remittances by ugandans working abroad us 1 244million total us 6 612billiion this is as compared to us 7 692 billion that we spent on imports of goods and services in the financial year 2017 18 regional exports were interesting uganda exported to the region eac and comesa goods and services worth us 3 943billion we imported from the region goods and services worth us 1 673 billion we therefore had a trade surplus of us 2 270 billion many non tariff trade barriers ntbs still found in some of the member states notwithstanding with the numerous new factories being commissioned these earnings will grow the exports to the region are steel and steel products dairy products beverages electronics grains maize millet rice beans fruits and vegetables spices coffee tea sugar and confectionery plastic products etc the exports to international destinations beyond the region are gold coffee cocoa tea fish and fish products cotton flowers cobalt fruits and vegetables on the issue of the youth which is number two on my list i am very optimistic about their future why it is because we have already laid quite a foundation for them the youth of the nrm time were first ante natally supported by attending to the health of the mother while still pregnant when the baby was born we immunized the child that is how the population of uganda jumped from 14 million to 40 million people today almost all the nrm youth are free of polio and measles until very recently when i saw a report about some careless mothers that failed to take children for immunization and they caught measles that outbreak of measles should alert everybody what the consequences of negligence are we soon introduced universal primary education upe and universal secondary education use which have raised the level of the adult literacy rate from 43 to 75 the gaps we still have are skills for many of these youth jobs wealth creation and sometimes discipline in my many state of the nation addresses i have told the country that projects have already started that can convert un employed youth to job creators and property owners through grants or low cost revolving loans these programmes will be expanded at the same time the skilling of the youths in technical schools or through special courses will continue these youths will be helped to produce goods and services for import substitution and export promotion in addition to the many internal distribution products and services they are already producing i salute the many youth that flock the worship centres to pray to god and to listen to the scriptures i only caution them on illusions of miracle wealth lubaale mbeera nembiro kwotadde our ancestors pointed out long ago it translates as god helps those who help themselves similarly i advise those who flock to drinking centres and take narcotic drugs to seek for help the nrm leaders in the localities should seek out these youth and help them with advice wherever possible another advice to the youth is frugality do not be extravagant and showy be frugal simple and hardworking as a youth i led my family and my area in modernization and wealth creation away from the ancient traditional ways this was on top of the political work we were engaged in we never wasted money on alcohol luxuries reveling ebinyumo or foreign travel the youth who listen to our advice will succeed the third issue i would like to comment on is crime in my address to the parliament of the 20thjune 2018 i outlined the 12 action points that we are undertaking and we shall undertake to immunize our country against the crime that spiked up especially in the towns the main thrust of my address was to upgrade the technological base of the country in the anti crime fight those upgrades are going on nevertheless even using the old police methods of relying on public vigilance quick response from the police proper management of the crime scene etc the police force is already achieving success in dealing with the criminals in my social media message of 20thdecember 2018 i gave some details during the current festive season the police have told me that 23 offences were reported on christmas day there were 11 murders one victim of mob justice two incidents of murder by shooting one suicide case one defilement one suicide by shooting one attempted murder one incident of accidental death by fire one case of vandalizing umeme cables by thieves one case of kidnap but victim rescued and one case of arson therefore according to the police the crime incidences were 23 during the just passed christmas of mainly isolated crimes that are not organized when i looked at the 23 incidents of crime reported on the 25thof december 2018 the majority of them appeared to be straight forward crimes resulting from fights suicides etc where suspects are easy to determine there are the cases of a teacher female murdered at the beach in jinja an old woman murdered in kabonera masaka a man shot dead in the nakivaale refugee camp plus one or two others that may need more scrutiny in the case of kabonera masaka the local police leaders need to explain why they delayed to respond i am demanding expeditious accountability it seems therefore that otherwise our vigilance is working in any case by the end of this new year our anti crime posture will be totally different on top of the vigilance of the public and the promptness of the police we shall have added the technological means we are developing crime will be defeated the fourth issue is political indiscipline by some actors our languages are more precise when it comes to describing actions verbs in luganda for instance there are the following words okuvuganya okurwaana okuremesa okutabura okuseketerera okusanyawoor okutemura okuvuganya is a peaceful way of putting forward alternative ideas about running society if a has built 100 schools in the area b can without telling lies truthfully say that with better discipline and more frugality he could have built 150 then the debate can go on peacefully until election time when the electorate can decide on the two options however to behave in a double faced way where you have one leg in constitutional politics parliament municipality district council and another in un constitutionalism okuremesa okuseketerera okutemura etc cannot be allowed therefore those who are not clear on this point should get it clearly ugandan patriots have invested alot of energy in creating stability in uganda nobody will be allowed to destabilize this you heard how our economy is growing nobody should expect that we shall tolerate anybody diverting the country with indiscipline verging on criminality the fifth point is corruption there is no way the nrm can fail to defeat corruption the nra updf promptly stopped extortion on road blocks extra judicial killings by the army sectarianism poaching of wildlife in the national parks and the brutalizing of the wanainchi power over public finances public contracts public service jobs etc was left with five officials the permanent secretary in the ministry the chief administrative officer cao in the district the town clerk in a municipality the gombolola chief in a sub county and the financial controller in an autonomous self accounting institution such as a university an agency etc in order to check on these we created new institutions new instruments and new laws such as the igg the leadership code etc in spite of all these corruption has been rampant the nra updf cadres have not been involved directly in this fight against corruption we have been relying on the officers from the institutions we inherited in 1986 the civil service the judiciary etc in 1986 we could not have done much on this issue first of all we did not have enough educated man power to man agencies that needed high levels of education secondly however even if we had had manpower it would not have been wise to displace the old civil servants and replace them with our own cadres we would have been unfair to the incumbents it is good that we gave them a chance which many have misused fortunately on account of the massive education programmes we have rolled out we have a very large number of educated people that are ready to replace the corrupt civil servants i have created a new unit headed by lt colonel edith nakalema this is not to replace the igg it is in order to assist her there is a 24 hours call centre where people can report bribery efforts embezzlement land evictions crime etc the unit then contacts the police the igg so that they handle the cases they then help the igg the police igp the chief justice to monitor the actions of their juniors and they also report to me this corruption is easy to defeat for the nrm the sixth problem is land evictions these again will stop i will directly lead the struggle against illegal land evictions most of the people being evicted are either the elders i led in the resistance wars or their descendants they did not abandon the nra and i will not abandon them the four categories of the legal bibanjaowners are those whose ancestors were found on that land those allowed on that land by the land owner or his agent the bonafide occupants that were on that land by 1983 or the ones who bought or inherited from any of the four 4 categories there is even a fifth category the one who is not among the 4 categories above but has been on this kibanja for 12 years without anybody challenging him her we call this ownership by adverse possession or rather the lawyers call it so we are liaising closely with the cj and my lawyers will sue all legal means to defend our comrades in the struggle or their descendants the message to the landlords is that i prefer a win win way that is why i supported the abolition of the idi amin decree of 1975 we cannot however tolerate the unfair treatment of our comrades in the struggle the bibanja owners seventh i would like to salute all the elected leaders of the local councils and the nrm structures i salute you for your voluntary spirit of offering to lead the people that elected you and for sometimes leaving unattended your private affairs in order to attend to the issues of the population this sacrifice should not go unnoticed besides it is crucial that you lead by example it says in the book of mathew 5 16that let your light so shine before men that they will see your deeds and praise your father in heaven therefore i want you to be examples in wealth creation while therefore owc for the whole population i want to propose a sacco district by district that will cater for all the elected leaders of the lcs and the nrm structures so that they can be examples to the others but they will also banish poverty in their homes since the large numbers do not allow the payment of salaries this is the only affordable way of supporting these leaders past and present once a leader always a leader the eighth point is that in order to further stabilize our economy we are now beginning the long journey of weaning okuchutsya our agriculture from rain fed agriculture to irrigation we are using three methods of agriculture gravity based irrigation like the doho one using river manafwa and mobuku using river mobuku micro solar pumping from a water source to a high elevation then gravity takes over and bulk water transfer from a big source like the river kagyera or nalubaale l victoria to a high elevation and then gravity takes over the micro irrigation projects that are either operational or planned will be 190 across the country annex i the new mega projects that are on going planned are i doho phase ii in butalejja district ii mubuku phase ii in kasese district iii wadelai in nebbi district iv tochi in oyam district v ngenge in sebei zone vi atari bulambuli and kween vii kabuyanda isingiro viii amagoro tororo district ix matanda isingiro x nyimur lamwo xi kawumu in luwero district xii katete in kanungu district these are in addition to the old one of doho mobuku olweny and agoro we have encouraged solar powered water pump producers to either assemble or manufacture those pumps here so that we can roll them out en masse for individual farmers to buy them and immunize themselves against the erratic rains the ninth and final point is the issue of african integration in order to guarantee our prosperity when we produce goods and services which big market will absorb them the more people buy from us the more prosperous our businesses become that is why the nrm insists on patriotism within uganda pan africanism in africa and international trade on the basis of comparative advantage globally therefore in 2019 i hope to work with the fraternal peoples of kenya tanzania rwanda burundi and south sudan to consolidate the unity of east africa additionally through comesa and au we shall work with the wider africa to build the african common market i wish all of you a happy and successful 2019
four years ago raimondo took the oath what did she promise and what did she get done four years ago governor gina raimondo took the oath of office for her first term as governor in her inaugural speech she laid out her agenda for the next four years in anticipation of her second inaugural address golocal breaks down her first term goals and promises what did she promise to do and what was done in her first four years as governor the following is her 2015 speech and her results over the past four years as governor of rhode island inaugural address governor gina m raimondo january 6 2015 my fellow rhode islanders it is a great honor to address you today i am humbled by the challenges before us mindful of the many rhode island families struggling with some of the toughest economic conditions that we ve ever faced and deeply grateful that you ve put your trust in me let me begin by expressing our shared heartfelt appreciation to governor chafee for his more than 25 years of dedicated public service to our state let us also acknowledge the brave men and women serving in uniform our troops first responders and correctional officers thank you for your service and let me thank my wonderful family for supporting me at every step i love you the challenges that any governor inherits define the possibilities before them and how we solve intractable problems is limited only by our creativity and by our courage to tackle the most difficult challenges over the past 30 years we ve watched the foundation of our economy our manufacturing base erode our manufacturing sector used to provide good middle class jobs for rhode island families and as it has withered nothing has taken its place fact according to rhode island department of labor and training the number of rhode islanders working in the manufacturing sector in january 2015 when raimondo entered office was 41 400 and in november 2018 the most recent data available the number working in manufacturing had declined by 400 jobs to 41 000 rhode island lost manufacturing jobs in raimondo s first 4 years in just the last year we ve had the highest unemployment rate in the country for nine straight months we ve been 49th among states where companies want to do business and dead last for helping entrepreneurs fact rhode island now has the 28th highest unemployment in the u s and it is above the national average rhode island peaked in july 2018 with 504 300 rhode islanders working although the majority of new jobs have been lower paying jobs at the same time our government has become larger but less effective we face an unsustainable budget deficit yet our roads bridges and school buildings are crumbling fact under governor raimondo the number of state employees has significantly increased to the highest level since 2009 according to the house fiscal staff the number of state employees is now 14 058 the number of state employees has grown under raimondo to the highest level in a decade fact rhode island s roads and bridges were the 50th ranked in the united states raimondo did spearhead the rhodeworks program to create a controversial process to improve the state s bridges by tolling trucks as of october of 2018 according to a usa today report rhode island is still ranked 50 for the quality of roads and bridges as a result workers are insecure families are vulnerable and too many cities are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy and far too many young people are leaving to seek opportunities elsewhere but just as troubling is a growing belief held by too many rhode islanders that our problems are just too big to solve that there s nothing we can do and that our leaders don t get it don t care or are rendered ineffective by a broken system which caters to the few the connected we ve witnessed a growing acceptance that this is rhode island it s just the way things are so we ve lowered our expectations deferred our dreams and allowed corruption to take root fact in october 2018 a poll by john della volpe of harvard university found that a greater number of rhode islanders believe that rhode island was on the wrong track rather than the right direction today we begin to change this attitude it is time to stop our decline and to ignite a rhode island comeback it s not something that will happen on its own or that we can wait for someone else to do every person within the sound of my voice and far beyond has a role to play i need you rhode island needs you and generations to come need you to get involved and be part of the solution most important we must believe it is possible to have this comeback that our families deserve and commit ourselves to a new way of doing things at times these changes will be uncomfortable so often we ve resisted new ideas because people say we ve never done it that way but doing it the way we ve always done it has landed us here we need new politics and new ideas too many interest groups have crowded into this building for too long putting their short term self interests before the long term interests of all rhode islanders fact raimondo has raised more money from special interests than any rhode island candidate in the history of the state her campaign spent more than 11 million she has taken money from the state s lobbyist for the national rifle association had a fundraiser scheduled by a top tobacco ceo in new york city and has taken more than 12 000 from one of the top opioid executives in the united states today i ask rhode islanders to think differently ask yourself what role can i play in the comeback of rhode island how can we as elected leaders represent all of the concerns of a diverse people how can business leaders develop new strategies to meet payroll and expand jobs here in rhode island how can our educators create cutting edge laboratories of learning where we teach the next generation of innovators and leaders to get there we may have to give up a little of our narrow self interest and give something back to our community that s how america works and that s how we will get rhode island back to work we need that eternal optimism shown by our founders who believed in divine intervention good fortune and yes providence the idea that through god s grace all things are possible because they are the truth is our only path out of this mess is to create middle class family supporting jobs and so we must foster an environment where businesses want to add jobs and where we support our workers if we do that if we rebuild this economy everything is possible and if we don t nothing else will matter let s create a place where people know that you can make it in rhode island whether it s the young man preparing to graduate from high school the new mom who sees nothing but promise for her children or the little girl who knows she can be anything she wants with hard work i want rhode island to be a place of boundless opportunity for everyone middle class jobs are how we keep young people in rhode island â how we move people off of public assistance how we rejuvenate neighborhoods and secure the resources to invest in education and infrastructure and save for a rainy day fact according to pew research rhode island s middle class has decreased under raimondo the percentage of rhode islanders who are middle class in 2013 was 50 3 percent and that decreased to 49 7 percent in 2016 but more important than all of that a steady job is the lifeblood of a healthy and thriving family i learned this growing up watching my father who worked for nearly three decades at the bulova watch factory as a kid i saw that there was a job for everyone in his carpool but i also remember him struggling to start all over again when the company moved his job overseas too many rhode islanders today face similar job uncertainty and challenges every decision we make must pass the test of whether or not it will create opportunity for rhode island families in everything we do we must ask ourselves how will this create good middle class jobs and then have the fortitude to act accordingly to spark rhode island s comeback we have to do three things first build the skills our students and workers need to compete in the 21st century fact rhode island schools score 17 percent and 20 percent lower than massachusetts schools in ela and mathematics raimondo has added full day kindergarten and computer science classes across the state overall rhode island s schools have seen little improvement if any over the past four years under raimondo second attract entrepreneurs and investment in industries of our strengths to stimulate our economy and create jobs fact raimondo s administration has attracted a range of major corporations to rhode island companies like ge and johnson johnson and each of these companies have received substantial incentives the state has also retained companies like virgin pulse and at cross regarding investment there has been some out of state private investment mostly in apartment buildings and hotels the proposed fane tower has been held up for more than two years and was not completed under nor permitted in raimondo s first term and third innovate including in our state government to enhance accountability and deliver value to taxpayers fact the department of business regulation under raimondo was aggressive in reducing state regulations tens of thousands of pages were eliminated the raimondo administration has been widely and consistently criticized by media companies and open government groups for lack of transparency golocal sued the raimondo administration for refusing to release state police interviews in the 38 studios case we all know the economy is changing rapidly the question is whether we are preparing rhode islanders to be winners in this new environment education is a ladder of opportunity so we need to modernize our school buildings support dedicated educators and make college accessible for more families fact during her first four years raimondo did little to rebuild schools but did spearhead the passage of a 250 million general obligation bond which was approved by state voters in 2018 dedicated to rebuilding rhode island schools according to a blue ribbon panel ri has more than 2 billion in pressing needs fact raimondo launched the ri promise program which allows students to attend the community college of ri tuition free but simultaneously there have been tuition increases at both the university of rhode island and rhode island college we need to ensure effective training opportunities for workers of all ages that align with the jobs that are in demand to create stable jobs we also have to cultivate conditions that will make businesses want to invest here before adding jobs they want to know that there will be a steady supply of well trained workers and a 21st century infrastructure they look for clear and streamlined regulations and a predictable tax structure and perhaps most importantly a level playing field where everyone can get ahead based upon what you know not who you know we need a growth strategy focused on our strengths in the marine science health care tourism and food industries which we implement every day fact tourism has increased over the past four years from 50 200 jobs in january of 2015 to 58 500 in november of 2018 according to the rhode island department of labor and training healthcare employment has seen an increase from 80 600 to 82 700 jobs and we must revive our manufacturing sector if we make things here families can make it in rhode island we also have to innovate in everything we do including the way government works in rhode island let s operate a government that is customer friendly and creatively finds ways to help families succeed it is time to redesign government modernize hiring practices and instill accountability for results let s improve medicaid by cracking down on fraud delivering better care and improving efficiency let s provide more digital services to citizens and facilitate online permitting for businesses fact according to the center for digital government s report issued in october 2018 rhode island is one of the worst ranked state governments for technology it is tied with alaska with the lowest grade the digital states survey evaluates states use of technology to improve service delivery increase capacity streamline operations and reach policy goals and assigns each state a grade based on quantifiable results under raimondo rhode island has had and continues to have one of its worst controversies related to the uhip program which a portion of the program is under federal court control the overall program has cost hundreds of millions over budget and is mired in multiple lawsuits and let s help our cities and towns share services to reduce operating costs instead of simply throwing money at problems we must be outcome oriented and insist on citizens getting their money s worth from their tax dollars we must do all of this with urgency because our budget shortfall is severe this year and there are even darker clouds on the horizon we cannot continue doing what we ve been doing annually scraping together enough cuts and revenues to make it through the next year let s commit ourselves to eliminating our structural deficit over the next several years to put our state on sound footing and to making the tough choices so that we will also be able to invest in job creating priorities my fellow rhode islanders at this moment we face a choice we can continue on our current path avoiding the difficult decisions because we are afraid of special interests or political ramifications or simply of changing the way we ve always done it if we stay on the course we re on our children will be left behind more cities and towns will go bankrupt and other states will continue to pass us by but there s another choice a better path i want everyone to have the opportunity to make it in rhode island so i am asking you to join me in reaching for something better the job won t be done in two five or ten years the problems we face weren t created overnight and they won t be solved overnight either at each step of our journey we will measure our work in lives changed opportunities created and families saved this is my pledge to you i will wake up every morning focused on expanding opportunity for families in rhode island no matter how long it takes or how many obstacles are thrown in our way i don t have all the answers just ask my kids they will tell you that but i will go anywhere and work with anyone who wants to do what s right for rhode island i am committed to collaborating with speaker mattiello and senate president paiva weed who i know share my focus on getting rhode islanders back to work the challenges before us are real i get that but hear this rhode island together we will meet those challenges as i prepared for this day i spoke with a friend of mine someone who many of us know and are praying for sister ann keefe sister ann s work has been teaching non violence and like most things in life it s a work in progress but she never loses faith at a time when all you have to do is hear the word ferguson you realize that the challenge of our time is to simply get along a little better and to respect one another to be a better example for our children to teach them that solving a problem shouldn t mean caving in to those with the loudest voices it often means listening to those who are the quietest i would ask that if you remember only one thing from this day that it be this we re all in this together governor mario cuomo who sadly passed away last week reminded us that we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another our collective future is tied to rebuilding our economy in a way that expands opportunity for all families and leaves no one behind i believe this is why we are all here today we are tying our fates together and with god s guidance we will find a way thank you god bless all of you and god bless the state of rhode island enjoy this post share it with others
