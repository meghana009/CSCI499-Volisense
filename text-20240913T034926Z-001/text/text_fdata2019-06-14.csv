overview worries about an escalation in the gulf following us accusations that iran was behind yesterday s two attacks and weaker growth impulses while trade tensions remain high are dampening risk appetites ahead of the weekend equities are lower nearly all the stock markets in the asia pacific region fell today with japan and australia being the notable exceptions the msci asia pacific index will take a three day losing streak into next week europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is giving back half of the week s gains with a 0 4 loss through late morning turnover only utilities are posting gains which is partly a reflection of the continued rally in bonds disappointing chinese and new zealand dollar has seen the antipodean 10 year benchmark yields fall to new record lows and pushing their currencies lower european yields are mostly two to four basis points lower the benchmark yields in germany spain portugal and greece are at new record lows the us 10 year yield is off about three basis points to almost 2 05 the dollar is firmer against most of the major currencies in addition to the heavier tone for the australian and new zealand dollars sterling is also leading the pack lower for the week the us dollar has risen against all the majors though against the yen it is virtually flat oil is paring yesterday s gains but is still off 3 8 4 0 this week and gold is higher for the 11th of the past 13 sessions and has moved above 1350 for the first time since april 2018 asia pacific china s data disappointed and although the recently announced stimulative measures have yet to be picked up by the data additional steps to support the economy are likely another reduction in required reserves may be delivered in the coming weeks industrial output slowed to 5 in may from 5 4 in april it was weaker than expected and is the slowest pace since 2002 fixed asset investment slowed to 5 6 from 6 1 it is the lowest since last september the one upside surprise was retail sales helped by a long holiday at the beginning of the month retail sales accelerated to 8 6 from 7 2 year over year rate in april protests in china are likely to continue over the weekend hong kong equities were lower today for the second session but not out of line with the regional moves the hong kong dollar s peg is under no pressure whatsoever in fact it is near its best level for the year currently a person committing a crime in china and fleeing to hong kong cannot be extradited back to china however many fear that the law will be used to subject foreign investors and hong kong citizens at mainland law though the extradition bill excludes political crimes this is emerging as another bipartisan foreign policy issue in the us a bill that would require the state department to evaluate hong kong s autonomy every year to renew hong kong s special trade treatment under which it is not treated as a chinese city the current tariffs levied on china do not apply to hong kong the extradition bill could jeopardize hong kong s privilege and could be another point of leverage in the ongoing us china trade dispute the dollar yen exchange rate has been confined to a little more than 6 10 of a yen this week three month implied vol dipped below 6 5 for the first time this month it has been stuck on the jpy108 handle today s option expirations may continue to restrict the price action there is a nearly 640 mln option atjpy108 and one for about 380 mln at jpy108 45 lower yields and weaker equities amid heightened uncertainty keeps the dollar s downside exposed disappointing chinese data and soft new zealand data homes sales and april pmi took the australian dollar down in sympathy the new zealand dollar fell every day this week after advancing the previous six consecutive sessions it is at the lows for the month today 0 6540 the aussie has been pushed below 0 6900 for the first time in june it has not distanced itself much from this level where a roughly a 615 mln option will be cut today last month a base had been forged near 0 6865 the dollar edged higher against the chinese yuan for the third session it has gained a net 0 2 this week europe after the first round of voting the main question is who will emerge as the alternative to boris johnson he won handsomely with 114 votes more than the next three candidates combined foreign secretary hunt was in a distant second with 43 votes three candidates were eliminated the next round will be june 18 of the seven candidates the one with the least amount of votes will be cut as will any candidate that does not get at least 33 votes the bottom three or four candidates may try to combine forces after the tory mps narrow the choice of candidates for the next leader to two the rank and file will pick the new tory leader will lead a minority government and it is not clear that the dup which may s government relied on will support a tory government willing to leave with only the wto trade terms and no deal with the eu new national elections could result which would be the third in four years the flash pmi readings are the economy highlight from the eurozone next week if one looks closely something of a recovery may be underway the composite pmi bottomed in january and a small gain to 52 0 is expected here in june that would be the highest since last november and would put the q2 average at 51 7 compared with 51 5 in q1 the euro has eased to a new low for the week 1 1260 it is the first day this week and the first since june 4 that the euro has not traded above 1 13 it may be being blocked today by the expiry of 4 4 bln euros in options struck there the 1 11255 area corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of the rally from last month s test on 1 11 below there is 1 1225 around where the 20 day moving average is found and the next 50 retracement objective sterling which is also at lows for the week 1 2635 is probing the 61 8 retracement of this month s bounce then there is the 1 26 area america today s us retail sales and industrial production reports follow a disappointing employment report and soft inflation retail sales which account for a little more than 40 of household consumption have been firm the monthly average through the first four months was 0 5 compared with 0 1 in the same period a year ago however the path has not been smooth as retail sales have fallen in two of the four months the components used for gdp purposes have also been firm overall even if in a sawtooth pattern the sales in the control group have risen by an average of 0 6 this year so far and 0 1 average in the first third of 2018 industrial output has been weak it has fallen in three of the past four months averaging a 0 3 decline compared with a 0 4 gain in the year ago period manufacturing output itself has not risen this year and economists are hopeful of the first gain this year in may the market may not accept disappointment well yet nearly three cuts have been fully discounted over the next five meetings the fed funds futures contract implies about a one in three chance that the first cut is delivered next week the g20 summit is two weeks away and trump s economic adviser kudlow acknowledged that no formal arrangements for a meeting between xi and trump have been set kudlow reiterated trump s threat that there will be consequences for refusing the invitation at the same time kudlow reaffirmed the us position that it cannot accept a balanced agreement because the relationship is out of balance both in the deal that mnuchin had struck that trump walked away from last year and more recently china has offered to buy more us goods to reduce the bilateral imbalance although china s share of us imports is a little large than japan s was in the early 1980s more of china s work is assembling components so the value added in the prc and in yuan is less than was the case for japan pension reform is the key to fiscal reform in brazil it has been stymied for several years there has been concern that president bolsonaro was diluting his political capital by antagonizing his rivals and pursuing a controversial social agenda at the expense of needed reforms the congressional reform bill coordinator projected that the government s bill will generate savings of around brl913 5 bln 237 bln over a decade formal discussion can begin next week and a preliminary vote is likely before the congressional recess starting july 18 although investors have been disappointed before there is new optimism that the pension reform can pass brazil s equities and real rose by nearly 0 5 yesterday on the week coming into today the dollar has fallen against the real by about 0 8 which if it holds will be the fourth consecutive weekly decline as it consolidates near two month lows the bovespa is also set to extend its advancing streak for the fourth straight week during which time it has gained around 10 the us dollar has risen against the canadian dollar the first three sessions of the week before slipping slightly yesterday it is firmer today and is caught between two chunky option expirations today there is one set at cad1 33 for 880 mln and another set at cad1 3350 for nearly 580 mln the greenback was testing the upper end of that range in the european morning it had found support just ahead of cad1 33 yesterday we note that the us two year premium continues to narrow and today near 40 bp it is at a new low since march of last year near mxn19 215 the us dollar is recouping some of this week s loss but is still off about 2 on the week the dollar bottomed earlier this week a little below mxn19 09 the high today mxn19 23 is the highest since the low was reached on tuesday recall that last week s low was around mxn19 4670 this week s high set on monday was almost mxn19 33 and it appears the large gap is attracting prices disclaimer
by the ongoing trade war between the united states and china and the rhetoric surrounding it coming out of the white house has served to reinforce the idea that china is stealing jobs from the united states the reality however is that if we are seeking the responsible party our attention should be directed toward u s corporate boardrooms the internal logic of capitalist development is driving the manic drive to move production to the locations with the most exploitable labor not any single company industry or country for a long time that location was china although some production particularly in textiles is in the process of relocating to countries with still lower wages such as bangladesh cambodia and vietnam the last of those is already a long time source of highly exploited cheap labor for nike it could be said that china is opportunistic in turning itself into the world s sweatshop and that it constitutes a colossal market is no small factor low wages and the inability of chinese workers to legally organize are crucial factors in the movement of production to china the minimum wage in shanghai is 2 420 renminbi per month which equals us 349 per month and shanghai s minimum wage is the country s highest rate and roughly double the minimum wage in smaller cities across china reports the china labour bulletin that does not translate into a living wage for chinese workers the bulletin states national government guidelines stipulate that the minimum wage should be at least 40 percent of the local average wage in reality the minimum wage is usually only between 20 and 35 percent of the average wage barely enough to cover accommodation transport and food costs workers on the minimum wage including most production line workers unskilled labourers shop workers etc have to rely on overtime bonuses and subsidies in order to make a living wage as a consequence if the employer cancels or reduces overtime bonuses and other benefits low paid workers will often demand immediate restoration even with such meager pay and the illegality of any unions other than the communist party controlled and employer friendly all china federation of trade unions increasing numbers of employees are classified as independent contractors making them even more precarious enforced overtime well in excess of the legal maximum and employers demanding flexible working hours are brutal on chinese workers stuck in assembly jobs but lift corporate executives into ecstasy the leading culprit is headquartered in arkansas the single biggest culprit in the wholesale moving of jobs to china is to be found not in beijing but rather in bentonville arkansas yep wal mart the company that pays it employees so little that they skip meals and organize food drives receives so many government subsidies that the public pays about 1 million per store in the united states and is estimated to avoid 1 billion per year in u s taxes through its use of tax loopholes other major united states retailers began procuring clothing items from asian subcontractors before wal mart but the relentless drive to pay its suppliers as little as possible forced an acceleration in the shift of production to countries with the most exploitable populations if a manufacturer wants to continue to have contracts to supply wal mart then it has no choice but to ship its operations overseas because it has no other way to meet wal mart s demands for ever lower prices by 2012 80 percent of wal mart s suppliers were located in china and because the company is so much bigger than any other retailer it can dictate its terms gary gereffi a professor at duke university said in an interview broadcast on the pbs show frontline that no company has had the kind of economic power that wal mart does to be able to source products from around the world wal mart is able to transfer whole u s industries to overseas economies because of its size and its innovation in computerizing its inventory and tightly managing its suppliers coupled with its willingness to squeeze its suppliers to the exclusion of all other factors wal mart holds life or death power over manufacturers professor gereffi said wal mart is telling its american suppliers that they have to meet lower price standards that wal mart wants to impose the implication of that in many cases is if you re going to be able to supply wal mart at the prices wal mart wants you have to go to china or other offshore locations that would permit you to produce at lower cost wal mart s giving them the clear signal that you can t be a wal mart supplier if you can t produce at substantially lower prices you can go to china or in many cases many u s suppliers can t make that move and they just go out of business because wal mart is the dominant company for many u s suppliers if they can t go offshore those suppliers end up going out of business wal mart alone cost u s workers more than 400 000 jobs between 2001 and 2013 according to the economic policy institute that is a sizable fraction of the 3 2 million jobs that were lost in the u s due to trade relations with china to the best of my knowledge however no chinese party or government official has ever walked into the headquarters of a u s corporation pointed a gun at the ceo and demanded production be moved across the pacific ocean chinese business executives sometimes demand technology be shared in exchange for access to chinese markets a different matter but executives from the u s or elsewhere do have the option of saying no even if we were to concede that there is some coercion in regards to technology transfers there isn t when it comes to moving production that is a choice a choice routinely made in executive suites it s not a deficit for apple competitors that wish to stay in business can be compelled by capitalist competition to make that choice matching the innovation of the company that first finds moving production a way to cut costs and thus boost profitability this applies to all industries and not only low tech ones apple for example accrues massive profits by contracting out its manufacturing to subcontractors a 2010 paper by yuqing xing and neal detert found that chinese workers are paid so little that they accounted for only 6 50 of the 168 total manufacturing cost of an iphone of course iphones cost a lot more than 168 an extraordinary profit is generated for apple executives and shareholders on the backs of chinese workers a 2011 study led by kenneth l kraemer calculated that 334 out of each iphone sold at 549 went to the u s with almost the entire remainder distributed among component suppliers only 10 went to china as labor costs thus despite the export of iphones contributing heavily to the official u s trade deficit the study said the primary benefits go to the u s economy as apple continues to keep most of its product design software development product management marketing and other high wage functions in the u s chinese workers today likely account for somewhat more of the manufacturing cost as wages have risen in china over the past decade but remain minuscule compared to wages in advanced capitalist countries and the work endured is no vacation as john bellamy foster and robert w mcchesney noted in the february 2012 edition of monthly review the eighty hour plus work weeks the extreme pace of production poor food and living conditions etc constitute working conditions and a level of compensation that cannot keep labor alive if continued for many years it is therefore carried out by young workers who fall back on the land where they have use rights the most important remaining legacy of the chinese revolution for the majority of the population yet the sharp divergences between urban and rural incomes the inability of most families to prosper simply by working the land and the lack of sufficient commercial employment possibilities in the countryside all contribute to the constancy of the floating population with the continual outflow of new migrants the working conditions of china are not a secret business press commentaries can come close to celebrating such conditions a 2018 commentary in investopedia for example goes so far as to claim that manufacturing in the u s is economically unfeasible and then says this about chinese conditions manufacturers in the west are expected to comply with certain basic guidelines with regards to child labor involuntary labor health and safety norms wage and hour laws and protection of the environment chinese factories are known for not following most of these laws and guidelines even in a permissive regulatory environment chinese factories employ child labor have long shift hours and the workers are not provided with compensation insurance some factories even have policies where the workers are paid once a year a strategy to keep them from quitting before the year is out environmental protection laws are routinely ignored thus chinese factories cut down on waste management costs according to a world bank report in 2013 sixteen of the world s top twenty most polluted cities are in china the overall u s china economic picture is more balanced the components of the iphone are sourced from several countries and are assembled in china because the final product is exported from china apple contributes to trade deficits as conventionally calculated but the lion s share of the massive profits from this global supply chain are taken by apple a u s based corporation the profits from the actual assembly outsourced to foxconn are accrued in taiwan foxconn s home apple s arrangement is far from unique the list of u s companies that manufacture in china is very long if trade balances were calculated on the basis of where the profits are retained the u s deficit with china would not be nearly so imposing as a commentary in the financial times points out u s corporations sell far more goods and services in china than do chinese companies in the u s but those sales are not counted toward trade balances the commentary said in 2015 the last year for which official us statistics were available us multinational subsidiaries based in china made a total of 221 9bn in sales to domestic consumers the goods and services sold were produced by an army of 1 7m people employed by us subsidiaries in the country by contrast china s corporate presence in the us remains small official figures on chinese companies us subsidiary sales to american consumers do not exist but analysts estimate they are hardly material when compared with china s exports to the us thus the us china aggregate economic relationship appears a lot more balanced than the trade deficit makes it look a separate report by voxchina which calls itself an independent nonpartisan platform initiated by economists calculates that although the official u s trade deficit with china for 2015 was 243 billion when foreign direct investment fdi and sales by both countries companies in the other are included the deficit was only 30 billion and a u s surplus was forecast for following years the u s incidentally remains the world s second biggest exporter according to the latest world trade organization statistics the trump administration continues to make a big show of blaming china for jobs being moved across the pacific and for trade deficits but although china is opportunistic those vanishing jobs and resulting deficits are squarely the responsibility of the corporate executives who make the decision to shut down domestic operations this dynamic is part of the larger trend toward so called free trade as technology and faster transportation make moving production around the world more feasible the corporations taking advantage of these trends seek to eliminate any barriers to cross border commerce and as the race to the bottom continues as relentless competition induces a never ending search to find locations with ever lower wages and ever lower health safety labor and environmental standards what regulations remain are targets to be eliminated thus we have the specter of free trade agreements that have little to do with trade and much to do with eliminating the ability of governments to regulate and as the whip of financial markets demand ever bigger profits at any cost no corporation not even wal mart can go far enough despite being a leader in cutting wages ruthless behavior toward its employees and massive profitability when wal mart bowed to public pressure in 2015 and announced it would raise its minimum pay to 9 an hour wall street financiers angrily drove down the stock price by a third wal mart reported net income of 61 billion over the past five years so it does appear the retailer will remain a going concern apple reported net income of 246 billion over the past five years so outsourcing production to china seems to have worked out for it as well the trump administration s trade wars are so much huffing and puffing empty public rhetoric aside trump administration policy on trade consistent with its all out war on working people is to elevate corporate power nationalism is a convenient cover to obscure the most extreme anti worker u s administration yet seen class war rages on in the usual one sided manner
the american dream is alive and well in china home ownership has been called the quintessential american dream yet today less than 65 of american homes are owner occupied and more than 50 of the equity in those homes is owned by the banks compare china where despite facing one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world a whopping 90 of families can afford to own their homes over the last decade american wages have stagnated and u s productivity has consistently been outpaced by china s the u s government has responded by engaging in a trade war and imposing stiff tariffs in order to penalize china for what the white house deems unfair trade practices china s industries are said to be propped up by the state and to have significantly lower labor costs allowing them to dump cheap products on the u s market causing prices to fall and forcing u s companies out of business the message to middle america is that chinese labor costs are low because their workers are being exploited in slave like conditions at poverty level wages but if that s true how is it that the great majority of chinese families own homes according to a march 2016 article in forbes 90 of families in the country own their home giving china one of the highest home ownership rates in the world what s more is that 80 of these homes are owned outright without mortgages or any other liens on top of this north of 20 of urban households own more than one home due to their communist legacy what they get for their money is not actually ownership in perpetuity but a long term leasehold and the quality of the construction may be poor but the question posed here is how can chinese families afford the price tag for these homes in a country where the average income is only one seventh that in the united states the misleading disparity between u s and chinese incomes some commentators explain the phenomenon by pointing to cultural differences the chinese are inveterate savers with household savings rates that are more than double those in the u s and they devote as much as 74 of their money to housing under china s earlier one child policy many families had only one heir who tended to be male and home ownership was a requirement to score a wife families would therefore pool their resources to make sure their sole heir was equipped for the competition homes would be purchased either with large down payments or without financing at all financing through banks at compound interest rates doubles the cost of a typical mortgage so sidestepping the banks cuts the cost of housing in half those factors alone however cannot explain the difference in home ownership rates between the two countries the average middle class u s family could not afford to buy a home outright for their oldest heir even if they did pool their money americans would be savers if they could but they have other bills to pay and therein lies a major difference between chinese and american family wealth in china the cost of living is significantly lower the chinese government subsidizes not only its industries but its families with educational medical and transportation subsidies according to a 2017 hsbc fact sheet 70 of chinese millennials ages 19 to 36 already own their own homes american young people cannot afford to buy homes because they are saddled with student debt a millstone that now averages 37 000 per student and will be carried an average of 20 years before it is paid off a recent survey found that 80 of american workers are living paycheck to paycheck another found that 60 of u s millennials could not come up with 500 to cover their tax bills in china by contrast student debt is virtually nonexistent heavy government subsidies have made higher education cheap enough that students can work their way through college with a part time job health care is also subsidized by the government with a state run health insurance program similar to canada s the program doesn t cover everything but medical costs are still substantially lower than in the u s public transportation too is quite affordable in china and it is fast efficient and ubiquitous the disparity in incomes between american and chinese workers is misleading for other reasons the average income includes the very rich along with the poor in the u s the gap between those two classes is greater than in china the oversize incomes at the top pull the average up even worse however is the disparity in debt levels which pulls disposable income down a survey after the 2008 09 credit crisis found that household debt in the u s was 136 of household income compared with only 17 for the chinese another notable difference is that 70 of chinese family wealth comes not from salaries but from home ownership itself under communism all real property was owned by the state when deng xiaoping opened the market to private ownership families had an opportunity to get a home on reasonable terms and as new homes were built they traded up building the family asset base deng s market liberalization also gave families an income boost by allowing them to become entrepreneurs new family owned businesses sprang up aided by affordable loans cheap credit from state owned banks subsidized state affiliated industries as well quantitative easing with chinese characteristics all this was done with the help of china s federal government which in recent decades has pumped massive amounts of economic stimulus into the economy unlike the u s federal reserve s quantitative easing which went straight into big bank reserve accounts the chinese stimulus has generated new money for productive purposes including local business development and infrastructure sometimes called qualitative easing this quantitative easing with chinese characteristics has meant more jobs more gdp and more money available to spend which in turn improves quality of life the chinese government has done this without amassing a crippling federal debt or triggering runaway inflation in the last 20 years its m2 money supply has grown from just over 10 trillion yuan to 80 trillion yuan 11 6t a nearly 800 increase yet the inflation rate of its consumer price index cpi has remained low in february of this year it was just 1 5 in may it rose to 2 7 due to an outbreak of swine fever which drove pork prices up but this was a response to shortages not to an increase in the money supply radically increasing the money supply has not driven consumer prices up because gdp has increased at an even faster rate supply and demand have risen together keeping consumer prices low real estate prices on the other hand have skyrocketed 325 in the last two decades fueled by a chinese shadow banking system that is largely beyond regulatory control pundits warn that china s housing is in an unsustainable bubble that will pop but the chinese housing market is still more stable than the u s subprime market before 2008 with its no doc no down loans chinese buyers typically put 40 to 50 down on their homes and the demand for houses remains high the central bank is also taking steps to cool the market by targeting credit so that it is steered away from real estate and other existing assets and toward newly produced goods and services that central bank intervention illustrates another difference between chinese style qualitative easing and western style qe the people s bank of china is not trying to improve banking sector liquidity so that banks can make more loans chinese economists say they don t need that form of qe china s banks are already lending and the central bank has plenty of room to manipulate interest rates and control the money supply china s central bank is directing credit into the local economy because it doesn t trust the private financial market to allocate credit where local markets need it true to its name the people s bank of china seems actually to be a people s bank geared to serving the economy and the public rather than just the banks themselves time for more qe in early april president trump said in one of his many criticisms of the u s central bank that he thought the fed should be doing more quantitative easing expanding the money supply rather than quantitative tightening shrinking the money supply commentators were left scratching their heads because the official u s unemployment rate is considered to be low but more qe could be a good idea if it were done as chinese style qualitative easing a form of monetary expansion that would allow congress to relieve medical and educational costs grant cheap credit to states to upgrade their roads and mass transit and support local businesses could go a long way toward making american workers competitive with chinese workers unlike the u s government the chinese government supports its workers and its industries rather than penalizing china for that unfair trade practice perhaps the u s government should try doing the same china s legacy is socialist and after opening to international trade it has continued to serve the collective good particularly of its workers meanwhile the u s model has been regressing into feudalism with workers driven into slave like conditions through debt in the 21st century it is time to upgrade our economic model from one of feudal exploitation to a cooperative

quantitative easing explained main talking points with interest rates near zero the federal reserve ventured another policy tool in quantitative easing after years of qe the bank of japan has experienced diminishing economic and financial returns similarly the ecb has engaged in long term refinancing operations ltros as a form of quantitative easing but their effectiveness remains in question how does quantitative easing work quantitative easing referred to as qe is a monetary policy tool typically used by central banks to stimulate their domestic economy when more traditional methods are spent the central bank buys securities most frequently government bonds from its member banks effectively increasing the supply of money in the economy with increased supply the cost of money is reduced which makes it cheaper for businesses to borrow money to use for expansion this has a similar effect to the standard interest short term interest rate cuts that central banks employ but depending on what they purchase such efforts can lower the cost for significantly longer loans that could more directly influence lending for homes autos and small businesses the federal reserve bank fed quantitative easing policy as the central bank of the united states the federal reserve has a duty to provide the nation with a safer flexible and more stable monetary and financial system that is often boiled down into a stated dual mandate of steady inflation and low unemployment in pursuit of these objectives the fed is allotted a series of monetary policy tools that allow it to influence the us dollar and the money supply in the country while raising and lowering the federal funds rate is the most widely known tool the central bank s balance sheet has become one of heightened importance and investor interest federal reserve bank total assets source fred simply put the fed s balance sheet is the same as any other balance sheet in the fed s case it records the collection of distinct assets and liabilities across all the federal reserve bank branches the bank can use these assets and liabilities as an unconventional or supplementary monetary policy tool particularly when interest rates are already low and confer limited potential with further policy efforts in 2008 as the united states economy entered a recession amid the great financial crisis the federal reserve announced a series of interest rate cuts as a typical expansionary tool the cuts were intended to spur spending thereby improving the economy however even with interest rates near zero economic recovery failed to take hold then in november 2008 the federal reserve announced its initial round of quantitative easing popularly known as qe1 the announcement saw the fed massively shift its standard market operations as it began to purchase significant amounts of treasury bills notes and bonds along with asset and mortgage backed securities of high quality the purchases effectively increased the supply of money in the us economy and made access to capital less expensive the buying program lasted from december 2008 to march 2010 and was accompanied by another cut to the fed funds rate resulting in a new range of 0 to 0 25 interest change in fed balance sheet due to quantitative easing source bloomberg with the federal funds rate near 0 and not willing to explore negative rates at the time the central bank had effectively expended all its expansionary monetary policy tools thus quantitative easing became an important part of the central bank s toolbox to boost economic growth and right the capsized ship that was the us economy to further aid recovery the fed pursued subsequent rounds of quantitative easing now known as qe2 from november 2010 to june 2011 and qe3 from september 2012 to december 2013 the purchase programs targeted similar assets and helped to prop up perceived growth as well as capital markets as a side effect in the us until the central bank finally reversed course by raising its benchmark rate for the first time in december 2015 view our free quarterly forecasts for the us dollar euro dow jones and more having already started to reduce its balance sheet in 2018 we have seen debate over a sustained quantitative tightening reducing the balance sheet pop up in 2019 many federal reserve officials have supported the slow drawdown of the bank s balance sheet and advocated for further normalization as the us economy boasts over a decade of economic expansion however uneven growth and external risks like trade wars have complicated the issue of this exceptional support the bank of japan boj quantitative easing policy japan s central bank is another financial institution that has employed the use of quantitative easing but with varying degrees of success one of the first instances occurred between october 1997 and october 1998 when the boj purchased trillions in yen of commercial paper in an attempt to help banks through a period of low growth low interest rates and trouble from bad bank loans however growth remained subdued view our economic calendar for data releases and live event times in light of the underwhelming impact the bank of japan increased asset purchases between march 2001 and december 2004 this round of purchases targeted long term government bonds and injected 35 5 trillion yen in liquidity to japanese banks while the purchases were moderately effective the purchase of long term government bonds suppressed asset yields and at the advent of the great financial crisis japan s growth vanished once again since then the bank of japan has conducted numerous rounds of qe and qualitative monetary easing qqe all of which were largely ineffective as the country struggles with low economic growth despite a negative interest rate environment source bloomberg today the bank of japan has branched out to other forms of asset purchases with varying degrees of quality alongside previous purchases of commercial paper the bank has built up considerable ownership of the country s exchange traded fund etf market and japanese real estate investment trusts or j reits source bloomberg the boj began etf purchases in 2010 and as of 2q 2018 owned roughly 70 of the total japanese etf market further these broad purchases have made the central bank a majority shareholder in over 40 of all public japanese corporations according to bloomberg thus the quality and credit rating of these holdings by the central bank are fundamentally weaker than that of a government issued assets like japanese government bonds jgbs and differ considerably from holdings of the federal reserve the bank of england boe quantitative easing policy like the previously mentioned central banks the boe has amassed large sums of local government bonds gilts and corporate bonds through its own quantitative easing the policy was pursued to bolster the uk s economy during the height of the global recession which would eventually carry over to the added risk of political risks from a scottish referendum vote general election and eventually the brexit at the same time the bank has increased its overnight lending rate slowly source bloomberg in contrast to its american and japanese counterparts the overall holdings of the uk s central bank are significantly smaller when compared to national gdp the bank of england s holdings amount to a mere 5 7 in early 2019 paling in comparison to japan s holdings that equate to more than 100 of gdp the relatively small holdings may allow the bank to act more effectively in the future as the diminishing returns of qe have yet to take hold source bloomberg at present the efficacy of the boe s quantitative easing strategy appears to top that of the boj and fall inline with that of the federal reserve as the uncertainties of brexit persist the bank may decide to maintain its safety net or perhaps even further its monetary policy measures that being said the bank would remain far less committed to quantitative easing than its neighbor the european central bank view our brexit timeline to see the process of events leading up to the present situation for the united kingdom and european union s relationship the european central bank ecb quantitative easing policy the ecb is another major central bank that has pursued quantitative easing as an expansionary tool though its foray into the now conventional qe came significantly latter than the fed s in its most recent round of easing the european central bank spent nearly 3 trillion buying government bonds and corporate debt along with asset backed securities and covered bonds the purchases were conducted from march 2015 to december 2018 in an effort to avoid sub zero inflation from plaguing the european bloc which was still in recovery from the dual scourge of the global recession and then the eurozone debt crisis according to reuters the purchases came at a pace of 1 3 million euros a minute equating to 7 600 euros per person in the bloc source bloomberg like japan the ecb s easing rounds proved rather ineffective in early 2019 the bank announced another round of easing through targeted long term refinancing operations or tltros just months after the end of its opened ended qe program and as interest rates remain at 0 tltros provide an injection of low interest rate funding to banks in the eurozone in an effort to provide greater bank liquidity and lower sovereign debt yields the loans carry a maturity of one to four years source bloomberg tltros aim to stabilize the balance sheet of private banks and their liquidity ratio a stronger liquidity ratio allows the bank to lend more readily which in turn pushes down interest rates and should allow for inflation however years of monetary stimulus can see diminishing returns and have negative implications negative effects of qe balance sheet use and diminishing returns while qe proved fruitful for the federal reserve and the united states the monetary policy tool has proved less effective for the central banks of japan and europe and has even contributed some negative consequences for the japanese economy years of expansionary policy has resulted in deflation and the bank s balance sheet now carries more value than the gdp of the country further its large share of ownership of the etf jriet and government bond market may put it at heightened risk in the eventuality of an economic downturn despite numerous rounds of stimulus and negative interest rates economic growth has failed to take hold and the japanese central bank is wading into unknown monetary policy territory similarly the ecb has seen its own form of quantitative easing exert less influence over the european economy as inflation and growth remain muted in the bloc the impact of quantitative easing on currencies fundamentally the use of quantitative easing increases the supply of a currency according to the commanding principles of supply and demand such a change should result in the price of that currency decreasing however as currencies are traded in pairs the resulting weakness in one currency is relative to its counterpart with the current monetary policy climate trending toward flush supply and dovish tones few currencies herald absolute strength that said strength has recently been garnered through an almost best of the rest mentality in which a dovish shift from one central bank is followed shortly thereafter with dovishness from another bank such subtle competitive policies can turn more aggressive resulting in what is termed a currency war source bloomberg consequently the global supply of money has ballooned while the relative value of currencies remains in flux in the current monetary policy climate differences in approach have largely become a comparison in dovishness among the major central banks few stand on the hawkish side of policy and fewer still have plans to raise their central interest rate instead officials have resorted to rounds of capital injection as quantitative easing appears to be gaining popularity as a monetary policy tool though whether it remains as a permanent one

the troublesome relationship between tariffs trade deficits and the tenuous economic recovery would a smaller trade deficit make the u s economy stronger the question is only a portion of the contentious debate over u s tariffs on chinese imports economic theory and existing empirical evidence strongly indicate that tariffs do not in general create the conditions for faster economic growth escalating trade wars are the stuff that global slumps are made of cautions the june 2019 ucla anderson forecast report signs of trade friction cropping up in other economic data and the potential for more friction are in part behind the forecast s increased probabilities of a u s recession in the next three years versus previous outlooks while trade wars are nearly universally disfavored in the community of established economists trade deficits generate a healthy and respectful debate among experts should economic policy focus on reducing the trade deficit to fund the ballooning federal budget deficit the u s actually requires a similar trade deficit otherwise the government s need for cash would potentially crowd out investment elsewhere in our economy policymakers have to consider this financial imperative against security in some cases should the u s be reliant on foreign producers for crucial products and commodities also globalization s impact on jobs and wages has become a part of the debate over tariffs and trade deficit reduction but tariffs do have economic consequences at home that are counterproductive to economic growth including disruption of supply chains yes replacement suppliers can usually be established over time in nations not affected by tariffs but these arrangements take time and are often less efficient this warning is illustrated in an article by ucla economist william wu and forecast director jerry nickelsburg included in the latest quarterly forecast report a study of recent trade flows shows how the trade war with china has dramatically dropped imports from there but has done little to reduce the overall trade deficit the table below shows how other u s trading partners have picked up business china lost comparing the first quarter of 2019 to the same in 2018 we see that the u s imported more goods this year than last from all of its major trading partners except china and canada the european union became the u s s biggest trading partner widening the trade deficit between the two in its favor several countries that sell more to the u s than they buy including japan vietnam and south korea also increased trade here during the study period the fluctuations in trade with these countries largely reflect u s company attempts to use suppliers in places where new tariffs won t add costs but the disruption to supply chains like the addition of tariffs on the hundreds of billions of dollars of goods still imported from china are costs that companies will pass on to customers the forecast warns regardless of where the u s trade deficit emerges from tariffs aimed at narrowing it will increase prices for goods sold to americans meanwhile other side effects of tariffs work to boost the trade deficit rather than lower it the findings suggest the trade disputes have sent the value of the dollar up sharply against the chinese yuan the study notes for china this change offsets the pain of new tariffs by making chinese products less expensive in comparison to u s goods it s one reason the u s trade deficit with china grew in april despite tariffs the effects cited in the forecast have only grown the researchers note that the first quarter on which the report is based ended before the latest escalation of the trade dispute in may and june president trump greatly expanded the china tariffs and added the european union canada and mexico as real or potential targets for higher tariffs retaliation higher tariffs on u s exports by target countries and their friends is ongoing unfortunately the fastest way to reduce the trade deficit is for all of america which includes government as well as individuals and companies to stop spending so much harvard economist martin feldstein a former chairman of the council of economic advisers explained why in a paper titled inconvenient truths about the u s trade deficit feldstein died on june 11 2019 the u s trade deficit as the forecast notes is not defined by the level of trade with individual countries instead the trade imbalance reflects the fact that americans consume more than they produce the only way to do that is to import the difference there s a financial side to the trade deficit too carrying a trade deficit is useful when a country wants to avoid raising taxes or cutting budgets to fund government spending the u s budget deficit hit 873 billion in fiscal 2018 and is expected to reach 1 02 trillion this year according to the forecast assuming last year s tax cuts stick the forecast puts that figure at 1 1 trillion by 2021 that deficit must be financed in the same way a mortgage lender is necessary to make up the difference between what a home buyer can pay at the time of purchase and the amount the seller demands right now the u s trade deficit is a big help in financing the government budget deficit the forecast notes a significant part of america s chronic trade deficit is the result of foreigners buying u s government debt as well as u s stocks real estate companies and other assets if the overall amount of foreign investment here declines the cost of funding the government debt rises less demand for its bonds means it would have to pay higher interest rates to sell them higher interest rates would discourage spending by u s consumers and businesses feldstein explained higher interest rates make home mortgages and business lines of credit more expensive feldstein made clear that americans have the power to lower the trade deficit at will by saving more than they invest but would a lower trade deficit drop unemployment increase incomes or otherwise enhance the u s economy thriftiness is the last thing the u s economy needs right now the core economy is growing at a not very reassuring 1 2 percent according to the forecast at less than 1 percent growth which is a good possibility if austerity catches on the risk of a recession late in 2020 becomes very real according to the study the inconvenient truth this time that a reduction in the trade deficit could very well come with economic consequences no one wants

home ownership has been called the quintessential american dream yet today less than 65 of american homes are owner occupied and more than 50 of the equity in those homes is owned by the banks compare china where despite facing one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world a whopping 90 of families can afford to own their homes over the last decade american wages have stagnated and u s productivity has consistently been outpaced by china s the u s government has responded by engaging in a trade war and imposing stiff tariffs in order to penalize china for what the white house deems unfair trade practices china s industries are said to be propped up by the state and to have significantly lower labor costs allowing them to dump cheap products on the u s market causing prices to fall and forcing u s companies out of business the message to middle america is that chinese labor costs are low because their workers are being exploited in slave like conditions at poverty level wages but if that s true how is it that the great majority of chinese families own homes according to a march 2016 article in forbes 90 of families in the country own their home giving china one of the highest home ownership rates in the world what s more is that 80 of these homes are owned outright without mortgages or any other liens on top of this north of 20 of urban households own more than one home due to their communist legacy what chinese buyers get for their money is not actually ownership in perpetuity but a long term leasehold and the quality of the construction may be poor but the question posed here is how can chinese families afford the price tag for these homes in a country where the average income is only one seventh that in the united states the misleading disparity between u s and chinese incomes some commentators explain the phenomenon by pointing to cultural differences the chinese are inveterate savers with household savings rates that are more than double those in the u s and they devote as much as 74 of their money to housing under china s earlier one child policy many families had only one heir who tended to be male and home ownership was a requirement to score a wife families would therefore pool their resources to make sure their sole heir was equipped for the competition homes would be purchased either with large down payments or without financing at all financing through banks at compound interest rates doubles the cost of a typical mortgage so sidestepping the banks cuts the cost of housing in half those factors alone however cannot explain the difference in home ownership rates between the two countries the average middle class u s family could not afford to buy a home outright for their oldest heir even if they did pool their money americans would be savers if they could but they have other bills to pay and therein lies a major difference between chinese and american family wealth in china the cost of living is significantly lower the chinese government subsidizes not only its industries but its families with educational medical and transportation subsidies according to a 2017 hsbc fact sheet 70 of chinese millennials ages 19 to 36 already own their own homes american young people cannot afford to buy homes because they are saddled with student debt a millstone that now averages 37 000 per student and will be carried an average of 20 years before it is paid off a recent survey found that 80 of american workers are living paycheck to paycheck another found that 60 of u s millennials could not come up with 500 to cover their tax bills in china by contrast student debt is virtually nonexistent heavy government subsidies have made higher education cheap enough that students can work their way through college with a part time job health care is also subsidized by the government with a state run health insurance program similar to canada s the program doesn t cover everything but medical costs are still substantially lower than in the u s public transportation too is quite affordable in china and it is fast efficient and ubiquitous the disparity in incomes between american and chinese workers is misleading for other reasons the average income includes the very rich along with the poor in the u s the gap between those two classes is greater than in china the oversize incomes at the top pull the average up even worse however is the disparity in debt levels which pulls disposable income down a survey after the 2008 09 credit crisis found that household debt in the u s was 136 of household income compared with only 17 for the chinese another notable difference is that 70 of chinese family wealth comes not from salaries but from home ownership itself under communism all real property was owned by the state when deng xiaoping opened the market to private ownership families had an opportunity to get a home on reasonable terms and as new homes were built they traded up building the family asset base deng s market liberalization also gave families an income boost by allowing them to become entrepreneurs new family owned businesses sprang up aided by affordable loans cheap credit from state owned banks subsidized state affiliated industries as well quantitative easing with chinese characteristics all this was done with the help of china s federal government which in recent decades has pumped massive amounts of economic stimulus into the economy unlike the u s federal reserve s quantitative easing which went straight into big bank reserve accounts the chinese stimulus has generated new money for productive purposes including local business development and infrastructure sometimes called qualitative easing this quantitative easing with chinese characteristics has meant more jobs more gdp and more money available to spend which in turn improves quality of life the chinese government has done this without amassing a crippling federal debt or triggering runaway inflation in the last 20 years its m2 money supply has grown from just over 10 trillion yuan to 80 trillion yuan 11 6t a nearly 800 increase yet the inflation rate of its consumer price index cpi has remained low in february of this year it was just 1 5 in may it rose to 2 7 due to an outbreak of swine fever which drove pork prices up but this was a response to shortages not to an increase in the money supply radically increasing the money supply has not driven consumer prices up because gdp has increased at an even faster rate supply and demand have risen together keeping consumer prices low real estate prices on the other hand have skyrocketed 325 in the last two decades fueled by a chinese shadow banking system that is largely beyond regulatory control pundits warn that china s housing is in an unsustainable bubble that will pop but the chinese housing market is still more stable than the u s subprime market before 2008 with its no doc no down loans chinese buyers typically put 40 to 50 down on their homes and the demand for houses remains high the central bank is also taking steps to cool the market by targeting credit so that it is steered away from real estate and other existing assets and toward newly produced goods and services that central bank intervention illustrates another difference between chinese style qualitative easing and western style qe the people s bank of china is not trying to improve banking sector liquidity so that banks can make more loans chinese economists say they don t need that form of qe china s banks are already lending and the central bank has plenty of room to manipulate interest rates and control the money supply china s central bank is directing credit into the local economy because it doesn t trust the private financial market to allocate credit where local markets need it true to its name the people s bank of china seems actually to be a people s bank geared to serving the economy and the public rather than just the banks themselves time for more qe in early april president trump said in one of his many criticisms of the u s central bank that he thought the fed should be doing more quantitative easing expanding the money supply rather than quantitative tightening shrinking the money supply commentators were left scratching their heads because the official u s unemployment rate is considered to be low but more qe could be a good idea if it were done as chinese style qualitative easing a form of monetary expansion that would allow congress to relieve medical and educational costs grant cheap credit to states to upgrade their roads and mass transit and support local businesses could go a long way toward making american workers competitive with chinese workers unlike the u s government the chinese government supports its workers and its industries rather than penalizing china for that unfair trade practice perhaps the u s government should try doing the same china s legacy is socialist and after opening to international trade it has continued to serve the collective good particularly of its workers meanwhile the u s model has been regressing into feudalism with workers driven into slave like conditions through debt in the 21st century it is time to upgrade our economic model from one of feudal exploitation to a cooperative democracy that recognizes the needs

for the first time in nearly 30 years the chinese central bank and the banking regulatory commission announced it would take control of one of its banks the troubled mongolia based baoshang bank had assets of 576 billion yuan 84 billion and its seizure is indicative of the deteriorating health of small scale banks mostly in rural areas and in smaller cities as china s economy slows the turmoil surrounding its conservatorship has led interbank lending rates to spike forcing the bank of china to inject billions of yuan to quell the fear of systemic contagion for years china s regional banks have used shadow financing to obfuscate their exposure to precarious borrowers while china has made an effort to rein in shadow banking activity this is the first time in decades that regulators have assumed control of a bank in this way in 2015 and 2016 they recapitalized lenders and merged stronger banks with weaker ones but these restructuring efforts were disorganized inadequate and didn t address the main issue at hand insolvency according to data compiled by bloomberg for the first four months of the year companies defaulted on 39 2 billion yuan 5 8 billion of domestic bonds this is 3 4 times the total for the same period during 2018 with the solvency issues plaguing the smaller banks and the rise in defaults it is becoming evident that funding needs for china s major commercial banks are becoming intractable for beijing the pboc is running low on the u s dollars it needs for activities both at home and abroad in 2013 china s four largest commercial banks had around 125 billion more worth of dollar assets than liabilities but today they owe more dollars to creditors and customers than are owed to them making things even worse for the chinese banking system is that its problems extend beyond mainland china there is a looming banking crisis in hong kong as well hong kong pegs its currency to the us dollar and therefore has been overaccommodative with their monetary policy since 2008 this has led to a massive bubble in real estate hayman capital s kyle bass believes hong kong is reminiscent of iceland ireland and cyprus whose banking systems imploded during the european banking crisis the commonality was that each country had allowed their banking sectors to grow to almost 1 000 of gdp leaving them vulnerable to the smallest economic hiccup bass believes that hong kong is in a similar situation with its banking system sitting as one of the most levered in the world at approximately 850 of gdp with 280 of gdp being lent directly into mainland china mainland china would be directly on the hook for hong kong s failure as the two largest banks in that nation standard chartered and hsbc were once filled with british depositors but now have mostly chinese obligations china s government has operated its economy much like a ponzi scheme it has been stimulating growth by printing money and issuing debt since the year 2000 this is much the same throughout the developed world but this practice has been on steroids in since 2009 for example m2 money supply in has skyrocketed by over 133 trillion chinese yuan nearly 20 trillion during that timeframe but during that same period china s annual gdp grew by approximately only 8 4 trillion proving much of that debt issuance was of the non productive variety therefore it takes an ever increasing supply of new money and debt to grow its economy and continue the economic charade china is in the midst of one of the largest financial bubbles in modern history the ratio of banking assets to gdp is much higher than the us at the top of the housing bubble and higher than the eu right before its sovereign debt crisis in 2012 still there are many in the market who believe that with the impressive 3 2 trillion pile of foreign exchange fx reserves held by china nothing can go wrong those people should note that that figure was 4 0 trillion not long ago and is currently declining at a rate of 100 billion per month kyle bass notes that china needs 2 7 trillion of required minimum reserves just to keep trade functioning properly thus making that fx safety cushion a lot narrower china is just now experiencing cracks in its banking system that will test their newly established deposit insurance system making a run on the banks a real possibility for the chinese government to save the banks it may have to destroy their currency in the process as it stands right now the yuan is getting close to breaking the all important 7 per dollar key psychological level if this level is indeed breached you may see a massive flight of capital out of the chinese yuan therefore the government is forced to continuously issue a massive amount of new currency and debt to keep the economic mirage in place yet at the same time must find a way to keep its currency afloat this is the achilles heel of china s communist command and control economic model and it is negatively affecting the yuan s purchasing power consumer prices in may increased by the most in 15 months while food inflation spiked 7 7 year over year will the conservatorship of baoshang bank be the event that finally unravels their banking system s potemkin chinese wall of solvency that still is not clear but with each new iteration of stimulus the yuan weakens even against other currency manipulators like the fed and ecb very few investors thought back in july of 2008 that indybank was the canary in the coal mine which gave an advanced warning regarding the insolvency of much of the us financial system at the time of the bank s failure fdic chair sheila bair assured markets not to worry and that its failure was well within the range of what they could handle fed chair ben bernanke also gave assurances that the incipient subprime mortgage crisis was completely contained it wouldn t be until later that year when investors realized the full extent of the banking crisis that led to the conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac and the collapse of lehman brothers the takeover of washington mutual in september of 2008 and soon thereafter the near collapse of the entire global economy given that china s total debt has quadrupled in the past twelve years a feat that is absolutely unapparelled in history it wouldn t be surprising if the collapse of baoshang bank forebodes the same fate for china s economy as indybank did for the united states
central bank meetings will be front and centre next week as the federal reserve bank of england and bank of japan convene for their policy decisions the fed will likely grab the most attention amid intensifying expectations of a rate cut in terms of data releases the main focus will be on inflation as canada the eurozone japan and the united kingdom report for the month of may flash pmis out of the eurozone will be important too so will q1 gdp figures from new zealand fed could flag a rate cut the fed will be the first of the three central banks to make its policy announcement next week and is expected to keep the fed funds rate unchanged at the target range of 2 25 2 50 but with markets convinced that a rate cut at the following meeting in july is a foregone conclusion traders could be disappointed if the fed falls short of giving outright signals of lower borrowing costs the fed will publish updated economic projections on wednesday but with most fomc members having so far only gone as far as suggesting they are open to rate cuts it will be fascinating to see how many committee members will predict a rate cut in their projections in the previous projections the fed had sharply lowered its median forecasts for interest rates but was still anticipating some tightening over the next couple of years it s more than possible therefore that the median projection in june will be for only a modest cut in rates which would risk triggering a major upside correction for the bearish looking dollar worse it could cause a major market upset sending stocks spiralling downwards thus fed chief jerome powell will have a tough challenge in sounding dovish enough to please the markets without promising as many cuts as investors are pricing currently with the fed meeting grabbing all the limelight next week us releases will probably struggle for attention manufacturing activity gauges for june will come into focus over the next few days the empire state manufacturing index is due on monday with the philly fed manufacturing index coming up next on thursday and the ihs markit flash manufacturing pmi on friday housing data will also be plenty building permits and housing starts are out on tuesday followed by existing home sales on friday boj to maintain course as outlook worsens the bank of japan will announce its policy decision a few hours after the fed on thursday unlike in the united states where interest rates are comfortably above 0 the boj has limited room to cut even though it may need to as japanese exports have taken a big hit from trump s trade war and inflation is still nowhere near the 2 target investors will be able to gauge how exports and inflation performed in may on wednesday and friday respectively however even if the data surprises and shows some easing in the annual decline in exports and core cpi which strengthened to 0 9 y y in april rises further they re unlikely to be significant enough to alter the boj s view that the risks to both growth and inflation remain skewed to the downside but while the boj will probably stress the negative risks to the economy in its statement and reiterate its willingness to expand its stimulus program if required policymakers are unlikely to take any action next week nor commit to any changes in policy in the near future boj governor haruhiko kuroda recently signalled the policy rate could be cut below the current 0 1 but didn t see the need to do so just yet the absence of fresh policy direction by the boj can only mean the yen will continue to be driven by market sentiment and unless there s any positive developments on the trade front the safe haven currency is expected to stay in strong demand over the coming weeks new zealand to report q1 gdp the reserve bank of new zealand was the first of the major central banks to cut interest rates lowering its cash rate by 0 25 in may however all the indications are that the rbnz is not in a hurry to ease again and with rate cut expectations for the fed surging in recent week the local dollar appreciated against its us counterpart before coming under pressure in the past week from the dip in risk appetite next week s gdp estimates for the first quarter due on thursday will be watched closely as any unexpected weakness in economic growth would fuel speculation that the rbnz will deliver another cut before the year end it s been a similar story for the australian dollar which saw limited downside from an rba rate cut due to a weaker us dollar before being weighed down from the latest bout of risk aversion however investors are a little more certain of additional rate cuts from the reserve bank of australia and will therefore be scrutinizing the bank s june meeting minutes on tuesday for more clues loonie looks to inflation and retail sales data for further upside the canadian dollar finally managed to halt its year to date slide against the greenback in june as us data disappointed while canadian indicators fared much better in comparison next week s releases could further help shift sentiment for the loonie as may inflation figures are due on wednesday and april retail sales follow on friday with investors pricing about a 70 probability of a bank of canada rate cut by december the loonie could stretch its rebound versus the dollar if the numbers are strong enough to cast doubt on boc rate cut prospects bank of england only hawk in the room the bank of england will be the last of the central bank meetings next week announcing its policy decision on thursday after the boj and the norges bank but ahead of that uk data will draw traders attention amid growing concerns that the british economy is finally starting to feel some real pain from the chaos and uncertainty inflicted by brexit uk inflation numbers are out on thursday and are expected to show the headline rate nudging down to 2 0 year on year in may retail sales will follow on thursday and will be very important given that domestic consumption is the main driver of uk growth retail sales were flat in april and the absence of a pickup in may would not send out very positive signals about the uk economy despite the growth worries however and the rising risks of a no deal brexit the boe is sticking to its central projection that some tightening in monetary policy will be needed over the next 2 3 years with no press conference or quarterly forecasts scheduled for the june meeting the boe is widely anticipated to repeat the same message in its statement markets aren t convinced by this hawkish talk however and so the impact on the pound of the boe being the only major central bank that s outright flagging a rate increase hasn t been too significant eurozone pmis to steady in june as the european central bank keeps its options open for a possible loosening in monetary policy the flash eurozone pmis for june will come under the radar on friday before that though the final reading of may cpi is out on tuesday along with germany s zew economic sentiment index for june as trade frictions stay elevated morale among germany s export heavy businesses is taking a knock and the zew economic sentiment index is predicted to decline to 5 0 in june from 2 1 previously ihs markit s pmis paint a somewhat steadier picture however with the euro area s composite pmi hovering in the 51 5 52 0 region in recent months the flash pmi prints for june are forecast to show a small improvement in both manufacturing and services activity the euro is likely to be sensitive to any big surprises in the pmi numbers as the ecb ponders what its next move should be
china s economy flashed more warning signs in may as the united states ramped up trade pressure with industrial output growth unexpectedly slowing to a more than 17 year low and investment cooling underlining a need for more stimulus despite a slew of support measures since last year china s economy is still struggling to get back on firmer footing and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world s two largest economies could trigger a global recession industrial output grew 5 0 per cent in may from a year earlier data from the national bureau of statistics showed on friday missing analysts expectations of 5 5 per cent and well below april s 5 4 per cent the reading was the weakest since early 2002 and exports were a major drag showing only marginal growth fixed assets investment also grew less than expected reinforcing expectations that beijing will need to roll out more growth measures soon vice premier liu he on thursday stoked expectations of more stimulus as the us china trade dispute intensifies urging regulators to do more to boost the economy and saying beijing has plenty of policy tools it can use fiscal policy measures could step up and there should be more structural and targeted easing in monetary policy said wang jun beijing based chief economist at zhongyuan bank it s necessary to cut reserve requirement ratios rrrs but we should be a bit cautious in cutting benchmark interest rates real estate investment a key economic driver also showed signs of fatigue with constructions starts slowing markedly and property sales falling the most since october 2017 the slowdown in the real estate sector is concerning we really need to keep an eye on its negative impact on growth economists at anz said in a note to clients trimming its 2019 growth forecast for china to 6 2 per cent and 6 per cent for 2020 anz expects the central bank to cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr by another 100 basis points bps this year and cut the 7 day reverse repo rate by 5 bps in the third quarter the people s bank of china pboc has already cut rrr six times since early 2018 to free up more money for banks to lend it has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower however despite the worsening trade outlook china watchers appear divided over whether the central bank will cut benchmark interest rates as it repeatedly did in past downturns analysts believe policymakers are concerned that more aggressive easing could fuel debt risks and put more pressure on the yuan which is weakening towards the psychologically important 7 per dollar level last seen during the global financial crisis beijing has relied more on fiscal stimulus to weather the latest downturn including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies but friday s data suggested domestic demand remains sluggish adding to weaker than expected import and bank lending data over the last week and gloomy may factory surveys power generation last month grew just 0 2 per cent analysts say china is readying itself for a prolonged trade dispute after both sides raised tariffs on each other s goods last month and us president donald trump threatened more but some investors are still holding out hope that trump will meet chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month and at least agree to suspend further escalations similar to a truce they reached at december s g20 in argentina investment disappoints the latest readings on china s economy also showed fixed assets investment growth decelerated to 5 6 per cent in january may from the same period a year earlier analysts had expected it to remain unchanged from 6 1 per cent in the first four months of the year private sector fixed assets investment which accounts for about 60 per cent of total investment in china also lost momentum it rose 5 3 per cent compared with a 5 5 per cent rise in the first four months of the year the pboc has repeatedly urged state controlled banks to keep lending to cash strapped smaller private firms at lower rates even if they are facing short term financial difficulty but average rates for companies and home buyers edged back up in the first quarter infrastructure investment grew 4 0 per cent moderating from 4 4 per cent while construction has picked up as beijing ramps up spending on road rail and port projects some analysts have been puzzled by the slower than expected response on monday china announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility on special bonds so they can increase infrastructure spending property investment rose 9 5 per cent in may on year the slowest pace so far this year retail sales retail sales bucked the downbeat trend rising 8 6 per cent in may from a year earlier and picking up from a 7 2 per cent rise in april which was a 16 year low analysts surveyed by reuters had expected a rebound to 8 1 per cent but some said it was likely due to higher inflation rather than any turnaround in weak consumer confidence earlier this week china s auto association reported the worst ever monthly drop in sales in the world s biggest vehicle market in may as the economy slowed and provinces implemented tougher emission standards
shi yu china daily dashing hopes of a quick agreement on trade relations with china the us administration imposed punitive tariffs on another 200 billion of chinese goods now that the chinese government has responded with new tariffs on 60 billion of us products the united states is threatening tariffs targeting yet another 300 billion of chinese imports both sides are now digging in for a long fight largely because americans have yet to feel the pain of the white house s policies china understood the us administration s transaction style some time ago but it only recently began to appreciate fully the significance of the white house s america first policy which according to us state department policy director kiron skinner rests on four pillars national sovereignty reciprocity burden sharing and regional partnerships national sovereignty and reciprocity are standard features of any country s foreign policy they form the foundations of the 1648 peace of westphalia which recognized after the thirty years war that sovereign states have their own interests to defend and must engage with other states on a reciprocal basis us undercuts interests of even its closest allies but washington often takes reciprocity too far weakening the us capacity to build and maintain partnerships regional or otherwise indeed the incumbent us administration has undercut the interests of its closest allies for its own narrow benefit even threatening to impose broad tariffs on automobile and auto part imports from the european union japan and the republic of korea claiming that they pose a national security threat in any case the active ingredient of the white house doctrine is burden sharing skinner interprets this narrowly focusing on the need for the us nato allies to increase their defense spending what she does not acknowledge is that the us is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural savings deficit the us consistently runs both a fiscal deficit with total expenditure of which defense comprised 14 8 percent in 2017 significantly exceeding its income and a current account deficit if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of over 3 percent of gdp per annum net us debt to the rest of the world currently at 40 percent of gdp will double in less than 24 years washington barking up the wrong tree the us administration insists that the only deficit to worry about is the bilateral trade deficit with china but even if china bowed to us demands and eliminated the bilateral deficit america s imbalance of savings and investment would merely shift its external deficit like water in a squeezed balloon toward other surplus economies such as the eu japan and the rok the targets of the threatened automotive tariffs for decades the us savings shortfall seemed like a problem to be managed not solved since the us started running structural deficits in the 1970s there has been a kind of global grand bargain on the issue the world willingly finances america s current account deficit in us dollars in exchange the us acts as a guarantor of free trade and global security the white house doctrine upends that bargain by

excessive debts with tax increases spending cuts higher inflation with negative real interest rates or in the case of the roman empire conquest of creditors it seems to be politically impossible for the us government to raise taxes domestically so it has found a workaround tariff increases end up serving effectively as consumption taxes but because they can be blamed on foreigners they are more palatable to the american public from the white house s perspective the costs of this approach appear low with the us economy still growing stock markets at record highs and unemployment at record lows jpmorgan has estimated that the trade war s direct costs will amount to just 0 2 percent of gdp for the us 0 4 percent of gdp for china and 0 22 percent of gdp for the rest of the world through

2007 to 2017 it has since reduced that total by 391 billion historically low interest rates and liquidity inflated asset bubbles financed the fiscal deficit and enabled the household sector to

a brief history of doom two hundred years of financial crises by richard vague advertisement university of pennsylvania press 228 pp 29 95 reviewed by joseph n distefano is economics science if so why is there so much confusion over the basic causes and effects of prosperity and decline richard vague the mass marketing mogul turned philadelphia investor philanthropist policy scholar convened a team of researchers to measure economic downturns in the united states and the largest countries of western europe and east asia and found a pattern you might not recognize from college textbooks or cable tv debates private debt consumer and business borrowing tends to surge before economic decline it s not a unique view vague notes the economist hyman minsky who died in 1996 made similar observations about overlending and recession but the mainstream of american economists and other moralizers for example ex federal reserve chief alan greenspan in his recent book capitalism in america have tended to treat private debt explosions and bankruptcies that bring real life pain to millions as mere symptoms resulting from higher level problems these include changes in the money supply whether based on gold or central bank fiat bad leader policies like high tariffs or too many wars or natural variations in credit supply and demand vague s boom and bust chapters sketch the jazz age housing and stock credit boom that fed america s great depression of the 1930s which left a third of u s homeowners behind on their loans and closed 40 percent of u s banks the leveraged buyout craze that blew up in the 1980s s l crisis japan s real estate bubble economy and its long slow recovery the anglo american speculative financing crisis of the mid 1800s the late 1800s epic of railroad overbuilding and finally the 2008 financial crisis fed by shaky mortgage finance so who persuades these hopeful families and those sober business owners to over borrow vague and his crew identify a relentless personal and business credit cycle that passes through stages of scarcity sobriety and sustained prosperity before exploding and repeating left to their own devices groups of banks and other lenders can be counted on to encourage developers homebuyers and businesses to borrow higher riskier and for the lender more lucrative sums they overbuild industries and communities they do this because they can make a lot of money selling into a boom whether or not it s sustainable so property prices inflate investment returns fall then prices stall growth stops more borrowers can t pay back the shakiest lenders fail and the nation slips into recession or worse government typically answers by fumbling through temporary relief spending programs and by stiffening capital requirements and stifling loans to marginal borrowers until growth becomes normal again and warnings fade and the costly cycle repeats vague and his collaborators argue in closely written chapters it s all a bit personal for vague who isn t just a scholar but also a past practitioner he contributed to prior rounds of debt expansion as he built what s now jpmorgan chase co s industry leading credit card business among his other mass marketing exploits this is a book with special resonance in trump times the last few generations of republican conservatives used to insist that too much government debt is an evil that feeds price inflation and economic stagnation and is best avoided by contrast under president trump the budget deficit towers so high that rising interest rates will boost federal borrowing costs squeezing social security medicare and military spending and yet even though or because trump is scattering borrowed cash so far beyond what the irs gathers in taxes the economy is prosperous employers are hiring at record levels and consumer and business debt on the whole has not returned to the danger levels of the mid 2000s the public debt monster should scandalize old school republicans but it doesn t so much faze vague because private debt with some exceptions has not gotten so far out of hand he sees other threats to prosperity such as global trade shocks and regional conflicts vague credits recession tracking advisers such as sherle schwenninger a founder of the google backed new america foundation the st louis fed s center for household financial stability and the institute for new economics whose backers include billionaire currency trader liberal megadonor george soros vague ran drafts past the university of bonn s moritz schularick australian neo keynsian steve keen and cornell s matthew baron among others and hired journalists such as inquirer and wall street journal alumnus don steinberg who helped make data dense chapters flow the cure for vague and his collaborators would be firm simple sustained regulation of lender capital so banks don t wreck themselves and their clients which could prove a recipe for slow growth in our fast aging society could we actually be better off with periodic booms and the opportunities they create but most western governments aren t good at sustained policy instead they ease restrictions under pressure then play catch up when the economy stalls moving in with extra public spending and rule tightening until the next round as tolstoy said of families vague tells us that booming economies look more or less the same but busted economies vary a lot depending on the speed and size of the government s response
in a recent paper by brookings on the danger of accumulation of debt by african countries he expressed concerns for african countries racking up debts sadly nigeria came to mind while putting finishing touches to this article this morning the news broke that the nigerian debt has risen by n2 66trillion in one year this translates to about 8 7 it is a common prayer in nigeria that may we not leave debt for our children you will gauge from the chorus amen that that is seen as an important prayer but is debt bequest a bad thing can we avoid it if not what sort of debt and how much of it can be left for the children finally is nigeria moving towards a debt overhang answering all these questions leads us to starting from understanding the concept of debt overhang debt overhang a phenomenon that applies to individuals households business entities and government alike refers to a situation whereby even though new debt will improve the profile of an entity it is unable to access it because the present level of debt is such that the benefits of additional debt is deemed to be subject to partial appropriation by the existing debt holders a structural macroeconomic debt overhang is a condition where additional credit creation measures are engaged in to address an underemployment or output gap the build up of which leads to a debt overhang it so happens that in most scenarios the debt overhang is preserved by substituting one form of public debt for another and it keeps growing debt overhang has various negative consequences in the literature its major consequence of serving as a disincentive for investment attracts my attention as a perspective the importance of investment as a factor of economic growth is emphasized by the employment channel through the employment channel investment enhances not only productivity but also the general welfare of the citizenry thereby leading to economic development but debt overhang hinders investments for instance an economic entity is forced to pass up investments that yield positive net present value npv a positive npv is a selection criterion for some projects and when profit oriented entities have to pass up investment alternatives just because it does not have additional capacity to take up debts to execute such alternatives opportunities to add value is lost for a nation this ultimately leads to a gdp growth that is less than its potential the concern in this instance is nigeria not only is nigeria the most populous black nation in the world but also one of the world s fastest growing countries in terms of population indeed it is projected that we will have a population of about 400million by 2050 this growth is not peculiar to nigeria the whole of africa which has roughly 1 billion in population today is expected to have grown to 4 billion by that time with nigeria contributing its own quota of 10 recently nigeria added 2 86b to its debt stock november 2018 thereby moving our total debt stock to about 76b this is inclusive of states 11b portion of the debt the tenor of this new debt are 7years 12 years and 30years with the life expectancy at birth in nigeria ranked at 178th in the world by the world health organization in 2018 currently at about 55 years for male and 56 years for female most of the current actors in consummating this loan will not be alive by the time the last tranche is paid in 2048 that is if there are no restructuring the truth is more are on the way when you project our debt profile for instance from a foreign denominated loan portfolio of below 1b up till 1993 when we joined the loan billionaire club we have gradually trended upwards to around 76billion the current foreign domestic borrowing ratio profile is 86 14 the dmo has the mandate to tilt the ratio to 60 40 the idea behind this is to free up domestic funds available from competition between the private sector and the government apparently the availability of government debt instruments which is almost always well over subscribe tends to stifle the potential growth of the private sector with its pivotal growth implication on the economy when funds they can use are equally competed for by the government the flipside to this mission is that rejigging the combination imposes more attention to dollar receivables over a long period as shortfalls may portend danger the concern for accumulation of debt is valid if you review the trend it is going up perpetually even when oil prices go up secondly the debt to income ratio which measures the tendency for revenue to cover debt is also going up and it is projected that in about 5 years revenue will no longer be able to service debt this if it crystalizes is a dire situation as the international rating agencies will write our ratings down thirdly there are some doubts about the total capture of our debt stock what that means is that the debt gdp ratio of about 18 which we currently refer to as a healthy level when compared to the estimated headroom of about 56 for countries of our development status may be incorrect if this is so and some local government debts and other uncollateralized debts have been excluded then our current debt gdp ratio may be incorrect and we may actually be nearer debt trap than we think lastly there is a concern over our foreign exchange receivables over that length of time considering that over 80 of our current foreign exchange receipts come from oil and developments in the oil markets particularly as it relates to transition to renewable energy the implication on price in the future is anything but heart warming in order to address our concerns we need to note that the source of debt is budget deficit for budget deficit to be bridged there is the need for borrowing according to the dmo in the 2018 budget there is a funding gap of over n2 1trillion of which n1 6t is to be met with domestic and foreign debts of n750b and n850b respectively sovereign debt is an equivalent of financial leverage for a company just as this leads to growth for some institutions which think through it can be an albatross for others who spend loans on frivolous things therefore debt is not necessarily bad if it leads to development conversely a low level of debt debt gdp ratio such as 21 3 for nigeria in 2017 is not necessarily good if the debt make up is not justifiable after all since 1990 our highest point was at 75 in 1991 and lowest was 7 3 in 2008 for some countries debt appears linked to economic growth and development cases in point are the us which has 19t in debt and is the largest economy in the world and japan the third biggest economy in the world have debt gdp ratio in excess of 250 but the ownership of the public debt gives another dimension to the issue as seemingly alarming the debt gdp ratio of japan is less than 5 of that portfolio is owned by foreigners while only one third of the american debt is owned by foreign countries curiously our current budget deficit looks like the subsidy for fuel whether we should and what level of subsidy the country can provide on fuel and the management of oil subsidy is a discussion for another day to make debt worth while we need to do a number of things firstly it needs to be channeled towards investment as debt that are obtained to fund life style or towards crass expenses or spending can be akin to smoking a stick of cigarette which gives satisfaction while smoking it but cannot be relied upon to give such satisfaction in medium time soon after you feel like smoking another stick and the remnant you can see is the stub snugly tied to this point is that debts should also be project targeted for instance the sum of 350m was specifically borrowed to enhance the port harcourt refinery in 1988 this involved the enhancement of production from 60 000 barrel per stream day bpsd to 210 000 bpsd this approach allows for ascertaining in specific terms the purpose of debts the process should not only be transparent debts should be taken to build capacity the return on investment should be undertaken only when the return is justifiable should such loans be taken in order words debts should be tied to project that are not only self liquidating but also such that will have multiplier effects on the economy for instance a 1995 study of the effect of software producer microsoft on the local economy revealed that each job at microsoft created 6 7 new jobs in washington state whereas a job at boeing created 3 8 jobs targeting such multiplier effects are critical a rigorous cost benefit analysis and link to economic growth should be a pre requisite for obtaining loans for instance it seems that over time for us in nigeria there is a correlation between debt pile up and poverty poverty seems to be perpetually increasing with these debts in comparison countries like china who had over 750 million poor people years ago now have just about 10 million in that category this is in contrast with nigeria with the number of poor people seemingly increasing on a yearly basis and now on the world poverty clock 86 9million people live in extreme poverty putting nigeria as the number one nation usurping india with a population that is more than 6 times nigeria s this will continue to be so for as long as our gdp growth rate currently below 2 falls short of population growth rate which is currently just below 3 per year which should put nigeria as the third most populous country in the world by 2050 these two growth rates directly affect the per capita income of a country allowance should be given for maintenance of projects currently in nigeria such allowances are either not given not adequately given or consumed altogether with corruption the maintenance culture is important for us to continue to reap the full benefits of our investment all our refineries now operate below installed capacity because of this problem and we now find ourselves in the trap of importing what we have the capacity to produce a comprehensive plan is critical good projection about national budget deficit and projects will give option on timing of debts for instance the cost of debt for sa obtained earlier in the year is cheaper than ours an important integral part of this is the institutionalization of a capital budget plan and framework which a new government should put in place within its first 6 months which will run for 3 years with serious accountability responsibility up to the highest level of the national assembly in this new age of knowledge economy know where and know when are increasingly becoming more important than know how and know what mere facts the different timings for nigeria s foreign debt as well as that of south africa this same year comes to mind whereas south africa obtained loan at 6 in may nigeria obtained loan at 9 75 in october in the space of few months there has been about 33 increase in the cost of debt by implication nigeria has started a catch up race with south africa from day one in terms of putting the project to use and should then have the potential of earning more in order to compete with the equivalent south african project this scenario is needless if our administration has a better know when appreciation tied to this penultimate issue is the growth rate of the economy comparing our cost of debt with economic growth rate gives a gloomy scenario if we compare our economy that is expected to grow at 2 by year end with 9 75 cost of debt literarily means that whereas the nigerian economy to which the funds is applied will grow at 2 we will add 9 75 in value to the lender of the funds whether country or institution the engagement of the federal legislators by the populace is critical the truth is that the total number of legislators in both houses of 469 in conjunction with the executive consummate this debts on our behalf once the budget is approved it implies that the 200 million nigerians have approved it we need to see representation as a very serious business the consciousness on the part of the electorates is currently missing by some of the actions of the federal legislatures on budgeting you find it difficult to argue that the consciousness on issues of debt is not also lost on the majority of them we deserve the best people to take decisions at the highest level of consciousness and responsibility waste and cost of governance are also too high in nigeria when we engage in needless debate about infrastructure as a major driver of growth which creates an enabling environment for businesses to thrive we need to acknowledge that the level of waste and cost of governance is too high this can be attested to by the mind boggling level of appointments at all levels of executive and a wanton waste of resources eradicating waste and drastically reducing cost of governance will unarguably create a healthy headroom to allocate resources to enhance the level of infrastructure expanding our revenue base is of importance in alliance with the position of the imf our tax base may currently be adequate but not efficient as there are loopholes still to be blocked this concern for an inadequate revenue base is founded in the fact that a budget deficit is inseparably attached to deficit budgeting arising from insufficient revenue to meet budgeted expenditure for instance as of may 2017 only 14mio people of 70million taxable nigerians pay taxes this means 80 of economically active and taxable nigerians still evade taxes of the big five economies in africa nigeria with the biggest economy has by far the least tax revenue to gdp of 6 1 this compares with 26 9 for south africa and 10 33 11 6 and 18 4 for angola ethiopia and kenya respectively even though this may be a reflection of poverty spread the 80 of economically active nigerians which are currently evading taxes shows that there is a huge room for improvement this leakage adds to the leakage from the grossly under taxed nigerians again to compound the situation corruption cannot be taxed the issue of tax structure is indeed a discussion for another day when these tax leakages which have multiplier effect are combined with the unjustifiable economic rent driven government concessions there comes the inevitable realization that some of our sovereign debts are probably needless as a proper revenue capture would have made these debts unnecessary in conclusion whereas an accumulated public debt in itself and a high debt gdp ratio is not necessarily bad the structure of ownership between domestic and foreign should be watched most importantly how transparent the process is in addition to the economic justification of the debt debt planning the timing of the debt paying attention to the revenue base of the country as well as dogged implementation of projects are of utmost importance the rising debt service as a percentage of revenue which the dmo warned against in its recent debt sustainability analysis dsa and which imf warned as being extremely high at 63 before the last foreign debt can only be reined in if in addition to the mentioned palliatives our currency does not suffer depreciation this looks like a tall order considering the current macroeconomic situation and outlook morakinyo lectures economics at the pan atlantic university lagos
shi yu china daily dashing hopes of a quick agreement on trade relations with china the us administration imposed punitive tariffs on another 200 billion of chinese goods now that the chinese government has responded with new tariffs on 60 billion of us products the united states is threatening tariffs targeting yet another 300 billion of chinese imports both sides are now digging in for a long fight largely because americans have yet to feel the pain of the white house s policies china understood the us administration s transaction style some time ago but it only recently began to appreciate fully the significance of the white house s america first policy which according to us state department policy director kiron skinner rests on four pillars national sovereignty reciprocity burden sharing and regional partnerships national sovereignty and reciprocity are standard features of any country s foreign policy they form the foundations of the 1648 peace of westphalia which recognized after the thirty years war that sovereign states have their own interests to defend and must engage with other states on a reciprocal basis us undercuts interests of even its closest allies but washington often takes reciprocity too far weakening the us capacity to build and maintain partnerships regional or otherwise indeed the incumbent us administration has undercut the interests of its closest allies for its own narrow benefit even threatening to impose broad tariffs on automobile and auto part imports from the european union japan and the republic of korea claiming that they pose a national security threat in any case the active ingredient of the white house doctrine is burden sharing skinner interprets this narrowly focusing on the need for the us nato allies to increase their defense spending what she does not acknowledge is that the us is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural savings deficit the us consistently runs both a fiscal deficit with total expenditure of which defense comprised 14 8 percent in 2017 significantly exceeding its income and a current account deficit if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of over 3 percent of gdp per annum net us debt to the rest of the world currently at 40 percent of gdp will double in less than 24 years washington barking up the wrong tree the us administration insists that the only deficit to worry about is the bilateral trade deficit with china but even if china bowed to us demands and eliminated the bilateral deficit america s imbalance of savings and investment would merely shift its external deficit like water in a squeezed balloon toward other surplus economies such as the eu japan and the rok the targets of the threatened automotive tariffs for decades the us savings shortfall seemed like a problem to be managed not solved since the us started running structural deficits in the 1970s there has been a kind of global grand bargain on the issue the world willingly finances america s current account deficit in us dollars in exchange the us acts as a guarantor of free trade and global security the white house doctrine upends that bargain by weaponizing the us economic leverage including the us dollar it aims to force the world to uphold its end with no guarantee that the us will respond in kind us is engaging in tax subterfuge this approach will end up costing virtually everyone beginning with american consumers with its trade war the us administration is engaging in tax subterfuge historically governments have addressed their excessive debts with tax increases spending cuts higher inflation with negative real interest rates or in the case of the roman empire conquest of creditors it seems to be politically impossible for the us government to raise taxes domestically so it has found a workaround tariff increases end up serving effectively as consumption taxes but because they can be blamed on foreigners they are more palatable to the american public from the white house s perspective the costs of this approach appear low with the us economy still growing stock markets at record highs and unemployment at record lows jpmorgan has estimated that the trade war s direct costs will amount to just 0 2 percent of gdp for the us 0 4 percent of gdp for china and 0 22 percent of gdp for the rest of the world through 2020 but today s prosperity hinges mainly on the temporary effects of budget busting tax cuts and quantitative easing qe by the us federal reserve which expanded its balance sheet by 3 6 trillion from 2007 to 2017 it has since reduced that total by 391 billion historically low interest rates and liquidity inflated asset bubbles financed the fiscal deficit and enabled the household sector to deleverage it was thanks largely to qe that us net wealth increased by 33 6 trillion from 2010 to 2018 wealth not shared equally in america that wealth was not however shared equally on the contrary the qe centered approach has deepened domestic inequality for example every time the s p 500 has dipped over the last decade corporate share buybacks amounting to 5 trillion from 2008 to 2018 provided a cushion this was technically good for growth the s p 500 index rose by a total of 319 percent from its 2009 trough to its march 2019 peak but the us trade war is threatening even those narrowly shared and for the fed costly gains for the top 25 s p companies with a combined market capitalization exceeding 20 trillion just under one third of revenues come from chinese mainland and taiwan weighted average meaning that tariffs on chinese imports will hit profits tech giants that depend on chips components and software sales to the mainland amounting to 20 65 percent of total revenue will face particularly high costs as will us shoe importers the trade war seems not to have caused much pain yet because financial markets assume perhaps wrongly that central banks will bail them out with more qe but after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion compared to a historical average of 48 months the us could soon find itself in a painful recession owing to disruptions caused by the us triggered trade war perhaps then it will be ready for a truce andrew sheng is a distinguished fellow of the asia global institute at the university of hong kong and a member of the unep

socialism is enjoying a prominence in american public debate not seen since the years before the second world war representative alexandria ocasio cortez among others has stressed that she wants america to be more like scandinavia no surprise there given that the youngest congresswoman to take office in american history is a self proclaimed democratic socialist in defense of her ideas which include a green new deal medicare for all and a guaranteed job plan for all americans to be paid for by a proposed 70 percent marginal tax rate ocasio cortez has referred to nordic countries as successful democratic socialist models that the united states should seek to emulate when asked during a january 2019 interview with 60 minutes if she wanted to turn the u s into a version of venezuela or the soviet union the millennial congresswomen demurred with an incredulous smile responding that my policies most closely resemble what we see in the u k in norway in finland in sweden one can understand the american left s admiration for nordic style democratic socialism at first glance nordic countries appear to combine relatively high living standards with low poverty with narrow income distributions fully government funded education generous parental leave policies and long lifespans everything the left would like america to embrace their argument takes its starting point in the perception that the scandinavian third way economic model combining the wealth creation of capitalism with the safety net of socialism works well and that the u s could reach the same socioeconomic outcomes and prosperity by expanding the role of government however a closer look at the politics economy and history of the nordic nations makes evident that as with most urban legends the reality of ocasio cortez s nordic utopia is quite different from the dream as the political philosopher richard weaver once quipped the problem with the next generation is that it has not read the minutes of the last meeting before americans try to become more like scandinavia whose combined population is roughly comparable to that of the greater new york city metropolitan area although less diverse it would be wise to explore how scandinavia became scandinavia in his 2015 book scandinavian unexceptionalism swedish researcher nima sanandaji argues that the nordic states sweden in particular historically developed remarkably high levels of social trust and cohesion along with a robust work ethic these societal qualities predate the formation of the modern welfare state one can reasonably assume as leading swedish economist assar lindbeck suggested in 2003 that societal norms in favor of work or against living off handouts from others originally emerged in societies where it was challenging to survive without working the northern european work ethic can be traced back to the hostile physical environment of preindustrial scandinavia which historically required farmers to work exceptionally hard for their farms to survive and yield a profit the population gradually came to develop a collective ethos and social norms based on initiative social trust dedicated labor and individual responsibility combined with sound institutions and high levels of civic participation these factors in the nordic success story were noted over a hundred years ago by the german sociologist max weber who suggested that northern european countries tend to have a higher living standard than other parts of europe due to their protestant work ethic despite coming from the poorest rungs of nordic society the 2 million scandinavian immigrants who traveled across the atlantic to pursue the american dream following the civil war long before the establishment of scandinavia s modern welfare states soon gained the reputation of being hardworking disciplined and honest a scandinavian economist once told milton friedman in scandinavia we have no poverty to which friedman replied that s interesting because in america among scandinavians we have no poverty either although both overstated their arguments today the approximately 12 million americans of scandinavian origin are still prospering with similar or lower poverty levels and higher living standards than their nordic brethren despite living in the american system ocasio cortez wants to change charles walgreen son of a swedish immigrant established walgreen s america s largest drugstore chain swedish born johan nordstrom created the nordstrom retail empire eric wickman founded greyhound america s biggest bus line indeed historically swedish americans have been better off than swedes at home in sweden with considerably higher average income rates writes sanandaji based on data from the u s census bureau and the european statistical office contrary to the prevailing narrative we also find that the relative success of nordic countries like sweden as measured by high living standards long life expectancy and low crime rates combined with a considerable degree of social cohesion and even distribution of income actually precedes the contemporary welfare state eleven years before adam smith published his classic the wealth of nations 1776 regarded as the foundation of economic liberalism the swedish parliament member anders chydenius published the national gain 1765 which advocated for the necessity of free markets in fostering economic prosperity during the following century these ideas were embraced by swedish minister of finance johan august gripenstedt who introduced extensive economic laissez faire reforms deregulating the financial sector while promoting free enterprise competition and trade during his tenure from 1856 to 1866 these reforms prompted sweden s transition to capitalism and are credited with its achieving by 1890 one of the fastest global economic growth rates during the subsequent prosperous 60 years when such internationally successful companies as ikea and volvo were founded tax rates were lower in sweden than in other european countries as well as in the united states taxation levels rose to 20 percent of gdp only in the 1950s the formally neutral country had not officially participated in the first or second world war which had devastated other european industrial nations sweden s period of classical economic liberalism did not last the decades that followed were characterized by the growth of the generous cradle to grave welfare state envied by ocasio cortez senator bernie sanders and their fellow progressives they featured government intervention an increase of tax rates and the regulation of previously free markets the country s total tax burden peaked in 1990 at 52 3 percent with a corresponding negative impact on business and job creation these socialist golden years were not so golden for economic performance while sweden s growth was second in the world in 1970 japan was first it quickly dropped by 1990 to the second lowest within the organization for economic co operation and development oecd a subsequent financial crisis in the 1990s saw gdp growth sink and unemployment spike while the government raised interest rates to a staggering 500 percent in an effort to avoid devaluing its currency the swedish model has been put to severe tests in more recent years including by the integration of refugees into the job market this has prompted calls for the country s social contract to be revised factors ranging from rigid labor market regulations generous welfare benefits provided even to highly taxed people and discriminatory societal attitudes have been holding many immigrants back sweden has one of the developed world s largest differences between labor market participation by native and foreign born workers unemployment problems have resulted in de facto segregation with social exclusion and unrest spreading in several parts of the country immigrants who move elsewhere with an entrepreneurial spirit often have a better experience in 2006 swedish economic historian benny carlson compared the experiences of the large swedish somali immigrant group with those of somali americans in minnesota he quotes two immigrants who jointly summed up this disparity there are opportunities here said jamal hashi manager of an african restaurant in minneapolis his countryman who immigrated to sweden tells a different story you feel like a fly trapped under a glass your dreams are shattered it seems as if ocasio cortez s scandinavian shangri la exists in her own fantasy world the truth is that scandinavian countries enjoyed prosperous economic systems before the welfare states we know today were established if the congresswoman were truly interested in learning from the nordic experience she would note that sweden began to revise its economic model based on lessons drawn from its recession of the 1990s by implementing reforms that would have made many of her republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle proud as the ideal image of socialism lost its sparkle state owned companies were sold and financial markets were deregulated while public monopolies were replaced with competition sweden needed healthy companies and skilled workers so top tax rates were rolled back many government welfare programs were redesigned these reforms laid the ground for today s competitive swedish market oriented economy based on openness and the promotion of global free trade like beauty the success of the scandinavian welfare states seems to be in the eyes of the beholder what we find when we examine nordic politics economy and history as exemplified by sweden suggests that the northern european success story was not achieved thanks to the welfare state model funded by high taxes but perhaps despite its existence in her novel the story of gösta berling 1891 the swedish nobel prize winning author selma lagerlöf describes the fate of the fictional character kevenhüller he forsakes the privileges of his aristocratic birth in germany to improve mankind with his mechanical inventions after traveling throughout europe he finally reaches sweden where his meeting with a wood nymph transforms his life she reciprocates his kindness to her by granting him the ability to realize one single wish frustrated by his inability to replicate his inventions kevenhüller ultimately destroys them all and goes mad the fate of kevenhüller s inventions has parallels to today s visionary wishes to transplant nordic style democratic socialism to the u s rather than persistently suggesting that the american dream can be realized by expanding government or raising taxes it is time for ocasio cortez and others to realize that duplicating scandinavian welfare policies in the hope of achieving the same socioeconomic outcomes without recognizing the context dependent conditions that made them possible in the first place might be harder than they think rather it is time for leading voices on the progressive left to reveal the costs of maintaining nordic welfarism in the form of higher taxes on ordinary middle class working families who produce america s wealth nordic nations offer valuable lessons for u s policymakers lessons that do not fit traditional ideal stereotypes of glorified democratic socialist utopias or failed socialist experiments on the road to serfdom the true lesson to be learned from the scandinavian experience is that the nordic style welfare state models are hard to replicate in societies that are fundamentally different and they re flawed at home

their claims in exchange for a percentage of the claimant s inheritance two companies and two executives agreed to split fees and to not contact the other s clients one company and its executive pleaded guilty while the other company and its executive proceeded to trial prior to trial the district court made two important holdings first the rule of reason would apply to the heir location agreement not the per se the court reasoned that per se treatment was inappropriate for an agreement structured in an unusual way that affected only a small number of estates in a relatively obscure industry the court added that the agreement may have contained efficiency enhancing potential second the court held that the statute of limitations barred prosecution and mere ministerial tasks like distributing payments did not extend the conspiracy beyond the agreement s stated termination date in july 2008 united states v kemp assocs inc no 16 cr 00403 d utah aug 28 2017 the government

f 3d 1264 10th cir 2018 in february 2019 the district court reversed its earlier rule of reason decision and determined that the agreement in the present case is a horizontal customer allocation

joint guidance arguing that anti poaching agreements are per se such no poach or no hire clauses in employment contracts prohibit companies from soliciting one another s employees the guidance also stated that certain no poach agreements that are ancillary to otherwise pro competitive conduct will be subject to a quick look or rule of reason level of scrutiny while the recent activity has been confined to the franchise setting there is no reason to believe it will remain so confined in early 2018 doj assistant attorney general makan delrahim stated that the doj will criminally investigate and prosecute so called no poach agreements the doj brought its first case since the policy was announced reaching a civil settlement with two firms knorr bremse ag and westinghouse air brake technologies corp for allegedly agreeing not to recruit and hire each other s employees in announcing the settlement doj specified that it was handled civilly rather than criminally only because the conduct ceased when the guidance was announced in 2016 since then numerous state attorneys general have initiated antitrust investigations into the use of no poach agreements by franchise based fast food operations the washington attorney general has led the charge the washington ag has obtained agreements from 30 nationwide chains to eliminate the use of no poach clauses in their franchise contracts while the washington ag s investigation has expanded from fast food chains to other industries including hotels car repair gyms home health care convenience stores cleaning tax preparation parcel electronics repair child care custom window covering travel and insurance adjuster services several follow on civil class actions have since been filed by employees of certain franchise based companies mid year update the doj filed statements of interest in three civil suits in the eastern district of washington to inform the court of the doj s view as to what standard the court should apply to individual no poach agreements per se or rule of reason the doj maintains that strictly horizontal no poach agreements between competitors should be governed by the per se rule whereas vertical no poach agreements that are reasonably related to a legitimate business goal should be governed by the rule of reason in may 2019 the doj intervened in a class action alleging that duke university and the university of north carolina agreed not to permit the hiring of each other s medical faculty in 2018 the court certified a class consisting of faculty members with an academic

indirect subsidiary s participation in the power cables cartel in its decision of april 2 2014 the commission applied its case law according to which a parent company that exercises decisive influence over a subsidiary can be found liable for the competition law infringements of that subsidiary more specifically the commission applied its parental liability presumption according to which a parent company is presumed to exercise such decisive influence when it wholly owns its subsidiary or holds almost all of the shares of its subsidiary the investment bank appealed the commission s decision arguing that it held less than 91 of the shares of the subsidiary that had participated in the cartel the general court rejected this argument and held that the parental liability presumption can be applied even if the parent company holds less than 100 of the shares of its subsidiary but is able to exercise all the voting rights in the subsidiary the investment bank has appealed the general court s ruling to the european court of justice supra sovereign sovereign and agency ssa bonds on december 20 2018 the commission sent statement of objections to banks involved in trading supra

by katherine greifeld jun 14 2019 at 10 30 am international trade when donald trump bemoaned that a weakening yuan had nullified some of the punitive effect of his tariffs on china he was highlighting unwittingly perhaps a crucial flaw in his foreign policy tool of choice in an era of free floating exchange rates currencies adjust so quickly they can offset the intended impact of higher levies before they even take hold it s an inconvenient truth for the u s in its escalating trade war with the world s only other economic superpower and one that could complicate the president s efforts to use tariffs as way to pressure america s major trading partners into making concessions after trump raised tariffs on 200 billion of chinese imports last month the yuan quickly fell toward 7 per dollar a level not seen since the financial crisis the drop effectively reduced the price of chinese imports in dollars and has blunted the cost shock of higher tariffs the same thing happened with the peso following a similar threat against mexico in late may the peso plunged over 2 in less than an hour so for all of trump s tough talk about punishing china for what he considers unfair trade practices americans might not see any meaningful markups on chinese made goods it illustrates the difficulty of trying to use tariffs to reduce your trade deficit in a global world said brad setser senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and a former treasury official in some ways trump s use of tariffs hearkens back to a very different era when countries used fixed exchange rates under the bretton woods agreement which lasted from the mid 1940s to the early 1970s of course the yuan floats far less than most major currencies in global fx markets because of limits imposed by the people s bank of china but based on calculations by robin brooks chief economist of the institute of international finance and former head of fx strategy at goldman sachs its decline from 6 4 to 6 9 per dollar since last summer roughly offset the impact of the first two rounds of u s tariffs which were first announced in june 2018 these foreign exchange adjustments are one of many reasons that economists generally take a dim view of tariffs not only do they trigger retaliatory tit for tat disputes that undermine business confidence and economic growth but the costs that aren t offset in the currency market are borne primarily by the consumers in the countries that impose them and while trump has asserted the u s is getting a lot of money from china because of the tariffs the reality is less clear u s companies that import goods from china can either absorb the additional cost and pay the government an extra 25 or pass it onto consumers by raising prices this doesn t take into account fx adjustments that may lessen the actual impact of the levies the cost of the u s tariffs has fallen squarely on the u s vicky redwood and simon macadam of capital economics wrote in a note this month foreign exchange has emerged as a focal point in trade talks on friday trump once again asserted that china is manipulating its currency the administration proposed taxing goods from countries with undervalued currencies last month a proposal that was said to alarm even its own treasury department officials the u s has also sought a yuan stability pact as part of an eventual deal according to people familiar with the matter for the time being china seems to be exercising restraint after trump threatened to impose more tariffs on 300 billion of chinese imports this week and keeping the yuan from depreciating even faster brooks estimates that fair value for the yuan is close to 7 3 per dollar versus 6 93 now and while the pboc has routinely stepped in to support the yuan whenever it inched toward 7 per dollar in the past there are now signs that stance could change if trade tensions worsen in a rare interview with bloomberg news this month yi gang the pboc s governor signaled a new willingness to let the markets dictate the yuan s value a little bit of flexibility of renminbi is good for the chinese economy and for the global economy because it provides an automatic stabilizer he said of course letting the yuan fall as much as the market sees fit isn t without its own risks the currency s devaluation in 2015 caused billions of dollars of capital to flee china and forced the central bank to burn through its foreign exchange reserves which stand 3 1 trillion to stem the outflow what s more a weaker currency would reduce the purchasing power of chinese consumers nevertheless trump s trade war might just force china s hand he is relying on china not to respond to his tariffs with a weaker currency setser said but it s clearly china s decision not

until the eve of the 1929 slump the worst america has ever faced things were rosy cars and construction thrived in the roaring 1920s and solid jobs in both industries helped lift wages and consumption ford was making 9 000 of its model t cars a day and spending on new build homes hit 5 billion in 1925 there were bumps along the way 1923 and 1926 saw slowdowns but momentum was strong banks looked good too by 1929 the combined balance sheets of america s 25 000 lenders stood at 60 billion the assets they held seemed prudent just 60 were loans with 15 held as cash even the 20 made up by investment securities seemed sensible the lion s share of holdings were bonds with ultra safe government bonds making up more than half with assets of such high quality the banks allowed the capital buffers that protected them from losses to dwindle but as the 1920s wore on the young federal reserve faced a conundrum share prices and prices in the shops started to move in opposite directions markets were booming with the shares of firms exploiting new technologies radios aluminium and aeroplanes particularly popular but few of these new outfits had any record of dividend payments and investors piled into their shares in the hope that they would continue to increase in value at the same time established businesses were looking weaker as consumer prices fell for a time the puzzle whether to raise rates to slow markets or cut them to help the economy paralysed the fed in the end the market watchers won and the central bank raised rates in 1928 it was a catastrophic error the increase from 3 5 to 5 was too small to blunt the market rally share prices soared until september 1929 with the dow jones index hitting a high of 381 but it hurt america s flagging industries by late summer industrial production was falling at an annualised rate of 45 adding to the domestic woes came bad news from abroad in september the london stock exchange crashed when clarence hatry a fraudulent financier was arrested a sell off was coming it was huge over just two days october 28th and 29th the dow lost close to 25 by november 13th it was at 198 down 45 in two months worse was to come bank failures came in waves the first in 1930 began with bank runs in agricultural states such as arkansas illinois and missouri a total of 1 350 banks failed that year then a second wave hit chicago cleveland and philadelphia in april 1931 external pressure worsened the domestic worries as britain dumped the gold standard its exchange rate dropped putting pressure on american exporters there were banking panics in austria and germany as public confidence evaporated americans again began to hoard currency a bond buying campaign by the federal reserve brought only temporary respite because the surviving banks were in such bad shape this became clear in february 1933 a final panic this time national began to force more emergency bank holidays with lenders in nevada iowa louisiana and michigan the first to shut their doors the inland banks called in inter bank deposits placed with new york lenders stripping them of 760m in february 1933 alone naturally the city bankers turned to their new backstop the federal reserve but the unthinkable happened on march 4th the central bank did exactly what it had been set up to prevent it refused to lend and shut its doors in its mission to act as a source of funds in all emergencies the federal reserve had failed a week long bank holiday was called across the nation it was the blackest week in the darkest period of american finance regulators examined banks books and more than 2 000 banks that closed that week never opened again after this low things started to improve nearly 11 000 banks had failed between 1929 and 1933 and the money supply dropped by over 30 unemployment just 3 2 on the eve of the crisis rose to more than 25 it would not return to its previous lows until the early 1940s it took more than 25 years for the dow to reclaim its peak in 1929 reform was clearly needed the first step was to de risk the system in the short term this was done through a massive injection of publicly supplied capital the 1 billion boost a third of the system s existing equity went to more than 6 000 of the remaining 14 000 banks future risks were to be neutralised by new legislation the glass steagall rules that separated stockmarket operations from more mundane lending and gave the fed new powers to regulate banks whose customers used credit for investment a new government body was set up to deal with bank runs once and for all the federal deposit insurance commission fdic established on january 1st 1934 by protecting 2 500 of deposits per customer it aimed to reduce the costs of bank failure limiting depositor losses would protect income the money supply and buying power and because depositors could trust the fdic they would not queue up at banks at the slightest financial wobble in a way it worked brilliantly banks quickly started advertising the fact that they were fdic insured and customers came to see deposits as risk free for 70 years bank runs became a thing of the past banks were able to reduce costly liquidity and equity buffers which fell year on year an inefficient system of self insurance fell away replaced by low cost risk sharing with central banks and deposit insurance as the backstop yet this was not at all what hamilton had hoped for he wanted a financial system that made government more stable and banks and markets that supported public debt to allow infrastructure and military spending at low rates of interest by 1934 the opposite system had been created it was now the state s job to ensure that the financial system was stable rather than vice versa by loading risk onto the taxpayer the evolution of finance had created a distorting subsidy at the heart of capitalism the recent fate of the largest banks in america and britain shows the true cost of these subsidies in 2008 citigroup and rbs group were enormous with combined assets of nearly 6 trillion greater than the combined gdp of the world s 150 smallest countries their capital buffers were tiny when they ran out of capital the bail out ran to over 100 billion the overall cost of the banking crisis is even greater in the form of slower growth higher debt and poorer employment prospects that may last decades in some countries but the bail outs were not a mistake letting banks of this size fail would have been even more costly the problem is not what the state does but that its hand is forced knowing that governments must bail out banks means parts of finance have become a one way bet banks debt is a prime example the imf recently estimated that the world s largest banks benefited from implicit government subsidies worth a total of 630 billion in the year 2011 12 this makes debt cheap and promotes leverage in america meanwhile there are proposals for the government to act as a backstop for the mortgage market covering 90 of losses in a crisis again this pins risk on the public purse it is the same old pattern to solve this problem means putting risk back into the private sector that will require tough choices removing the subsidies banks enjoy will make their debt more expensive meaning equity holders will lose out on dividends and the cost of credit could rise cutting excessive deposit insurance means credulous investors who put their nest eggs into dodgy banks could see big losses as regulators implement a new round of reforms in the wake of the latest crisis they have an opportunity to reverse the trend towards ever greater entrenchment of the state s role in finance but weaning the industry off government support will not be easy as the stories of these crises show hundreds of years of financial history have been pushing in the other direction

analysis on the job openings and labor turnover survey or jolts from the u s bureau of labor statistics while these figures document one of the tightest labor markets of this century improvements in recent months have been marginal begging the question of whether there remains any slack for further tightening research assistant somin park discussed the findings of a new paper on heterogeneous returns to wealth by economists andreas fagereng of statistics norway luigi guiso of the einaudi institute for economics and finance davide malacrino of the international monetary fund and equitable growth grantee luigi pistaferri among other findings park highlights that risk compensation is insufficient to explain the substantially higher returns to wealth for the wealthiest taxpayers and mentions potential implications of this paper for future research and tax policy park also penned a blog this week on new research from imf economists jonathan d ostry prakash loungani and davide furceri on the importance of distributional considerations in economic policymaking in particular the authors argue that policies that reduce inequality can strengthen growth and social cohesion and

by using force and pretending to benevolence the hegemon will certainly have a large state by using virtue and practicing benevolence the wise ruler will achieve humane authority mencius in the course

currency after the global financial crisis zhou xiaochuan governor of the bank of china announced the world needs an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and able to remain stable in the long run removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit based national currencies he proposed special drawing rights sdrs that derive their value from a basket of world currencies nobelists c fred bergsten robert mundell and joseph stieglitz were supportive the creation of a global currency would restore a needed coherence to the international monetary system give the imf a function that would help it to promote stability and be a catalyst for international harmony to demonstrate the scheme s stability china began valuing its own currency the rmb against a basket of dollars euros yen and pounds sterling and almost immediately complaints about rmb valuation ceased the imf made its first sdr loan in 2014 the world bank issued the first sdr bond in 2016 standard chartered bank issued the first commercial sdr notes in 2017 and the world s central banks began stating reserves in sdrs in 2019 while few noticed the advent of sdrs the creation of the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib in 2015 was a sensation former us treasury secretary larry summers called it the moment the united states lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic system i can think of no event since bretton woods comparable to the combination of china s effort to establish a major new institution and the failure of the us to persuade dozens of its traditional allies starting with britain to stay out of it the aiib guarantees a trillion dollars annually in long term low interest loans for regional infrastructure poverty reduction growth and climate change mitigation and allows eurasia s four billion savers to mobilize local savings that previously had few safe or creative outlets china which contributes a full brigade of eight thousand soldiers to un peacekeeping is integrating the united nations into its plans the un unanimously adopted xi s xi s resolution to settle disputes through dialogue and resolve differences through

counterparts the world security scene will change irrevocably in 1949 mao warned that the country would remain insecure unconsolidated and delegitimized until it transformed both the old imperial world order and the old china the following year the us bombed coastal dandong and strafed civilians in several cities its warplanes buzzed coastal shantou and winston churchill told the world i believe in the ultimate partition of china and i mean ultimate the insults continued for decades in 1992 after the us defense department announced its mission to prevent a rival superpower emerging in asia the navy held a chinese cargo ship the yinhe at gunpoint in international waters for three weeks claiming she was carrying contraband she wasn t two years later president clinton sent the most powerful fleet ever assembled through the taiwan strait in 1998 the us dropped five precision bombs on china s embassy in belgrade killing three diplomats and seriously wounding twenty and cia director george tenet told congress it was the only target we nominated in 2014 a us navy article proposed laying offensive underwater mines along china s coast and destroying her maritime lines of communication while sending special forces to arm minorities in xinjiang and tibet in 2017 the air force reaffirmed its willingness to launch a nuclear attack on china and in 2018 the navy practiced blocking china s access to oil through the malacca strait though says defense analyst michael thim the plan china s navy had sufficient capabilities in place in 1996 such that sending carrier strike groups into the taiwan strait would be suicidal the situation has only become more challenging for the navy in recent years not because the plan has acquired an aircraft carrier of its own but because china has greatly enhanced and modernized its existing anti access area denial capabilities it has indeed strategically china applies mao s peoples war strategies in the south china sea and western navies are struggling to respond when the japanese or kmt armies arrived the local guerillas would retreat but the invading forces couldn t stay forever and when they left the pla was still there when british or american fleets arrive the coast guard and naval militia disappear and when the fleets go the boats reappear the goal is to push the philippines and vietnam to the negotiating table at which point it has won the conflict in such a situation conventional weapons become symbolic whoever shoots first loses since an f 35 can t actually shoot anything the plan can neutralize it with a fishing boat the us cannot raise its incursions to a political level that could freeze strategy while china can coordinate military legal diplomatic and economic aspects simultaneously the power of the nation state by no means consists only in its armed forces but also in its economic and technological resources in the dexterity foresight and resolution with which its foreign policy is conducted in the efficiency of its social and political organization it consists most of all in the nation itself the people their skills energy ambition discipline initiative beliefs myths and illusions and it consists further in the way all these factors are related to one another by 2015 said the rand corporation china could endanger the us navy s surface fleet a thousand miles from its coast and the chief of its indo pacific command told the senate there is no guarantee that the united states would win a future conflict with china by 2019 the navy s seventh fleet of seventy ships charged with projecting us power to the indo pacific faced three hundred plan warships two hundred missile and gun boats defending its coast and the navy expects the plan to deploy 342 warships by 2021 the plan s mastery of naval logistics is unparalleled in 2018 alone it launched fifteen new warships and began simultaneous construction of four nuclear submarines even the us navy shopping for a floating dock

plunge into the water near the target six type 055 heavy missile cruisers the world s most powerful surface combatants each with one hundred twenty eight tubes carry surface to air anti ship land attack and anti submarine missiles while below the surface seventy nuclear and conventional submarines carry yj 12 anti ship cruise missiles and wake homing torpedoes that deliver five hundred pound warheads at sixty mph from fifteen miles away the greatest threat however was born when the navy invited a chinese admiral on a courtesy visit to the uss nimitz upon his return the officer told colleagues i ve just seen the world s biggest target if we can t hit an aircraft carrier we can t hit anything thrifty engineers attached a new guidance system to an existing land based missile and created a new class of weapon the million dollar df 21d anti ship ballistic carrier killer it carries a half ton warhead one thousand miles then drops it vertically at 7 500 mph onto 12 billion aircraft carriers the usni says it can destroy a carrier in one strike and that there is currently no defense against it its sibling the df 26d has a range of two thousand miles in 2019 robert haddick warned china s anti ship missile capability exceeds that of the united states in terms of range speed and sensor performance captain james fanell a senior naval intelligence officer added we know that china has the most advanced ballistic missile force in the world they have the capacity to overwhelm the defensive systems we are pursuing on the ballistic front line the cm 401 is a high supersonic ballistic missile designed for rapid precision strikes against medium size ships naval task forces and offshore facilities within two hundred miles but to destroy military bases in the region the plan relies on the larger cj 10 a subsonic missile with a two thousand mile range and a half ton payload that uses inertial and satellite navigation terrain contour matching and digital scene mapping area correlation for terminal guidance with a cep of forty feet a longer ranged anti ship version the yj 100 can be air launched or fired from type 055 vertical launch tubes for conflicts close to the mainland or taiwan says the rand corporation china achieved full parity in 2017 and by 2021 will deploy more fifth generation fighters in the area than the us j 20 fighter bombers have an operational range of a thousand miles carry bigger payloads faster higher and further than america s f 22 raptor and release yj 12 anti ship cruise missiles that travel two hundred miles then deliver a thousand pound warhead in a corkscrew trajectory at supersonic speed the navy says that even against alerted warships thirty two percent of missiles score hits and a single strike will render any vessel inoperable the j 20 also carries the specialized pla 15 propelled by novel dual pulse rocket motors on a semi ballistic trajectory they home on awacs and airborne tankers loitering behind battle lines in 2015 usaf general herbert carlisle told congress that he can field two hundred f 22 raptors carrying six missiles while china s more numerous fighters each carry twelve longer ranged weapons look at the pla 15 at the range of that weapon how do we counter that following his testimony the air force canceled its e 8c awacs recapitalization explaining that they would be easy prey for the pla 15 the pla 15 s smaller sibling pla 10 is no less deadly says isis airpower specialist douglas barrie for the notional western combat aircraft pilot there is no obvious respite to be found in attempting to avoid within visual range threat of the pla 10 by keeping beyond visual range in this environment also the plaaf will be able to mount an increasingly credible challenge and at engagement ranges

and plan soldiers receive more political education than the rest of the world s armies combined xiaoming zhang explained the thinking behind this under the influence of confucian philosophy the concept of the just or righteous war was prevalent throughout chinese society so unlike western militaries which depend on professional ethics and training to ensure that soldiers perform their duties in war the pla opted for political indoctrination and attempted to make troops understand why a war must be fought and how it would matter to them historian william hinton says from its inception the army has been led by the party and has never played a purely military role on the contrary army cadres have always played a leading political role in 1927 mao wrote the red army fights not merely for the sake of fighting but in order to conduct xuānchuán among the people organize arm and help them establish revolutionary political power without these objectives fighting loses its meaning and the red army loses its reason for existence no matter how well armed or valorous an army is to win wars it needs the support of the citizens who pay for it and here china has an advantage china s leaders often invoke the feelings of the chinese people in international disputes and surveys reveal that their attitudes are more hawkish than dovish and younger chinese much more inclined to call on the

satoshi s rebuttal of modern monetary theory examining the origin of a century old economic ideology and how bitcoin invalidates many of its core principles jack purdy follow published in messari crypto 9 min read jun 3 2019 6 listen share this was originally sent to subscribers of messari s unqualified opinions click here to become a subscriber and access all of our historical content what is money for something so pervasive in our day to day lives it is unfortunate that people don t ask themselves this question more often most people simply equate money with those pieces of paper stamped with faces of dead people for that is what fulfills their preconceived notion of money they buy groceries means of exchange at different relative prices unit of account with money saved in their checking account store of value it s really no surprise then that the nature of money isn t frequently questioned as these pieces of paper have been all most people have known to be money for their entire life this hasn t always been the case today s sovereign money is in the grand scheme of monetary history an experiment the u s dollar in its current form has been around for less than a century dollar bills used to be freely redeemable paper representations of gold until fdr suspended their convertibility and outlawed private gold ownership nixon later solidified the lack of any hard backing to the dollar when he ended the bretton woods system that fixed the dollar to gold in international markets while most people wouldn t notice any difference after that day they went from transacting using a millennia old commodity to the full faith and credit of the united states modern day monopoly money this notion of using fiat money that exists by government decree is still a relatively new concept and not only has it not endured the tests of time but it has demonstrated a propensity for mismanagement after germany went off the gold standard post world war 1 for instance it took less than a decade for hyperinflation to set in and their economy to collapse from zimbabwe to argentina there have been countless examples of fiat money failing spectacularly often these are cases in which the absolute worst case occurred the complete collapse of money led to economic ruin the threat of hyperinflation is always present in fiat systems but many developed nations have been able to manage their monetary systems to avoid this type of collapse the usd is just one example since its departure from the gold standard the u s has maintained its status as a world power despite massive increases in the national debt and m1 money supply many argue that the dollar is our leading export and it is evident the u s government has not been shy when it comes to its power of money creation this has resounding implications for everyone using the usd holding fiat means that you are continuously losing value and in order to beat inflation you have to create a diversified investment portfolio the wealthy can plow their money into equities real estate and commodities which bubble up from all the easy money while those without access to these investments see their purchasing power decline this is a classic case of the rich getting richer and is attributable to inflationary monetary policies notice the chart below and what happens right around 1971 when fiat money was born in the u s source center on budget policy npr since you know your dollar will be worth less tomorrow than it is today you are incentivized to have a high time preference and to spend more now if you don t have the money to spend but lots of money is generally available you might take out debt because you know those goods you want need will only cost more tomorrow inflationary regimes lead to more spending less saving and larger indebtedness as we see today in a society drowning in debt this begs the question what other forms of money have succeeded for longer periods of time the obvious answer is gold and most people are familiar with its use as money but haven t given much thought to why in addition to gold humans have also used other commodities such as shells or rai stones to transact because they held certain desirable characteristics to varying degrees they were secure from loss theft scarce difficult to counterfeit easily measurable divisible over time goods that held these desirable characteristics outlived others insert obligatory nick szabo article on the origins of money the not so modern modern monetary theory while the idea of valuable commodity money makes sense to some most of the conversation today is gravitating towards a school of thought with a diametric viewpoint known as modern monetary theory mmt the foundations of this viewpoint known as modern monetary theory mmt date back to the early 20th century with george knapp s the state theory of money this theory directly contradicts the prior notion that money holds value due to its desirable characteristics knapp argues that money is a creation of law and derives its value from the state and its requirement that taxes be paid in their native currency the degree of moneyness is a result of acceptability with the ultimate form of acceptance as payment to the government this theory also known as chartalism was further refined in the credit theory of money by a mitchell innes which postulates money is a liability imposed by the state to measure obligations when you buy groceries you are taking on debt and measuring it with that fiat currency acts as an iou so the grocer then has a debt owed to them with which they can again redeem for something valuable using the currency this seems to suggest that money has no intrinsic value directly rejecting the prior idea of sound commodity money the market is no longer a place where goods are exchanged but simply a clearinghouse for settling debits and credits while the sound money view says humans began with barter and transitioned to using goods with desirable characteristics to transact in order to solve the double coincidence of wants the chartalist view says we progressed from shells to gold coins to fiat as a result of finding more efficient means to track debt this explains the desire to transition away from the gold standard since redemptions of paper notes for gold coins are merely the exchange of one form of obligation for another that s identical in practice the notion of an asset backed currency is one in which the government s flexibility to control the money supply is restricted subscribing to this chartalist view of money leads one to arrive at some interesting policy conclusions in today s world only sovereign governments claim this ability to impose liabilities on others because they can create demand by requiring taxes to be paid in that same government liability therefore a government has no need to balance its budget and spending can greatly outpace tax revenue since the difference can be covered by the creation of more money i e debt mmt economists believe that governments can create as much debt as they want so long as there is adequate demand for their currency from state imposed obligations in theory governments can finance themselves strictly through issuing currency until inflation rises to a point where taxes need to be levied to increase the demand side of money to keep pace with supply if that s too much of a mouthful former fed chairman alan greenspan sums it up the united states can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that so there is zero probability of default google search trends for modern monetary theory mmt in the 21st century while the underpinnings of mmt are not new there has been a strong resurgence of these ideas in recent years from both sides of the political spectrum the modern belief is that the government can run perpetual deficits to fund wars or pay for universal healthcare if these policies don t work as intended and lead to financial distress they can simply print more money on paper the chartalist view of money might make sense you look around the world and every form of money with mainstream adoption is required by the state to be paid in taxes therefore one could conclude that what makes it valuable is this requirement however a truly competitive market has not been possible to challenge the hegemony of fiat money every attempt from liberty dollars to e gold was shut down by the government the state has and will go to great lengths to maintain financial control over its citizens enter bitcoin this all changed a decade ago when pseudonymous author satoshi nakamoto wrote the bitcoin white paper and released his monetary experiment to the world that fundamentally challenged the core beliefs of mmt the decentralized nature of bitcoin meant that even if the state wanted to shut it down it would be an incredibly difficult project to kill at a certain scale this new form of money was able to exist out in the wild allowing for the first time the possibility of a true competitor to fiat money recall that the chartalist belief is that money has value because of its acceptability by the state this thinking would lead one to believe that an asset looking to be used as currency should not be desired unless it can be used to pay taxes yet despite not operating as legal tender it has led to millions of people across the world demand it for its desirable characteristics bitcoin has built a robust social contract with its users and for that reason has a network value of 160 billion nearly a million active addresses and 17 million being spent every day to secure the network data from onchainfx this contract is described in the following only the owner of a coin can produce the signature to spend it confiscation resistance anyone can transact and store value in bitcoin without permission censorship resistance there will only be 21 million bitcoins issued on a predictable schedule inflation resistance all users should be able to verify the rules of bitcoin counterfeit resistance these unique features are what have allowed the unlikely outcome of bitcoin s relative success not because it is accepted by the state not because it is an effective means of tracking debt so what if you rebut the core assumptions upon which an argument is made then you have destroyed the argument mmt argues that money isn t valuable because of its characteristics yet bitcoin has accrued value and achieved usage solely because of them since people value money for its inherent nature in the long run money that is susceptible to be printed at the whims of the government won t be as successful as one that is not we ve seen this play out in extreme situations where nations abuse their money creating abilities and their currency becomes worthless as users adopt more sound money in a world absent free market competition besides fiat this has traditionally been the u s dollar however now that satoshi has introduced bitcoin those living in places where modern monetary policies are rampant can now opt for an alternative the u s dollar has long been a safe haven asset but if these policies continue unobstructed that could change note the next bitcoin halving will lower inflation below the u s target rate this will not likely be an expedient process money is a social construct that takes decades if not centuries to become entrenched in everyday life but if you recognize the second and third order effects of fiat money and its abuses then you should be open to the sound money alternative that is bitcoin
beijing china s economy flashed more warning signs in may as the united states ramped up trade pressure with industrial output growth unexpectedly slowing to a more than 17 year low and investment cooling underlining a need for more stimulus hours after the surprisingly weak data china s central bank announced 300 billion yuan 43 billion in fresh support for smaller banks though analysts expect more sweeping measures in coming months if the u s sino trade dispute intensifies despite a slew of support steps since last year china s economy is still struggling to get back on firmer footing and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world s two largest economies could trigger a global recession industrial output grew 5 0 percent in may from a year earlier data from the national bureau of statistics showed on june 14 missing analysts expectations of 5 5 percent and well below april s 5 4 percent the reading was the weakest since early 2002 and exports were a major drag showing only marginal growth fixed asset investment also grew less than expected reinforcing expectations that beijing needs to roll out more growth measures soon the weakness in may s and april s activity data suggests that economic growth is likely to slow this quarter and increases the likelihood of additional monetary easing in the coming months capital economics said in a note vice premier liu he stoked expectations of more action on thursday urging regulators to do more to boost the economy analysts at goldman sachs said in a note they expect authorities to further cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrrs to free up more funds to lend and lower interbank interest rates but they do not expect china to actively use currency depreciation to support the economy real estate investment a key economic driver also showed signs of fatigue with construction starts slowing markedly and property sales falling the most since october 2017 real estate models are on display in beijing on april 9 2011 lintao zhang getty images the slowdown in the real estate sector is concerning we really need to keep an eye on its negative impact on growth economists at anz said in a note to clients trimming its 2019 growth forecast for china to 6 2 percent and 6 percent for 2020 anz expects the peoples bank of china pboc to cut rrr by another 100 basis points bps this year and lower the 7 day reverse repo rate by 5 bps in the third quarter the pboc has already slashed rrr six times since early 2018 in a bid to turnaround soft credit growth it has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower however despite the worsening trade outlook china watchers appear divided over whether the central bank will cut benchmark interest rates as it repeatedly did in past downturns analysts believe policymakers are concerned more aggressive easing could fuel debt risks and put more pressure on the yuan which is weakening towards the psychologically important 7 per dollar level last seen in the global crisis beijing has relied more on fiscal stimulus to weather the latest downturn including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies but friday s data suggested domestic demand remains sluggish adding to weaker than expected import and bank lending data over the last week and gloomy may factory surveys power generation last month grew just 0 2 percent analysts say china is readying itself for a prolonged trade dispute after both sides raised tariffs on each other s goods last month and president donald trump threatened more but global policymakers remain cautious ahead of a meeting between trump and chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month our baseline forecast assumes that u s china relations will not improve much in the foreseeable future oxford economics said investment disappoints fixed asset investment growth decelerated to 5 6 percent in january may from the same period a year earlier analysts had expected it to remain unchanged from 6 1 percent in the first four months of the year private sector fixed asset investment which accounts for about 60 percent of total investment also lost momentum it rose 5 3 percent down from 5 5 percent the pboc has repeatedly urged state controlled banks to keep lending to cash strapped smaller private firms at lower rates even if they are facing short term financial difficulty but average rates edged back up in the first quarter the state takeover of troubled regional lender baoshang bank in may has added to concerns about liquidity and financial risks anz said while the pboc said it was an isolated case the move jarred china s credit markets amid worries that the lending push will lead to more bad loans the central bank said late on friday that it will raise the re discount quota by 200 billion yuan 28 88 billion and the standing lending facility quota by 100 billion yuan for small and medium sized banks roads and rail infrastructure investment grew 4 0 percent in the first five months on year moderating from 4 4 percent while construction has picked up as beijing ramps up spending on road rail and port projects some analysts have been puzzled by the slower than expected response on monday china announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility so they can increase infrastructure spending property investment rose 9 5 percent in may according to reuters calculations the slowest pace so far this year retail sales bucked the downbeat trend rising 8 6 percent in may on year and picking up from 7 2 percent in april a 16 year low analysts surveyed by reuters had expected a rebound to 8 1 percent but some said it was likely due to higher inflation rather than a turnaround in weak consumer confidence earlier this week china s auto association reported the worst ever monthly drop in sales on a positive note nationwide unemployment readings were steady from april at 5 percent though analysts believe the actual jobless rate is likely much higher by stella qiu kevin yao

it s the lowest reading since december 2012 businessnz s executive director for manufacturing catherine beard said that the drop in activity to its lowest point in over six years was obviously a concern especially when the sub index values are examined she added production 46 4 was at its lowest value since april 2012 while the other key sub index of new orders 50 4 only just managed to stay in positive territory given the latter feeds through into the former it does not instil a strong belief that the sector will show solid improvement over the next few months bnz senior economist doug

how neoliberalism destroyed the democratic party zach toillion follow 7 min read jun 13 2019 2 share in politics and history past is prologue to quote mark twain history doesn t repeat itself but it rhymes as the democratic primary continues to heat up looking at the last three democratic presidents is instructive on how we got to this point in us history and what may happen if another democrat is elected put simply the last three democratic presidents turned their backs on the people they were supposed to champion instead they became proselytizers in the cult of neoliberalism an ideology so bereft of popular supporter it has led to the rise of populism worldwide it all started in iowa with a peanut farmer running for the presidency in 1975 this is the story of how neoliberalism took over and defined the democratic party jimmy carter jimmy carter campaigned as a conservative outright stating he was more similar to dwight eisenhower than a new dealer in his stump speech and ads he stated i believe in balanced budgets i believe in eliminating programs that have outlived their usefulness i believe when there is a choice to be made between government and private industry i d go with the private industry this is a kind of concept that is generally considered to be conservative carter often described himself as a fiscal conservative and campaigned on balancing the federal budget carter was also one of the first candidates to actively campaign on his religiosity as a major selling point

united states increased trade pressure with industrial output growth unexpectedly slowing to a more than 17 year low and investment cooling underlining a need for more stimulus hours after the surprisingly weak data came out china s central bank announced 300 billion yuan 58 1 billion in fresh support for smaller banks although analysts expect more sweeping measures in coming months if the u s sino trade dispute intensifies despite a slew of support steps since last year china s economy is still struggling to get back on firmer footing and investors fear a longer and costlier trade war between the world s two largest economies could trigger a global recession industrial output grew 5 0 per cent in may from a year earlier data from the chinese national bureau of statistics showed on friday missing analysts expectations of 5 5 per cent and well below april s 5 4 per cent the reading was the weakest since early 2002 and exports were a major drag showing only marginal growth fixed asset investment also grew less than expected reinforcing expectations beijing needs to roll out more growth measures soon the weakness in may s and april s activity data suggests that economic growth is likely to slow this quarter and increases the likelihood of additional monetary easing in the coming months capital economics said in a note chinese vice premier liu he stoked expectations of more action on thursday urging regulators to do more to boost the economy and saying beijing has plenty of tools it can use analysts at goldman sachs said in a note they expect authorities to further cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrrs to free up more funds to lend and lower interbank interest rates but they do not expect china to actively use currency depreciation to support the economy real estate investment a key economic driver also showed signs of fatigue with construction starts slowing markedly and property sales falling the most since october 2017 the slowdown in the real estate sector is concerning we really need to keep an eye on its negative impact on growth economists at anz said in a note to clients trimming its 2019 growth forecast for china to 6 2 per cent and 6 per cent for 2020 anz expects the peoples bank of china pboc to cut rrr by another 100 basis points this year and lower the seven day reverse repo rate by five basis points in the third quarter the pboc has already slashed rrr six times since early 2018 in a bid to turnaround soft credit growth it has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower however despite the worsening trade outlook china watchers appear divided over whether the central bank will cut benchmark interest rates as it repeatedly did in past downturns analysts believe policy makers are concerned more aggressive easing could fuel debt risks and put more pressure on the yuan which is weakening toward the psychologically important seven per u s dollar level last seen in the global crisis beijing has relied more on fiscal stimulus to weather the latest downturn including hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending and tax cuts for companies but friday s data suggested domestic demand remains sluggish adding to weaker than expected import and bank lending data over the past week and gloomy may factory surveys power generation last month grew just 0 2 per cent analysts say china is readying itself for a prolonged trade dispute after both sides raised tariffs on each other s goods last month and u s president donald trump threatened more but global policy makers remain cautious ahead of a meeting between mr trump and chinese counterpart xi jinping at a group of 20 summit later this month our baseline forecast assumes that u s china relations will not improve much in the foreseeable future oxford economics said investment disappoints fixed asset investment growth decelerated to 5 6 per cent in january may from the same period a year earlier analysts had expected it to remain unchanged from 6 1 per cent in the first four months of the year private sector fixed asset investment which accounts for about 60 per cent of total investment also lost momentum it rose 5 3 per cent down from 5 5 per cent the pboc has repeatedly urged state controlled banks to keep lending to cash strapped smaller private firms at lower rates even if they are facing short term financial difficulty but average rates edged back up in the first quarter the state takeover of troubled regional lender baoshang bank in may has added to concerns about liquidity and financial risks anz said while the pboc said it was an isolated case the move jarred china s credit markets amid worries that the lending push will lead to more bad loans the central bank said late on friday that it will raise the rediscount quota by 200 billion yuan and the standing lending facility quota by 100 billion yuan for small and medium sized banks roads and rail infrastructure investment grew 4 0 per cent in the first five months on year moderating from 4 4 per cent while construction has picked up as beijing increases spending on road rail and port projects some analysts have been puzzled by the slower than expected response on monday china announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility so they can increase infrastructure spending property investment rose 9 5 per cent in may according to reuters calculations the slowest pace so far this year retail sales bucked the downbeat trend rising 8 6 per cent in may on year and picking up from 7 2 per cent in april a 16 year low analysts surveyed by reuters had expected a rebound to 8 1 per cent but some said it was likely due to higher inflation rather than a turnaround in weak consumer confidence earlier this week china s auto association reported the worst ever monthly drop in sales on a positive note nationwide unemployment readings were steady from april at 5 per

source tnf noble but not enough the zimbabwe independent june 14 2019 president emmerson mnangagwa last week launched the tripartite negotiating forum tnf a platform that brings together government business and labour to discuss challenges affecting the country this is a step in the right direction as it gives labour business and government a platform to discuss pertinent issues affecting the economy editor s memo faith zaba it comes at a time when the country is reeling from skyrocketing prices an acute liquidity crisis job losses and company closures under this forum government and the social partners can engage on key issues such as price increases labour remuneration and opportunist behaviour by business while it is a very good initiative on its own it does not resolve the economic and social problems bedevilling the country one of the key issues the three parties will engage on is the skyrocketing prices however what government has to remember is that rising prices is a manifestation of unstable fundamentals when the fundamentals are stable as the country saw between 2009 and 2015 prices remain constant during that period the multi currency was still working and hence currency and exchange rate stability the destabilisation started the moment bond notes were introduced in 2016 due to foreign currency shortages caused by various factors including dwindling exports diaspora remittances and foreign direct investment as well as money laundering which resulted in the siphoning of the united states dollars out of zimbabwe the introduction of the bond notes coupled with the citizens over reliance on the rtgs and government financing certain expenses and the budget deficit using treasury bills destabilised the country s financial system leading to the volatility of the local currency and rising inflation the following issues need to be dealt as the three parties put their heads together to try and resolve the economic malaise key among the issues is the currency and exchange rate issue the country needs a final solution to the currency crisis unfortunately mnangagwa s announcement that his government will introduce a new currency at the end of the year only brings uncertainty while the forum is a noble initiative enabling the three parties to engage the government must first deal with production levels exports inflation and interest rates government should play its part to provide an enabling environment for business through progressive consistent and predictable policies as well as ease of doing business reforms this instils confidence in the economy inducing its stability mistrust between and among government business and labour can be cured if government acts responsibly in terms of implementing sound policies they say confidence is the cheapest economic stimulus inducing its stability mistrust between and among government business and labour can be cured if government acts responsibly in terms of implementing sound policies they say confidence is the cheapest economic stimulus corruption is a serious malady wasting away this country government needs to tackle high level corruption government must not take the tnf as an opportunity to lecture labour and business on its sins of omission and commission it needs to deal with its hygienic matters ensure an enabling business operating environment and most of the tensions between and among its labour and business partners will vanish business on its part should adopt innovation as a culture in order to reduce potential points of friction with government in terms of key enablers of production such as power and infrastructure for instance in terms of power business should seriously consider embracing green power generation technologies and other alternative power sources instead of pontificating ad nauseam about government s strategic planning deficiencies in power development and planning power can be generated from waste in south africa ppc powers one of its cement factories using waste tyres solar is a quick win extra capacity can be fed into the national grid government for its part needs to expedite enabling legislation on independent power producers this is an example of how business and government guided by vision 2030 can jointly solve challenges and businesses cannot increase prices astronomically but deny workers wage increases the pay gap within companies needs to be rationalised so that all workers get decent remuneration this powers economic growth and reduces extreme levels of corruption while the tnf is a noble initiative it is not enough the tnf should not deal with symptoms but should go to the root cause of the numerous problems afflicting the country

karachi the rupee dipped in both the markets on thursday with the local currency closing an all time low of 153 50 to a dollar in open trade as the country is attuning itself to a potential imf s 6 billion loan program that calls for exchange rate adjustment the central bank s closing data showed that the rupee fell around one percent or rs1 34 to settle at 152 90 dollar compared with the wednesday s close of 151 56 in the interbank market tracking a weaker rupee in the official market the rupee lost rs1 50 to close at 153 50 to the dollar in the open market it had ended at 152 in previous session a currency dealer said the local unit commenced the day on a much weaker footing having hit a new record low of 153 80 earlier in the session the state bank of pakistan didn t intervene to help the battered rupee the dealer said there was a higher demand from importers later it turned into panic with the lack of support from the central bank said a dealer yaqoob abubakar an analyst at tresmark an application that tracks financial markets said the dollar broke two important levels 152 and 153 in quick succession this is due to free float regime and upcoming imf repayments the market seems uncomfortable in next couple of days due to payment pressure pakistan and the international monetary fund imf reached a staff level agreement for the 6 billion loan program that is attached with conditions including market based exchange rate for an approval the imf s board s is likely to give an approval for the 39 month extended fund facility by the end of this month the rupee has lost 9 05 percent this year after falling 37 05 percent in 2018 analysts said the rupee accelerated falls due to increased dollar demand from importers with traders citing the imf s debt repayments pressure pakistan has to make 80 million loan repayment to the imf later this month an analyst said the country had completed a three year 6 4 billion loan program in 2016 analysts said the recent slide was expected as eid holidays just ended home remittances during ramazan were providing a support to rupee but as soon as ramazan finished the dollar started to creep up they added last week the foreign exchange reserves also came down keeping extra pressure on the rupee analysts are expecting weaker rupee throughout this year basing their argument on a fact that the benchmarks and economic targets set with the washington based lender would exert depreciating pressure on the exchange rate traders said the foreign exchange market could go too volatile in coming weeks because of the increasing speculation that the rupee would weaken further until the imf first tranche comes in high debt payments will add to the volatility they said the rupee is expected to touch 160 per dollar next week but the traders said there are chances that the currency would start stabilising after imf inflows which would supply fresh dollars into the market moreover pakistan will get 3 2 billion oil deferred payment facility from saudi arabia from july that would also lower external payment pressure

how socialism presidential election 2020 could affect the gold market the 2020 presidential election is already shaping up to be one of the most bitterly contested in history the outcome could have enormous ramifications for all asset markets including precious metals in the meantime a lot can happen before november 2020 especially with the federal reserve apparently set to turn dovish and cut interest rates this summer some historical research into presidential election cycles suggests that the stock market tends to perform well heading into an election year the incumbent administration tends to focus on padding economic statistics and during election years fed officials who swear up and down they aren t motivated by politics tend to avoid making policy moves such as rate hikes that could make them vulnerable to political attacks gold and silver fared well last time a republican stood for re election gold and silver which are less tied to the economy than stocks show little recent correlation with election years the last time a republican incumbent was up for re election was 2004 incumbent president george w bush faced off against democrat challenger john kerry gold and silver markets performed well in the second half of 2003 and made modest gains in 2004 the metals were in the early stages of a major bull market in 2008 when barack obama and john mccain were vying for the white house the financial crisis hit silver got slammed along with virtually all other assets during that infamous autumn gold however weathered the storm quite well and ended up putting in a gain for the year the stunning election victory of donald trump in 2016 lit a fire under the stock market and put something of a damper on retail demand for physical precious metals in the united states although gold prices are now up since trump s election win and inauguration silver has trended lower and coin and bar demand remains soft compared to the heady years under president obama unlike stocks precious metals tend to benefit from the fear trade if a pro socialist democrat actually wins the white house in 2020 you can bet a lot of investors will decide to hunker down and get defensive gold and silver markets may begin to display an inverse correlation to trends in president trump s poll numbers however larger macro forces now in motion namely steadily rising government debt and accommodative monetary policy will stay in motion through next year s election and beyond regardless of who wins it s only a matter of whether the election results accelerate the debt fueled monetary crisis that is coming if the gop keeps the white house in 2020 it s not necessarily bad news for metals investors recall that when george w bush won re election in november 2004 gold was trading at a mere 450 oz the money metal went on to hit a record 1 000 oz in early 2008 over that same period silver advanced from under 8 oz to over 20 oz importantly precious metals vastly outperformed the stock market through the four years of bush ii s second term radical leftists push democrats to go for broke on spending promises some in the conservative media stamp democrats as suffering from trump derangement syndrome unhinged hatred of the president is only part of what s driving democrats to take increasingly radical positions packing the supreme court abolishing the electoral college abolishing ice censoring the internet medicare for all green new deal etc even before trump the base of the democrat party had been lurching ideologically to the left today democrat candidates are being pushed to reject mixed economy welfare statism and fully embrace socialist doctrines nearly the entire field of democrat presidential candidates has essentially adopted bernie sanders platform one exception former colorado governor john hickenlooper who is running as a pragmatic problem solver with a business background he recently gave a speech to california democrats in which he said socialism was the wrong way to go he was roundly booed meanwhile 76 year old uncle joe biden is disavowing himself to appease far left activists but that is proving to be difficult for him under pressure he suddenly reversed his decades long support of the hyde amendment which bars federal funding of most abortions biden is also trying to play catch up to the trillions in new spending programs proposed by bernie sanders and elizabeth warren clumsily rolling out a partially plagiarized clean energy revolution that would cost the economy at least 5 trillion 2020 prediction winner will embrace more money printing as for senator pocahontas warren has gone off the reservation when it comes to taxing spending and printing currency out of thin air she would pay for her multi trillion dollar progressive wish list by instituting a new wealth tax and pushing the u s dollar lower i e inflation as warren put it her monetary policy vague as it is would entail more actively managing our currency value it sounds like modern monetary theory mmt which is likely coming in one form or another in the years ahead as the government struggles just to pay interest on an exponentially growing debt load under mmt the government would directly print the dollars it needs to close its deficits rather than issue new bonds similar monetary experiments didn t work out so well in zimbabwe and venezuela given president trump s repeated clashes with the federal reserve over what he sees as too tight monetary policy he might be all too willing to support a bipartisan push for a more actively managed more inflationary monetary system investors who are thinking about selling precious metals or refraining from buying until trump leaves office should check their premises

i underwent a stress test of a personal kind at 8 o clock one morning three years ago when i was about to be interviewed on bbc radio s today programme by the formidable john humphrys the subject was bank capital requirements on which i thought the bank of england had adopted a softer than prudent policy stance 1 a few minutes before the interview as the news was being read john humphrys came into the room where i was waiting and said something like this it s a complicated topic we need to make it intelligible to the listeners so is it alright to talk about bank capital as like a pot of money that they keep on one side for a rainy day given the terms in which bankers commentators and alas regulators including central bankers often speak about banks holding capital and so on it is entirely natural that john humphrys would think that the pot of money metaphor was apt but he wasn t sure and he took the trouble to check no it s not like that at all i explained off air thank goodness a pot of money is an asset but equity capital is on the liability side of the balance sheet part of banks funding structure it is the difference between two big numbers the estimated value of their assets and their liabilities i e obligations to depositors bond holders etc he got the point instantly and somehow managed to make the interview both intelligible and free of the pot of money fallacy the fallacy is dangerous not just because it confuses assets and funding it also promotes a spurious sense of precision you can count how much money is in a pot but you can t measure bank capital with much accuracy at all given the potentially huge economic and social costs of bank failure through capital inadequacy this is a serious policy issue indeed the measurement problem is inherent to what banks do among other things they provide liquidity transformation depositors for example can get liquidity on demand while their funds are invested in part in illiquid assets such as loans in the nature of things values of illiquid assets are hard to measure there are accounting measures upon which the edifice of prudential regulation depends and there are market measures the two may come apart however as they did spectacularly in the crisis of a decade ago for a number of major banks they are apart again now and have been for a while what if anything should regulators do about that not worry about it go over to market based measures but then what about the risk of nasty pro cyclical dynamics like many economists i will argue that market based measures should play a greater role in regulatory assessment than is current practice 2 stress tests are an increasingly important element of that practice in particular i will contend that for major banks with price to book ratios less than one stress tests based on market values should be run and published by regulators alongside existing stress test results this could be done in at least two ways which are discussed below simplest and what i mainly have in mind is what i ll call the ex ante method of using market values to calibrate the starting point for the test thus market values would be one basis for setting the initial capital levels that are then subject to stress the ex post method would go further and consider the projected evolution of market values during the stress to test whether the degree of stress is market consistent when i proposed to the bank of england in 2016 that parallel stress tests based on market values be run they responded with a number of counter arguments which i will review below together with some remarks on illiquidity issues and some comments on bank of england stress tests of banks but first with thanks to the imf for the charts here are some facts about banks price to book ratios capital measurement and price to book ratios the theme of the imf s global financial stability report of october 2018 was a decade after the financial crisis are we safer in many respects yes but in the euro area china japan and the united kingdom bank aggregate price to book ratios are less than one this means that the market value of equity is less than the amount of capital booked on bank balance sheets if market valuations are used to calculate capital ratios in place of the balance sheet value of capital used in the regulatory ratios a number of banks would have a market adjusted capitalization of less than 3 per cent the minimum level in the basel iii framework figures 1 and 2 from figure 1 20 in that report illustrate figure 1 bank price to book ratios source imf 2018 figure 1 shows that average price to book ratios are below one in all the regions shown except the us pre crisis they were about two which shows how wrong markets can be but markets reflected the problems emerging through 2007 8 much more quickly than the lagging regulatory numbers figure 2 bank market adjusted capitalisation september 2018 source imf 2018 figure 2 shows banks market adjusted capitalisation by region that is the price to book ratio if less than one times tangible common equity as a proportion of adjusted tangible assets blob size is proportional to assets so bigger banks have bigger blobs on a market adjusted view some major banks have very high leverage despite a decade of reform finally here is a more recent figure from figure 1 5 of the imf s april 2019 global financial stability report figure 3 banks capitalisation and market valuation percent of risk weighted assets ratio source imf 2019 it is evident that banks price to book ratios are well below one and persistently so in much of the world the data in the first and last figure are by region or country so some banks including major ones have ratios substantially lower than the average of which they are part if the market believed book values price to book ratios should substantially exceed one that is because market capitalisation reflects a view of the value of current assets less liabilities plus the franchise value of future profits in excess of the cost of capital plus the option value arising from shareholders limited liability and implicit subsidy book values reflect the first element the future franchise value should be significantly positive given that there is less than perfect competition in banking if management is competent enough not to take on business that is expected to be value reducing and the option value which cannot be negative is positive if there is any possibility of bail out regulatory measures of capital are based on book values but with adjustments thus cet1 rightly excludes some elements of shareholder value that would not absorb loss in a crisis parallel adjustments would be required for capital measures based on market values price to book ratios persistently below one therefore raise the question of whether regulatory measures are accurate a question that should always be in mind anyway stress tests are designed to assess how well the system would deal with a shock they typically assume that we know where we are to begin with before the shock but what if we don t know for sure where we are what if there are reasons to think that we might be in a more vulnerable state pre shock than assumed in the standard type of test stress tests that ignore that possibility are running a serious risk which should be of particular concern to prudential regulators there is the further danger that by ignoring or playing down the risk stress tests might give such false comfort as to be counterproductive saying this does not for a moment suppose that markets always assess value correctly the market could well be taking an unduly pessimistic view but there is a chance that it is not we just don t know the sensible response to uncertainty to ignorance putting it bluntly is to be pluralist neither assume that the market is right nor that accounting numbers are right look at things on both bases and compare them hence the suggestion that it would be good practice for banks with price to book ratios below one for regulators to show capital measures and run stress tests with market implied capital values alongside those based on book values when i made the supplementary stress test suggestion to the bank of england part of the response was that low price to book ratios can be explained by expected future profitability being weak for reasons other than poor asset quality but a bank s obligations to depositors and bondholders are met or not by future cash flows their weakness is a problem or could be whatever the cause of the low ratios and if a systemic crisis hits which is our principal concern the ability to sell assets that might have been good quality pre crisis might well evaporate anyway if regulators have explanations to offer for low price to book ratios those could be published for public scrutiny alongside market based capital ratios sarin and summers 2019 consider whether persistently low interest rates can explain low price to book ratios higher interest rates could boost banks margins on unremunerated deposits and a steeper yield curve could enhance the profitability of maturity transformation more generally indeed the boost to net interest income as sterling interest rates rise is a feature of the bank of england 2018 stress tests on the other hand higher interest rates reduce the value of long term assets held by banks so the effect is mixed in theory and sarin and summers find very little support in the empirical evidence for the proposition that low interest rates explain subdued market views of bank profitability moreover where price to book ratios are substantially below one there is a limit to how much can be explained by weak short term profitability the bank of england used a cost of bank equity as high as 13 together with a five year period of depressed profits to reconcile an average price to book ratio of between 0 7 and 0 8 in 2016 with mainstream assumptions on the risk free rate and the equity premium a 13 cost of equity implies a bank beta of about 2 the profit projections in bank of england stress tests have not in fact been weak figure 4 is from the 2017 exercise figure 4 projections for aggregate profits before tax the blue dotted line shows the baseline i e the central projected profit path in the absence of the stress this rises by tens of billions of pounds relative to the historical data shown in yellow which declined contrary to projections of strong profit growth in prior stress tests the stressed path the purple dotted line is sharply below the baseline in the first couple of years of stress but then rebounds close to the buoyant baseline projection to a level well above the recent path this is a prime reason why banks appear quite resilient to the stress pro cyclicality issues an important objection to the use of market measures in stress tests concerns pro cyclicality that capital as valued by the market would tend to be high in stock market booms and low in slumps while counter cyclical policy should be contractionary in booms and expansionary in slumps a related concern is about the volatility of stress test results but one wonders whether that might be saying more about the banks being tested than the methodology of the test following morris and shin 2016 an illiquidity component of credit risk might in some circumstances be reflected in market prices illiquidity risk is the risk that a solvent bank which would not otherwise have failed fails because of a run by creditors and or because of balance sheet weakening due to fire sales of assets if illiquidity risk is elevated market values might underestimate bank solvency i e the expected value of assets if held to maturity less obligations to creditors if market measures reflecting illiquidity risk drove policy on capital requirements undesirable pro cyclical dynamics could indeed unfold in similar vein the recent paper by plantin and tirole 2018 shows in a theoretical model how beyond a certain point marking to market can adversely affect liquidity in secondary markets for assets but it may be asked why illiquidity would risk be elevated unless there were at least some market doubts about solvency that would itself seem to be important market information with a bearing on the question of whether accounting values can be relied on for regulatory and other purposes moreover considerations of pro cyclicality do not weigh against the use of market measures to calibrate capital when as now for much of the world banks price to book ratios are below one despite economies and stock markets being in a prolonged upswing if they are below one in an upswing what will things be like in a downswing this question is examined in section 4 of sarin and summers 2019 the fed stress tests involve a large drop in the stock market since us bank betas range from about 1 2 to 1 8 the effect on the stock market valuations of banks is magnified further the upshot is that some of the biggest banks have their tangible common equity capital buffers as measured by the market wiped out in the event of such a large fall in the stock market if bank betas increased in severe downturns the effect would be greater still market implied capital losses are estimated to be more than double those in the fed stress tests to use the earlier terminology this analysis is an example of the ex post method of using projected market values as the stress test evolves not just to set their starting positions it asks whether the change in bank capital levels looks market consistent the authors make the caveat that this is an admittedly naïve exercise but it raises important questions if market implied values of bank capital would be substantially below the stressed values based on accounting measures what explains the difference whether or not there are convincing explanations this is a question that deserves an answer of course there are now policy instruments to address pro cyclicality directly notably the counter cyclical capital buffer but little use has been made of it it is set at zero in the us and it is zero in most of europe too despite us not appearing to be in a cyclical slump since the availability of the counter cyclical capital buffer tool has been given as a reason for lowering estimates of optimal baseline capital requirements its net effect on the safety of the banking system has become unclear communication issues a further objection to running alternative supplementary stress tests is to quote bank of england governor mark carney the risk of confusing the bank s communication around its stress tests if we publish two sets of results that give different messages people might struggle to understand what we are trying to say about the resilience of the banking system maybe so but clarity of message should not have priority over stress test rigour where different bases of calculation both of them reasonable deliver different answers about the resilience of the banking system that is important for people to know and it is best that they hear it from the regulators themselves i can however see the awkwardness for a regulator who has been emphasising the resilience of the system of publishing market based measures that may present a different picture but that is what accountability requires and it goes some way towards ameliorating the incentive problem of regulators being perceived as marking their own exam papers when conducting stress tests of a system that they have already declared to be safe and sound and to the extent that it exerted a discipline on such declarations that might be no bad thing conclusion to sum up the stability of the financial system depends on the capital of banks and other financial institutions unlike the amount of money in a pot capital cannot be counted its measurement depends on regulatory accounting methods which as events a decade ago showed dramatically do not always reflect economic realities in a timely fashion market valuations of capital are imperfect too but they deserve systematic attention especially when they appear to be in tension with accounting measures of capital this can and should be done officially as well as academically in various ways in particular for major banks with price to book ratios less than one stress tests based on market values should be run and published by regulators alongside existing stress test results what if they give different answers that big question is for another day but the response must depend on the diagnosis for the difference i can imagine some diagnoses where one would at least question the dividend policy of banks that fail

as the u s china trade war intensified pundits on both sides of the pacific and elsewhere are calculating who is the real winner indeed it is not china or the united states but countries like bangladesh vietnam and chile that could benefit from the widening trade dispute between the world s two biggest economies the impending effect of the trade war on supply chain dynamics and investment patterns could help these countries emerge as potential winners of the conflict for bangladesh china and the united states have been long time stable trade partners the volume and values of trade are very significant with both countries however the nature of trade with both countries is different bangladesh s top import partner is china with bangladesh importing over 15 billion in chinese goods as of 2017 meanwhile the united states is the second largest destination for bangladesh s exports taking in more than 5 8 billion in 2017 germany was the largest destination at just over 6 billion as the asian development bank s chief economist yasuyuki sawada argued bangladesh s exports can be expected to increase by 400 million amid the trade war the garment sector which accounts for 80 percent of bangladesh s total exports is expected to benefit the most as the trade war escalates american retailers are placing more work orders in bangladesh in an effort to offset increasing tariffs on goods manufactured in china according to the bangladesh foreign trade institute bangladesh enjoyed a 6 46 percent growth in market share in the u s market during the first three quarters of 2018 in 2012 a report by mckinsey forecasted that as ready made garments from china declined bangladesh would be the next hot spot and the market would triple in value by 2020 up from 15 billion in 2010 even though this forecast was about china s gradual phase out from labor intensive industries to higher value added high tech capital intensive manufacturing sector it seems that trade war is accelerating the growth of bangladesh to achieve just that to avoid higher tariffs factories are relocating from china to elsewhere in asia bangladesh has more competitive advantages than its competitors such as cambodia and vietnam due to the presence of strong unions setting up factories in cambodia is more challenging moreover in contrast to the 160 million bangladeshis cambodia has a population of just 16 million which gives bangladesh a competitive edge in this labor intensive industry due to higher wages and production costs vietnam also looks less attractive to investors the minimum wage in bangladesh is currently 95 per month which is almost half the 182 per month it is in cambodia and 180 per month in hanoi and ho chi minh city bangladesh can also benefit by increasing imports from the united states according to the u s farm bureau soybean exports to china declined by 97 percent after china s tariffs on u s soybeans came into effect at the moment bangladesh imports 2 million tons of crude vegetable oil of which 30 percent or 600 000 tons is soybeans currently 98 percent of those soybeans comes from argentina paraguay and brazil if the country can redirect its supply chain from latin america to the united states it may have the potential to supply oil to consumers at cheaper prices without sacrificing profits in the long run moreover being the 51st largest trading partner of the united states bangladesh enjoys a 4 billion trade surplus one of u s president donald trump s hobby horses is going after trade surplus countries by importing soybeans from the united states bangladesh can benefit both by getting goods at a cheaper rate and reducing the trade deficit this may ultimately contribute to stronger bilateral relations furthermore bangladesh and other low income countries in south asia face u s duties of 15 2 percent of the total value of exports which has a possibility to ease if the united states wants to increase imports from these countries to minimize its gap from china the majority of bangladesh s steel demands come from importing scrap iron from united states and its domestic shipbreaking industry however the u s imposed a 25 percent tariff on all steel imports in march 2018 in efforts to revitalize its declining steel industry this action led u s suppliers of scrap iron to store their reserves in anticipation of higher tariffs consequently bangladesh has seen a significant rise in the price of rods an important product required for its many infrastructure projects in 2017 bangladesh scrapped 25 percent of the ships dismantled worldwide in light of growing development projects the country might craft an industrial policy to develop its shipbreaking yards hoping to sourcing a greater amount of cheaper steel domestically which is already providing more than half of the country s steel supply on the purview of a trade war although chinese policymakers are seeking to tighten capital flows in hopes of preventing a depreciation of the yuan china s increasing involvement in various projects in bangladesh may mean constraints will not be as effective additionally bangladesh has seen an increase in fdi from china higher than forecasted through factory relocations especially in the growing export processing zones epzs furthermore as a member of belt and road initiative bri it is more meaningful for china to increase investment in bangladesh in those sectors which are affected in china by the trade war beijing s support of bangladesh was evident in the 27 agreements for investments and loans signed by the two countries in the amount of 24 billion when president xi jinping visited in 2016 net fdi from china into bangladesh exploded after xi s visit it increased to 506 million in the 2017 18 financial year up from only 68 5 million in 2016 17 according to the bangladeshi newspaper the financial express putting all this together it appears that the trade war between the united states and china opened for bangladesh a window of opportunity however whether the country can reap the benefits will depend on a host of factors bangladesh is struggling with crumbling infrastructure weak rule of law and a poor business environment many observers have also been alarmed at the bangladeshi government s excessive and reckless borrowing from china and worry it may put the country in a longer term debt trap like other countries it is therefore critical for bangladesh to work on a favorable policy regime to seize new opportunities as they come and to provide enabling conditions for more foreign direct investment while also avoiding unintended risks and consequences anu anwar is an affiliate scholar at east west center and a fellow at the pacific forum young leaders program hawaii united states
by in cormac mccarthy s consummate work of apocalyptic dread the road about a perished world the narrator dreams of life with his former bride a mere memory come to haunt his cold nights yet rather than embrace such crepuscular balms he finds them suspicious he mistrusted all of that he said the right dreams for a man in peril were dreams of peril and all else was the call of langour and of death i imagine this is how neoliberals think about socialism as a call of langour and death fearful of being gulled by fantasies they resist idealistic barnstormers with the same intensity with which they reject base fascists there must be some deep inbuilt bias against reachable idealism in some and against unpleasant truths in others but the latter seem more numbersome and yet so much of the world we inhabit in all its gray capitalist drudgery in all its gaudy pomp its tatty circumstance its bricolage culture is a product of our acquiescence the notion of the unreachable distance of the ideal may represent more a failure of collective imagination than a material impediment how many of us are convinced that there is no alternative to capitalism how many have ingested that neoliberal narcotic of foreclosed imaginations then as a nation of small minds we accept the tutelage of small men we acquiesce to the dimmed horizons of candidates like former vice president joe biden whose cheaply bought lunchpail posturing is a transparent farce to anyone with a passing knowledge of his record his like is a metastasizing presence on a crowded campaign trail the elder biden is flanked by moderate republican beto o rourke doing his best to be obama lite a young idealistic avatar of hope full of windy platitudes and a believer s mien elizabeth warren whose latest brainstorm is to make the violent hegemonic armed forces more environmentally friendly a kind of last consolation on the downslope to extinction new york mayor bill de blasio whose cheery multiculturalism faintly veils a familiar and spineless centrism self absorbed kathleen harris who giggles at jailing truants and friend of the people friend of pharma cory booker yet the half of the electorate that remains engaged in the roiling fraud of elections quickly fall to debating the manifold vices and minor virtues of these candidates petitioners all for the role of caretaker of the public weal and all of this this wan acceptance this it is what it is ism this dread of dreams is itself a product of media conditioning i think it was deepak chopra of all people who said the dream of social conditioning is only escaped by sages and psychotics which is why if media is the culprit of our condition then capturing media should be the letter of transit to a social consciousness of a different kind after all the february revolution in russia unseated the tsar but put the bourgeoisie in its place who happily went about shedding what radical garb they transiently wore the bolsheviks understood this wasn t enough and rather than try to stage a new rebellion on the heels of that one instead went into the countryside to convince the workers and peasants that february wasn t enough only then did october come but to take stock of the present situation or current affairs as barnes noble would so blandly have it is an exercise in incredulity looking about oneself the media landscape is littered with one garbage heap after another filth factories that sunnily prostitute themselves to power the doxies of journalism nearly blotting out the horizon sycophant ngos one of the crucial aspects of media propaganda is the use of apparently authoritative sources this is done in a couple of ways one is to establish new organizations that parade themselves beneath a banner of impartiality but do the work of elite capital the syrian observatory for human rights propornot and the alliance for securing democracy and its infamous hamilton 68 dashboard supposedly designed to identify russian bots on social media the national endowment for democracy created in the reagan era is perhaps a seminal example of the creation of front organizations that profess neutral and angelic intentions while in actuality work to savage the reputation of progressive movements domestically and internationally perhaps an even better way to deliver ostensibly authoritative news to the population is by co opting existing organizations this has been effectively done across a range of international institutions think of the bretton woods institutions of the international monetary fund the world bank originating out of the international bank for reconstruction and development etc all have more or less been captured by washington s neoliberal zealotry think of congress for that matter but for matters of imperial aggression few organizations are better situated to sway public opinion than longstanding ngos which has in recent years fallen afoul of american subversion once compromised their findings can be usefully employed by the msm to solidify arguments in favor of imperial violence crucially under the guise of humanitarian goodwill take for instance amnesty international once and still perceived to some extent as a kind of pillar of rectitude in a boozy braindead consumer culture that ngo has made itself supplicant to washington and was perhaps always anxious to evade the censure of the metropole it now openly campaigns for war of course it varies the lexicon slightly using terms like grave to preface perceived injustices and peppers in suggestive terms like crimes against humanity to stir the juices of the settled intelligentsia those miseducated haute bourgeois that think they know better than the working class despite being sheltered from most of the damage done by neoliberalism once there s a generalized panic afoot about how to put somebody else s house in order amnesty rolls out the heavy artillery this must not go unpunished and that surely requires a vigorous response words like probably and almost certainly are sprinkled into the mix to provide an impression of veracity this is how imperial violence happens it is justified before a boot ever settles on the soft earth of an emerging nation never to emerge precisely because of that folderol from the respectable press human rights watch another turncoat org is led by a kind of frail blue veined savonarola in executive director kenneth roth taking to twitter roth rampages across the media plain on a high horse of pious cant denouncing nicolas maduro as a vicious dictator and supporting the overthrow of the government by a ferociously stupid cabal of neoliberals backed by american power another warmonger roth he is in good company inverting reality for its bylines atlantic writers call the violent opposition of parliamentarian juan guaido pro democracy the wall street journal calls them democratic forces despite maduro s standing as the elected leader of venezuela government forces are often referred to as forces loyal to maduro democracy is canceled when it contravenes imperial capitalism always the now growing animus toward iran a nation that hasn t started a war in centuries has been long reinforced by biased reportage from around the msm it is always anonymous sources from the u s military or from its sprawling corrupt bureaucracy that peddle the state line to credulous young reporters and older disillusioned reporters from the times perhaps guttural utterances whispered in a shadowy oilslick parking garage a fair survey of media coverage on venezuela found that 54 of 76 articles were openly in favor of regime change while the rest either provided a raft of ambiguous banalities while being careful not to oppose the machinations of the garrison state drubbing the idealists if the media is actively supporting imperialism internationally it must fight a companion war on the homefront namely the defeat of progressive movements that call for policies that would threaten the imperial treasury programs like medicare for all easily within reach of a nation that wanted it and whose government represented the populace is considered wildly idealistic and unworkable in the mainstream press which has conditioned an essential slice of the voting population in reality such proposals are banal the argument over single payer has been settled in saner circles but in the fantasyland of the mainstream it is a sensational concept hamstrung by a leftist idealism detached from the reality of elitism hence the blizzard of dismissive prose it s chief proponent vermont independent senator bernie sanders is being quietly shaped as anti american for the upcoming election a delusive scold who clings to the rhetorical tropes of new dealers and anti vietnam protestors having been bypassed by the enlightened wisdom of imperial humanitarianism his press coverage will not amount to half of joe biden s or beto o rourke s he will be calmly buried in the media and then sundered by the sword of his own fealty to neoliberal democrats sanders will doubtless receive more coverage this election largely because in the last he had little name recognition and was easily ignored by the corporate media now that he s a household name it must cover him to maintain its semblance of neutrality that coverage though will be decidedly negative and deceitful attacking his socialist lite programs and absurdly questioning his ability to rally support among his strongest cohorts even before he declared for the presidency biden was scoring major media coverage nearly besting sanders who was crisscrossing the country at seemingly breakneck pace biden seems to have already been anointed as the chosen foot soldier to shepherd imperialism back beneath its tawdry banner of respectability his nascent campaign has already aligned itself with the imperial state like hillary clinton before him biden was a proponent of regime change war in iraq and an architect of a crime bill that laid yet more punitive measures on disenfranchised african americans his efforts to destabilize ukraine on behalf of western capital should not be forgotten either not to mention syria and honduras and other lamentable projects he enthusiastically cheered on prior to being vp during the halcyon days of neoliberal icon barack obama s administration biden was considered to be a rhetorical loose cannon a faithful servant of capital who tried to clothe himself in the blue collar swagger of the working man his collective profile was more pagliacci than paladin it remains to be seen whether the corporate media will be able to craft a suitably presidential persona for this graft happy grifter one image prevails in your author s mind served up no doubt in one of the msm s countless insider paeans to the obama administration it is the image of biden marching around the white house a crazed grin on his face the starry eyed face of a witless acolyte telling himself again and again that general motors was alive and bin laden was dead as if this bizarre polarity was all the proof the ersatz delaware senator needed to know that obama had resurrected american exceptionalism and perhaps it was narrative rollback and a culture of death mainstream america indifferent to art enthralled by money ignorant of history is the outgrowth of a triptych of vile powers the neoliberal party the imperial state and the capitalist media each of these entities has vested interests in advancing the cause of violent western hegemony it is the media though and the control of media that casts the patina of legitimacy on the party and state which enable it to act with relative impunity to reinforce the false historical narrative and reign in the increasingly rogue cabal of soothsayers roaming the ridges of the web a vast social media crackdown and pitiless prosecution of whistleblowers has doubtless had a chilling effect on alternative news sources their visibility has been and will be dramatically diminished and the almost unimaginable courage and risk taking of people like julian assange and chelsea manning to out state crimes will be sorely tested by the limitless power of the espionage act as alternative forms of fact finding are rolled back the mainstream narratives will again assume an authority they neither have nor deserve all of this is typically nothing new the story of eugene debs is a reminder of the wantonness of state power the wilson led entry into the first world war of the power of the state to shape public opinion as austerity and inflation bites deeper into our quality of life the government will becoming increasingly fascist and reactionary as our deranged commander in chief reminds us daily the bourgeois intellectual culture we live beneath is ethically and spiritually bankrupt it can rationalize away any and all cruelties in the name of democracy the imparting of false crimes to foreign states and the savaging of domestic proposals for social uplift are the least of it the latest international targets include venezuela and nicaragua of course but these embargoes and sanctions and cheaply rationalized crimes can be traced nearly word for word to the eighties when the national review and wall street journal among many others were sniffing about exporting democracy to wayward latin nations and quite openly countenancing huge civilian casualties if the result was democracy this was when hollywood b lister ronald reagan was hyperventilating about communism and declared nicaragua an extraordinary threat to the united states instancing the contra wars barack obama resuscitated this halfwit measure when he targeted venezuela during his second term calling it too an extraordinary threat to national security donald trump has resurrected a sociopathic reagan foot soldier in elliot abrams to manage the latest regime change efforts in the southern hemisphere all in the name of democracy a word flung about the mediascape amid pithy emotional outbursts as pundits declare themselves terribly worried about the wellbeing of latinos thousands of miles away though of another class of another tongue and another reviled political disposition hiding in plain print yet the corporate use of the word democracy has no relation to the word s philosophical definition it is merely a portmanteau for all manner of plunder the techniques of which include first evicting the wayward socialist in power by sanction or sabotage or shotgun then implanting a pliable stooge in power implementing economic austerity and selling off state owned assets held in the name of the people to u s multinationals meanwhile the population stews in a cauldron of social and economic chaos the pundits then clamor to administer more of the same calling it a cure but knowing it isn t the wreckage entrained by this turn of events is nearly wholly hidden by the corporate press but the events occur nonetheless the pliable stooges are referred to in communist lore as comprador elite effectively washington buys off an elitist in the target country there are always plenty most of them educated in some american re education camp disguised as an ivy league elysium and supplies him or her with a prefabricated policy playbook drawn up inside the beltway by congeries of chicago school fantasists then our obtuse organs of capitalist oligarchy will provide military aid in the form of weapons and training that will almost certainly be necessary to put down the social unrest caused by the austerity policies austerity means slashing social spending which depletes economic demand which shrinks the economy which causes international lenders read washington directed banks to step in wringing their hands in brotherly concern for their latin lessers and hold out a dollar based loan package stippled with conditionalities these conditions include budget caps the violation of which will trigger punitive measures and the dropping of tariff regimes that protect domestic industry in favor of fdi or foreign direct investment a pseudo economic term for a firesale of national resources at deep discounts to foreign corporations this is also referred to as privatization which is said to be necessary in order to raise funds for the government to pay back the onerous loan which was naturally signed off on by the comprador elite in charge a traitor who betrays his own population impoverishes them and fences their own wealth for what amounts to a transaction fee which he then pockets before absconding to foreign climes think of the shah of iran being granted admission to the united states for medical treatment after being chased from the country by the revolution this makes the loan odious as well as onerous but this is disregarded by the debt collectors additional costs come in the form of externalities the second best trick of capitalist exploitation the first is when capital captures the surplus value from labor which means you will never be paid your true worth in a capitalist system the second is when capital socializes the steep costs of production here the costs often materialize in the form of ecological depredations as when corporations strip mine mountaintops see west virginia or jharkhand india where slag and sulfur wreck native habitats these actions often proceed protected by the infamous mou or memorandum of understanding that permits domestic and foreign corporations to mine under the aegis of the federal state yet how much of this is shared in the tepid correspondence between the monolithic institutions of corporate media and their million minor outlets coda to media crimes mccarthy s the road delivers a far bleaker picture than the one just described but it articulates and anticipates a possible outcome of our puerile system of social organization a system which decimates our land disfigures our psyches deforms our bodies and desiccates our dreams on behalf of a chiseling syndicate of elites elites who appear to neither know nor feel compassion except for their blood relations which are presently being primed to assume the mantle of exploitation once decrepitude descends on their vile forbearers all the more reason to uproot corporate media and begin the mind work of calling a population back to its truer instincts where peaceful cooperation trumps cutthroat competition those instincts are currently papered over by a phalange of specious argument emotional manipulation and the bludgeon of perpetual news the elites that helm this system of deceits were recently sharing new world order ideas over champagne and canapes in switzerland at their annual bilderberg summit breathlessly sketching their latest vision for the planet one we will neither see nor vote on until it is visibly underway

last summer my colleague brunello rosa and i identified 10 potential downside risks that could trigger a us and global recession in 2020 nine of them are still in play today many involve the united states trade wars with china and other countries along with restrictions on migration foreign direct investment and technology transfers could have profound implications for global supply chains raising the threat of stagflation slowing growth alongside rising inflation and the risk of a us growth slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course meanwhile us equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary and there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt including in many emerging markets where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies with central banks ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to flash crashes and other disruptions one such disruption could come from us president donald trump who may be tempted to create a foreign policy crisis wag the dog with a country such as iran that might bolster his domestic poll numbers but it could also trigger an oil shock beyond the us the fragility of growth in debt ridden china and some other emerging markets remains a concern as do economic policy financial and political risks in europe worse across the advanced economies the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today the tenth factor that we considered was the us federal reserve s interest rate policy after hiking rates in response to the trump administration s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the fed reversed course in january looking ahead the fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy while trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply side risk they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income with so much uncertainty companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 compared to 5 25 in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing qe central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and as rosa and i argued last year financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020 the sino american trade and technology war deserves special attention the conflict could escalate further in several ways the trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the 300bn worth of chinese exports not yet affected or prohibiting huawei and other chinese firms from using us components could trigger a full scale process of de globalisation as companies scramble to secure their supply chains were that to happen china would have several options for retaliating against the us such as by closing its market to us multinationals such as apple under such a scenario the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis regardless of what the major central banks do with the current tensions already denting business consumer and investor confidence and slowing global growth further escalation would tip the world into a recession and given the scale of private and public debt another financial crisis would likely follow from that sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk both trump and chinese president xi jinping know that it is in their countries interest to avoid a global crisis so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit for tat measures trump and xi each seem to think that his country s long term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war and if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed it is possible that trump and xi will meet for talks during the g20 summit on june 28 29 in osaka but even if they do agree to restart negotiations a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off as the two sides drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is rising nouriel roubini is a professor at nyu s stern school of business and was senior economist for international affairs in the clinton white house s council of economic advisers he has worked for the imf the us federal reserve and the world bank project syndicate
gbp usd has been falling as the usd resumed its gains the bank of england s decision further rounds of the conservative contest and the fed stand out the daily chart for the third week of june remains bearish the fx poll points to falls in the short term and rises afterward what just happened bracing for boris usd strength boris johnson has one foot at 10 downing street the former foreign secretary has overwhelmingly won the first round of the conservative party s leadership contest with 114 votes leaving his closest competitors far behind he is all but certain to be on the shortlist that the party s membership will vote on and he is very popular among members in his launch event johnson has said the uk must leave the eu by the october 31st deadline on the other hand he has refused to commit to stepping down if he does not deliver brexit on time see boris johnson launch analysis three statements that may lift gbp usd in the meantime the uk economy has been struggling according to the latest data gdp fell by 0 4 in april the month after the country was supposed to leave the eu economists are unsure if the downturn is temporary or just a response to march s stockpiling on the other hand the unemployment rate has remained at the historic low of 3 8 and wage growth came out at 3 1 above expectations bank of england governor mark carney has refrained from talking about monetary policy in his speech us data has been mixed as well inflation fell short of expectations in may with core consumer prices rising by only 2 year on year on the other hand retail sales not only beat expectations in may but also enjoyed substantial upwards revisions for april casting doubts on far the fed may go with signaling interest rate cuts us sino trade wars have intensified with china saying it will fight until the end and us officials threatening new tariffs on the world s second largest economy if president xi jinping does not meet his american counterpart donald trump uk events boe and the conservative contest the tories will hold additional leadership votes in parliament on tuesday wednesday and thursday after three members have been eliminated in the first round and one stepped down afterward five contenders will compete for the second place behind johnson if foreign secretary jeremy hunt or his colleague rory stewart gain ground the pound may gain as they prefer softer versions of brexit if hardliners such as dominic raab receive support the pound may fall michael gove and sajid javid are somewhere in the middle according to party rules the member with the fewest votes and those who receive fewer than 34 votes in these rounds are eliminated boe governor carney will have two opportunities to move the pound he first appears before a parliament committee on monday and will shed some light on the bank s recent inflation report and its general views about the economy carney is likely to stress that the boe is assuming a smooth brexit and intends to raise interest rates in response to rising inflation markets price in a hike only in mid 2020 inflation figures are scheduled for tuesday headline consumer price index is forecast to slide from 2 1 to 2 0 year on year core prices are projected to suffer a similar decline from 1 8 to 1 7 a steeper fall in inflation may push back retail sales are due on thursday just before the rate decision the volume of sales remained flat in april while core sales fell by 0 2 boe preview carney s second influence on the pound is more significant the boe is set to leave the interest rate unchanged at 0 75 as mentioned earlier the central bank has expressed its desire to raise rates but then there s brexit the rising uncertainty about the uk s exit from the eu is casting a shadow on future policy the old lady assumes a smooth brexit despite johnson opening the door to a no deal brexit will the boe change its assumptions probably not as it would draw criticism the boe has already been criticized as a doomsayer ahead of the 2016 eu referendum however the accompanying meeting minutes may express more concern about future growth due to brexit and global trade tensions and if inflation falls more than expected the boe may lean on weaker price rises to hint it will push back its intentions to raise rates other central banks have already turned dovish and the boe may follow them the ecb has pushed back its rate hike intentions to mid 2020 and some consider a rate cut the fed making its decision on the previous day is also likely to lean towards cuts if the boe removes its hawkish bias the pound may fall here are the events lined up in the uk on the forex calendar us events all eyes on the fed the federal reserve s decision is left right and center the central bank is set to leave interest rates unchanged but is under heavy pressure to cut rates later this year bond markets are foreseeing two slashes the first coming in july the latest jobs report and inflation have come out below expectations and the ongoing trade war with china clouds the outlook on the other hand some data points such as the retail sales figures have been upbeat markets will first observe the fed s projections for interest rates in the dot plot if the central bank aligns with markets and projects two cuts this year the dollar may fall if it only signals one cut the greenback may have room to rise investors will carefully scrutinize the statement and fed chair jerome powell s words at the press conference remarks about inflation employment and interest rates are of high importance see the full preview five factors that will rock usd in a critical decision apart from the fed housing data on tuesday may have an impact only if they both surprise in the same direction the figures often offset each other thursday s numbers will likely be overshadowed by the fed while markit s forward looking purchasing managers indices on friday may already move the market a bit further all in all the fed decision is central to usd price action here are the scheduled events in the us gbp usd technical analysis gbp usd remains under pressure but this pressure may be somewhat easing at least when observing momentum on the daily chart the relative strength index continues pointing to falls but remains above 30 not indicating oversold conditions the currency pair remains far below the 50 100 and 200 simple moving averages some support awaits at 1 2605 which was an initial low in late may the four month low of 1 2558 is another robust line of support 1 2475 provided support in december and 1 2445 was the flash crash low at the wake of the new year initial resistance is at 1 2650 which worked as a support line in june it is followed by 1 2765 that was a double top around the same time further up 1 2815 was a swing high in may 1 2870 was april s low and 1 2960 was a support line in both may and march gbp usd sentiment boris johnson will likely continue flashing his brexit credentials and weigh on the pound the boe may find it hard to remain optimistic after weak gdp data and the fed may not go far enough for markets all in all there is more room to the downside than to the upside the fxstreet poll shows a bearish bias in the short term but a bullish sentiment afterward with rising targets the average objectives have all been downgraded in comparison to recent weeks

oil markets oil traders were kept hoping overnight as markets swung violently from one extreme to another as only hours after plumbing the depths brent prices soared after reports of torpedo attacks on two tankers carrying japanese cargos in the gulf of oman there are no coincidences when it comes to terrorism and in retrospect given that japan is the u s biggest ally in asia it s not difficult to connect the dots especially with prime minister abe wrapping up a high stakes negotiation with iran trying to broker a deal between tehran and washington this blatant act of terrorism was a not so subtle reminder of the enormous supply tail risks in and around the strait of hormuz as the strategic oil supply choke point remains a prime terrorist focal point to disrupt the flow of seaborne oil exports from the middle east despite u s secretary of state mike pompeo laying a browbeat on iran a military escalation is unlikely and given the market s tendency to quickly sidestep lone wolf or small group terrorist attacks oil prices have come off the boil as traders pivot back to the task at hand which is accurately positioning around the hugely bearish massive u s inventory builds amidst the deteriorating global economic backdrop as we head towards the colossal risk events of the year opec meeting and the g20 summit us markets us market received an unexpected bounce from surging oil prices as energy stocks topped the list of winners but investor sentiment remains supported by the one constant that keeps the s p 500 ticking the allure of the federal reserve easy money policy gold markets rising geopolitical risk amplified by us china trade uncertainty all but ensure the gold insurance bid remains alive and well suggesting gold should be on everyone s radar if not in everyone s portfolio last week s u s employment report validated by the higher than expected weekly employment claims overwhelming suggest tariffs are a potent threat to u s growth and by proxy the global economy and while i disagree with the markets overzealous u s rate cuts prognostications but what we do know is if tariffs escalate there will be a need for the fed if not all global central banks to act and even if some positivity emanates from g 20 after the us president weaponised tariffs to support his immigration agenda against mexico who can say with any degree of certainty that he won t redirect his trade angst at another target to support his political ends these mounting uncertainties suggest gold will continue to find a bid on dips if not continue to be hoovered by strategic buyers while there is no imminent danger of a u s recession as gold would be trading at 1400 if that was the case but if a trade war does escalate post g 20 and the president follows through with his tariff threat on china the odds of a u s recession increases exponentially and will swell gold demand gold remains under owned by historical standards and as more cracks appear in the bedrock supporting the global economy gold s glittering appeal will continue to surface after all panning your pay dirt from bedrock cracks can prove extremely rewarding and while i was guilty early in the week of reading far too much risk positivity when the mexican tariff threat eased while arguably distracted by the machinations in oil markets gold continues to provide investors with emotional support and safe harbour in an endless stormy sea hong kong the proposed extradition bill amendment has led to concerns about capital outflows but make no mistake this is a massive deal for hk as if the bill is passed it will most certainly erode the rule of law and autonomy which has been the pillar of hong kong s financial prosperity currency markets the euro given the eu zones trade ties with china the euro fell after the imf suggested that escalating trade tension pose a risk to the eurozone frankly that was a sugar coat as escalating trade tension will represent the most significant threat to germany as domestic recessionary fears will spread like wildfire across the eurozone with the ecb tool kit empty they need the euro to do the heavy lifting suggesting the ecb could dive back into the murky qe water or even take more radical policy measure to weaken the euro i still favour or 1 100 over 1 15 the dollar and while usd bears are getting animated about the prospects of fed cut they could suffer a significant post fomc hangover as the fed is unlikely to be as revisionist as market pricing suggests the malaysian ringgit as expected the myr remain hostage to stable yuan sentiment ahead of g 20 but with the pre g 20 negotiating window all but shut i think traders will get increasing fidgety and price in the worst case scenarios as we near the summit so we continue to favour a weaker myr in the run up to g 20 em asia fx view worsening trade tensions should lead to a fed rate cut and in turn this will provide more policy wiggle room for em asia central banks to be more aggressive with their macro policy buffer given the struggling regional economic backdrop we re anticipating a stronger monetary stimulus response for china and korea and continue favour long usd positions against both currencies given the ringgit s approximately 60 correlation to the yuan weakness we see the ringgit moving closer to the 4 25 level on trade war escalation although we are not positioned in the idr or php yet we think the philippines peso and the indonesian rupiah could be crunched if the bsp and bi both expedite their rate cut cycles matching the fed on the escalating trade war scenario especially if the fed does comply with the markets aggressive three rate cut prognostication

media sco to battle against three forces of evil the leaders of the shanghai cooperation organization sco countries will adopt their bishkek declaration at today s summit kommersant writes adding that a draft declaration had fallen into the newspaper s hands the document emphasizes the need to jointly fight three forces of evil separatism terrorism and extremism the members also agreed to mutually combat protectionism in global trade and cross border crime as well as to build a multipolar world order informed sources in moscow told the paper that one of the summit s highlights would be the signing of a roadmap for cooperation between the sco and afghanistan aimed at assisting in the country s reconstruction afghanistan is a common headache for sco members kyrgyzstan based political scientist igor shestakov told the paper adding that joint efforts in this area are important for all of the organization s members according to kommersant s sources the integration of new sco members india and pakistan is going well the organization escaped the threat of dysfunction after tensions had flared up between the two countries in february 2019 the sco regularly conducts anti terrorist drills that involve russian and chinese troops based on this fact foreign columnists alleged that moscow and beijing sought to create their own version of nato but were unable to do that because of differences on central asia which used to be part of the soviet union but was being taken over by china in this regard higher school of economics professor vladimir lukin told nezavisimaya gazeta that russia and china don t have any political differences concerning central asia since they share the same goals in the region they support stability economic development and secular regimes as for the economy it s not right to say that china is driving russia out of central asia china is not driving russia out it is just increasing its own presence in the region like everywhere else in the world the expert pointed out russia still remains the most important trade partner for some countries particularly for kazakhstan however china has a more powerful economy and the country s economic presence is growing competition between certain companies is possible but it doesn t affect political relations between the two countries lukin emphasized media oil tanker incident heats up tensions between us iran from now on all oil tankers passing through the strait of hormuz are going to have additional security and maritime patrols in the region are going to be beefed up izvestia learned from a source in norway s frontline company whose front altair oil tanker was one of the two vessels that had come under attack in iran s territorial waters on thursday however experts interviewed by the paper say it is too early to blame the incident on tehran read also iran s top diplomat slams us accusations against tehran over tanker attacks the maritime areas where civil navigation is at risk are protected by international groups involving naval ships from various countries us center for naval analyses expert michael kofman told the paper according to him several ships including american and british ones are deployed to the zone where the attack took place their task is to combat pirates and provide assistance to ships in distress oil tankers only carry staff members of private military companies hired by ship owners the expert noted adding that those mercenaries were capable of thwarting attacks by pirates aboard light boats armed with portable grenade launchers and ak rifles but they couldn t detect saboteurs underwater according to head of the russian institute for strategic studies center of the near and middle east vladimir fitin forces seeking to push the us towards a direct armed conflict with iran were behind the tanker attack the expert believes that it could be the arab monarchies or israeli intelligence agencies however he did not rule out that pirates at sea like those active off somalia s coast and at the entrance to the gulf of aden were involved in the incident last year amid growing tensions with the us iran threatened to block the strait of hormuz through which almost 20 of total global oil consumption passes vedomosti notes however this time it would be unreasonable to suspect iran said maria belova of vygon consulting she pointed out that on may 12 four oil tankers had caught fire on the left side of the strait and no one had claimed responsibility for the incident today two vessels are on fire on the right side of the strait and there is no information about the cause of the fire it would make more sense for the iranians to deploy artillery to the strait area and nearby islands to prevent ships from passing belova said professor vladimir sazhin a senior researcher at the russian academy of sciences institute of oriental studies believes that the incident should be blamed on some militant organizations rather than on iranian or arab state agencies in his view terrorists seek to further raise tensions in the persian gulf area izvestia serbia poised to send troops to kosovo belgrade is ready to send troops to kosovo if international forces fail to ensure the security of the region s serb population serbian foreign minister ivica dacic told izvestia however he was hopeful that it wouldn t spiral into an armed conflict and belgrade wouldn t have to ask moscow for assistance according to dacic the albanian side in kosovo is reluctant to make agreements and continues whipping up incidents in order to hinder efforts aimed at reaching a compromise their goal is to intimidate the serbs and make them leave northern kosovo in this situation we continue to remind the international community that kfor must protect the serbs dacic pointed out if the international community fails to respond in accordance with the united nations resolution if the serbs have to face violence if these attacks on them continue then belgrade will have to react and serbia is ready for that however i hope that there will be no need to do it the serbian top diplomat added we are grateful to russia for its support

measures of its operating performance the company believes these non gaap measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on the company s operating performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap financial measures the company also believes that securities analysts investors rating agencies and other interested parties frequently use these non gaap measures in the evaluation of issuers many of which present similar metrics when reporting their results the company s management also uses adjusted ebitdar in order to facilitate retail business operating performance comparisons from period to period prepare annual operating budgets and assess the company s ability to meet its future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements and the company s ability to pay dividends on its common shares as other companies may calculate these non gaap measures differently than the company these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies this press release makes reference to certain comparable financial results expressed on a constant currency basis including comparable sales comparable digital sales and comparable inventory in calculating the sales change including digital sales on a constant currency basis where applicable prior year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year comparable sales this enhances the ability to compare underlying sales trends by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the company calculates comparable inventory levels on a year over year constant currency basis and does not include new store openings after the end of the same comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year definitions and calculations of comparable financial results differ among companies in the retail

with brent d griffiths the ticker larry kudlow just threw some more dirt on the grave of republican debt and deficit concerns president trump s top economic adviser who called federal spending the most unbalanced fiscal story coming of washington really in our history in 2009 on thursday said the deficit which has risen about 80 percent since trump took office and is on track to top 1 trillion for the first time in history doesn t bother me right now i don t think we re at a crisis point now kudlow said in a thursday interview at the peterson institute of international economics he pointed to the fact that the ratio of debt to gdp stands at about 90 percent that by itself is not a catastrophe watch the whole interview here the comment is latest piece of evidence tracing the gop s rapid transformation from a party that held deficit hawkishness as a first principle into one now unbothered by a tide of red ink it has helped unleash advertisement trump campaigned on a pledge to erase 19 trillion in debt over two terms but his signature policy achievement the 1 9 trillion tax cut has accelerated the divergence between federal collections and outlays this week the congressional author of those cuts rep kevin brady r tex suggested to my colleague heather long what mainstream economists contended when the cuts passed that they will not fully pay for themselves we will know in year 8 9 or 10 what revenues it brought in to the government over time so it s way too early to tell brady said kudlow claimed in april that we have already paid for a good chunk of the tax cuts a year ago against the government s own evidence he asserted the deficit was coming down rapidly so far the numbers speak for themselves spending is up 255 billion for the first eight months of the fiscal year the cbo said while revenues are up only 49 billion heather writes corporate tax receipts are down after republicans enacted the largest reduction in business taxes in u s history individual income taxes are basically flat this year they are growing less than the rate of inflation most of the revenue increase is coming from tariffs and more payroll taxes which were not cut in the tax bill and the treasury department announced wednesday that the deficit rose to a record 208 billion in may a 42 percent jump over the same period last year advertisement the response from republicans has amounted to a collective shrug the wall street journal s kate davidson and jon hilsenrath performed something of a forensic autopsy on washington s vanishing interest in taming deficits they found a fundamental shift leading politicians investors and academics to reevaluate whether much higher spending levels might be sustainable the new bottom line the u s despite a record long economic expansion is on course to test just how much it can borrow one reason policymakers are changing their tune government debt has defied expectations by remaining relatively cheap in theory an increased supply of government bonds sold to raise funds when spending exceeds revenues should increase government borrowing costs theory also says big deficits crowd out business borrowing and increase private borrowing costs too the opposite has happened while government debt soared after the 2007 2009 financial crisis 10 year treasury yields have fallen to near 2 from more than 5 in 2006 holding down government interest payments u s business debt rose to 15 trillion in 2018 from 9 trillion in 2006 nevertheless davidson and hilsenrath note the congressional budget office projects the federal government will spend more on interest in 2020 than on medicaid and more in 2025 than on national defense and a recession could reveal the government has overextended itself and limited its ability to jumpstart a recovery advertisement despite lawmakers from both parties ditching their green eyeshades a partisan budget showdown looms this fall speaker nancy pelosi d calif said wednesday she would refuse to lift the debt limit until the administration agrees to a deal to lift spending caps the white house has demanded that the statutory caps remain in place while raising defense spending through a budget maneuver the hill s niv ellis reports house democrats meanwhile have been passing spending bills that would increase funding levels by 17 billion for defense and 34 billion for

2011 with nearly two thirds naming trade or tariffs as the biggest downside risk to their forecasts advertisement but china attempts a positive spin china s point man on trade talks with the u s vice
